# SHIV PURANAM PART FOUR
# CHAPTER TWENTYNINE

Saunaka said :

1. The great narrative of the conversation of Sanatkumara and Vyasa has been heard by me as narrated by you. It has bestowed the knowledge of truth.

2. Now I wish to hear about the creation of Brahma, the manner of its origin and the way in which you heard it from Vyasa.

Suta said :

3. O sage, listen to the divine story that destroys all sins; the variegated story that is being described by me; the story full of meaning and well known details.

4. He who teaches or hears this story repeatedly sustains his family and is honoured in the world of heaven.

5-6. Purusa is eternal and he is of the nature of Sat and Asat as Pradhana and Purusa. The creator of the worlds created Pradhana after becoming Purusa. He created the Creator of all living beings devoted to Narayana. O great sage, understand him to be Brahma of immeasurable strength and prowess. O leading sage, obeisance to that Self-born being from whom the Kalpas and all beings originate.

7.

8. After bowing to that Purusa, lord Hiranyagarbha, I shall explain the excellent mode of creation again.

9. Brahma is the creator; Visnu is the protector and Siva is the annihilator. Even when the time passes there is no other cause of that creation.

10. Being self-born himself the lord, desirous of creating various subjects, created only the waters first. He then instilled virility into them.1

11. The waters are called Nara (belonging to Nara).

i. Manu i, 8,

# Sivapurdna

The waters are the progenies of Nara. Since waters had been his abode he is called Narayana.2

12. The Egg floating in the water assumed golden colour. Brahma himself famous as the self-born was born there,3

13. After staying there for a year, lord Hiranyagarbha, dichotomised that egg and created heaven and earth.4

14. Fourteen worlds were created including those above and below. With the intervening space between those two pieces the lord created the ether.5

15. He created the earth floating in the waters and the ten quarters in the firmament. Then he created the mind, the speech, love and anger and the sexual delight.

16. The excessively brilliant creator created seven mental sons, the sages, Marici, Atri, Arigiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasistha.6

17. They have been decisively termed the seven Brahmas in the Puranas. Brahma again created the Rudras arising from anger.

18. He created the sage Sanatkumara too, the eldest of all. They are thus seven born. The Rudras were born afterwards.

19. Sanatkumara stays with controlled brilliance. From them seven great families originated, all being divine and worshipped by the celestial sages.

20. Endowed with sacred rites they were born along with the other Sages. The lightning, the thunderbolt, the red clouds and the rainbow were created.

21. He created water at the outset. He created the rain-bearing cloud. He created the Rks, the Yajus and the Samans for facilitating Yajnas.7

22. With these he worshipped the gods worthy of being adored. This is what we had heard. He created the gods.

from his mouth, the manes from the chest, men through impregnation and the Asuras from his loins.

23. Living beings high and low were born of his limbs as the patriarch Apava generated the creation of the aquatic beings.

24. When the beings created did not increase he dichotomised his body and became man and woman.8

25. With his greatness he persuaded the universe and created the people. Visnu created the Virat (the cosmic being). Thus the Purusa Viral was created.9

26. Know that he was another Manu that began the age. That lord, Purusa, created all the subjects out of Vairaja.

27. The creations of Visnu were not born of womb. They were long-lived, famous, blessed and possessed of progeny. O excellent sage, thus the premeval creation has been narrated to you on knowing which one attains his cherished goal.

Sita said:

1. When the subjects were created the patriarch Apava as Purusa acquired as his wife Satarupa who was not born of womb.10

2. With his greatness Apava enveloped the heaven and stood virtuously. He the noble soul became Satarupa thus.

3. She performed a penance for a hundred years and attained the Purusa of illumined penance as her husband.

4. The Purusa who was born is called Svayambhuva Manu. His age is said to be seventy-one Yugas.

# 5.

The intelligent Satarupa bore the Vairaja Purusa two sons Priyavrata and Uttanapada of heroic prowess.

# 6.

The blessed lady Kamya, wife of the patriarch Kardama, gave birth to three sons Samra{, Saksi, and Avitprabhu.

# 7.

Lord Uttanapada begot sons equal to Indra. He begot another son Dhruva of divine nature who had the excellent lustre and the inner bliss.

# 8.

Dharma’s daughter, the virtuously born beautiful woman named Suniti was the mother of Dhruva.

# 9.

Even as a child Dhruva performed penance for three thousand divine years wishing for an imperishable status.

# 10.

Lord Brahma, being delighted gave him a stable position as his own, facing the seven sages.

# 11-12.

Two sons, Pus$i and Dhanya were born of Dhruva. Pustf begot of Samuttha five pious sons viz Ripu, Ripunjaya, Vipra, Vrkala and Vrsatejas. The queen of Ripu gave birth to Caksusa Manu.

# 13-16.

Caksusa Manu begot Varuna of Puskarini. An excellent sage, from Manu of great prowess, in Nadala the daughter of the patriarch Vaisyajanma (?) were born ten sons viz Puru, Masa, Satadyumna, Tapasvin, Satyavit, Kavi, Agnistoma, Atiratra, Atimanyu and Suyasas. To Puru, Agneyl bore six sons of great lustre viz Ariga, Sumanas, Khyati, Srti, Angiras and Gaya. Sunltha, wife of Ariga, bore him a son Vena.

# 17.

Due to the misbehaviour of Vena the pious sages became very furious and killed him by very hunkara.

# 18.

Sarasvata Sages were requested by Sunitha for the birth of a son. They then churned and pressed his right hand.

# 19.

When the hand of Vena was churned Prthu was born. He had a bow and a coat of mail even as he was born and was equal to the sun in brilliance.

# 20.

He was indeed an incarnation of Visnu, for protecting the subjects, for the maintenance of virtue and for punishing the wicked.

ii. Manu 7. 41.

# 21.

Prthu, son of Vena, the ancestor of all Ksatriyas protected the earth. He was the first lord of Earth, the first among those anointed in the Rajasuya sacrifice.

# 22.

The two efficient persons Suta and Magadha were born of him. O great Sage, by him the earth in the form of cow was milked for the common welfare.

# 23.

Performing a hundred sacrifices he as a king become the provider of livelihood to all the gods, sages and Raksasas and to men in particular.

# 24.

Two virtuous princes, Vivitasva and Haryak$a were born to Prthu. They were great heroes who had become very famous.

# 25.

Sikhandini gave birth to a son Pracinabarhis. While he roamed on the earth Kusa grasses had their tips towards the East.

# 26.

The daughter of the lord of the Ocean was duly married by him. The great lord, shone all the more when he had a wife.

# 27.

Ten sons were born to Pracinabarhis the great sacrificer, of his wife Samudratanaya.

# 28.

They were Pracetas by name. They had mastered the science of archery. Together they practised virtue and performed penance.

# 29.

They lay sunk in the waters of the ocean for ten thousand years, repeating the Japa of Rudraglta and meditating on Siva.

# 30.

While they were performing penance trees grew on the earth. When the Earth stood unprotected there was a great destruction of subjects.

# 31.

O great king, after attaining boons when they returned they saw the trees. They were furious and wanted to burn them by the power of penance.

# 32.

The Pracetasas created fire and wind from their mouths. The wind uprooted the trees and the fire burnt them.

# 33.

On seeing the destruction of trees and observing that only a few trees were left, the valorous king Soma approached them and said.

Sivapurdrid
Soma said: —

# 34.

O Pracinabarhisas, O kings, subdue your anger. This daughter of the trees, Anubhuta, is a woman of fair complexion.

# 35.

O fortunate ones, she was conceived by me in my womb as I knew the future. Let her be your wife and make the race of the moon flourish.

# 36.

The patriarch Daksa will be born of her. He, the ancient son of Brahma, will become a creator of great brilliance.

# 37.

With half your brilliance, and with half my brilliance this king full of Brahma’s brilliance will make the subjects flourish.

# 38.

Then at the instance of Soma the Pracetasas lovingly took the fair-complexioned lady, daughter of trees, as their wife.

# 39.

O To her, through them was born the patriarch Daksa. Sage, that boy of great brilliance was born of the moon’s parts as well.

# 40.

After creating mentally the mobile and immobile beings, the bipeds and the quadrupeds, Daksa began creation though copulatory process.

# 41.

In accordance with the Sastric injunctions, he virtuously married the daughter of Virana the patriarch, the chaste lady Viranl.

# 42.

He begot of her ten thousand sons Haryasvas. At the instance of Narada they became detached from the world.

# 43.

On hearing of it Daksa again begot of her a thousand sons Subala£vas.

# 44.

Thanks to the instructions of the same sage they too followed the footsteps of their brothers. Unattached and following the path of mendicants they never returned to their parents.

# 45.

On hearing of it he became very furious and cursed the sage thus— O wretch, fond of quarrels, you will never stay permanently anywhere.

12. Repeated. See Gh. 31. VetfSes 14-15.



---


# 46.

Consoled by Brahma, O great sage, he afterwards created women endowed with qualities and in the form of great flames.

# 47-48.

He gave ten daughters to Dharma and thirteen to Kasyapa, two to Brahmaputra and two to Angiras and two to the learned sage KrsaSva. O excellent sage, the remaining twenty-seven daughters, named after the constellations lord Daksa gave to Soma.

# 49.

Asuras and others were born of the daughters of Daksa and had become famous. The universe was filled with them. O great brahmin, the subjects thereafter were born of sexual union.

# 50.

The creation prior to this was through mental concepts, visualisation and touch.

# Saunaka said:

# 51.

Formerly it was said by you that Daksa was born of the thumb of Brahma. How then did he of great penance become the son of Pracetasa again?

# 52.

Suta, it behoves you to clear this doubt of mine. This is also surprising how he attained the status of the father-in-law of Soma.

# Suta said:

# 53.

O sage, birth and destruction happen everyday among the mortals. In every Kalpa these, Daksa and others are born again.

# 54.

He who knows this mode of creation of Daksa of the mobile and immobile beings becomes endowed with progeny and longevity. After death he is honoured in the heavenly region.

13. The first half of this verse is repeated. See Chs. 31. 15.

14. The Verses 47, 48 are repeated. See Ch. 31. Verses 17, 18.

# CHAPTER THIRTYONE

# (Description of the Creation)

Saunaka said:

1. O son of Suta, tell me quickly about the details of the creation of the gods, Danavas, Gandharvas, serpents and Rakṣasas.

Suta said:

2. When the creation did not multiply, the patriarch asked the daughter of Virana, endowed with penance, for the purpose of creation.

3. He created different people by the process of copulation. Intelligent one, listen to them. I shall explain in brief.

4. Uniting with her, the powerful patriarch begot of Virinī five thousand sons.

5-6. Narada, son of Brahma, had heard at the Satra that the creation can take place only through Kaśyapa in the daughters of Dakṣa. So, on seeing the created sons, the sage Narada addressed them thus.

7. “You do not know any direction in the world. Without knowing that what can you create? You are very childish. Proceed only after knowing the world.”

8. Thus addressed by him they all proceeded to know the direction by means of their power. Without being able to reach their end they never returned to their father’s house.

9. On knowing that he created five hundred sons, Narada, the visualiser of all, spoke to them also.

Narada said:

10. How can you create without knowing the extent of the world? All of you are childish. What creation do you propose to make?

Suta said:

11. On hearing his words, Subalaṣvas, sons of Dakṣa,

# 1581

as did the Haryasvas formerly, started in quest of all directions.

12. After reaching Puskara and attaining despair due to the endlessness of the world they do not return even now at the rivers from the ocean.

13. Ever since, O sage, if a brother goes in quest of a brother he perishes. That should not be done by any learned man.

14. Realising that his sons had perished, the patriarch Daksa cursed the noble soul Narada in anger.

15. “O wretch, fond of quarrels, you will never stay anywhere permanently. Quarrel will always occur among the people where you happen to be present.”

16. We have heard that Daksa the patriarch was consoled by Brahma afterwards and that he begot of Virini sixty daughters.15

17. He gave ten of them to Dharma; thirteen to KaSyapa; twenty-seven to the moon and four to Aristanemi.

18. Two to the son of Brahma, two to Angiras and two to the learned Kr<asva now="" listen="" to="" their="" names.&#x3C;="" p="">

19-20. O sage, the wives of Dharma are Arundhati, Vasu, Yami, Lamba, Bhanu, Marutvati, Sahkalpa, Muhurta, Sadhya and Visva. Now listen to their children. ViSve-devas are the sons of Visva, and Sadhya gave birth to Sadh/as.

21. Marutvats were born of Marutvati, Vasus were born of Vasu; the suns were born of Bhanu and the Muhurtajas were born of Muhurta.

22. Ghosa was born of Lamba; Nagavithi was born of Yami and Prthivivisama was born of Arundhati.

23. Sahkalpa of the nature of Truth was born of Sahkalpa. Aya and others were born of Vasu. They are eight. O Saunaka, listen to them.

15. According to the present text Daksa had sixty daughters. Of these he gave 10 to Dharma, 13 to Kasyapa, 27 to Soma, 4 to Ari;tane-min, 2 to Brahmaputra, 2 to Angiras and 2 to Kfsasva. But the assignment is not uniform in all the Puranas. For instance MP (5. 13-14) assigns 15 to Kasyapa instead of 13 and omits 2 of Brahmaputra to complete the given number. The account is found also in RS. Srsti. Ch. 16.

24. Aya, Dhruva, Soma, Dhara, Anila, Anala, Pratyusa and Prabhasa are the eight Vasus by name.

25. Aya’s sons are Vaitanda, Srama, Santa and Muni. Dhruva’s son was lord Kala influencing the worlds.

26. Soma’s son was lord Varcas imparting lustre to others. Dhara’s sons were Dravina and Hutahavyavaha.

27-28. Manohara’s sons were Sasira, Prana and Ramana. Anila’s wife was Siva whose sons were Purojava and Avijnatagati. Anila had only two sons. Kumara was the son of Agni in the grove of Sara grass surrounded by glory.

29. His sons were Sakha, Visakha and Naigameya. The son of Krttikas was called Karttikeya.

30. Pratyusa’s son was Devala a sage. Devala had two sons who too had children and who were intelligent.

31-32. Brhaspati’s sister was a woman of excellence, well-versed in Yoga and she traversed the entire world maintaining celibacy. She became the wife of Prabhasa the eighth of Vasus. O fortunate one, Visvakarman the patriarch was born of him.

33. He was the creator of thousands of skilled arts. He is the architect of the gods. He was maker of all sorts of ornaments. He was the foremost among artisans and craftsmen.

34. He built the aerial chariots of all gods. He is a great Atman whose craft is emulated and made use of by men too.

35-36. According to another version his wife Sarupa gave birth to crores of Rudras such as Raivata, Aja, Bhava, Bhima, Varna, Ugra, Vrsakapi, Ajaikapad, Ahirbudhnya, Bahurupa, Mahat etc. Eleven of them are important. O sage, listen to their names.

Kumara Karttikeya is one of the four brothers, the other three being Sakha, Visakha and Naigameya. He is the son of six Krttika mothers and therefore named Karttikeya and Sanmatura (MP. 527). The legend is found in all the Saiva Puranas. Prof. Agrawal gives a mystical interpretation of the episode. MP— A study PP. 68-71.

The patriarch Vigvakarma, son of Vasu Prabhasa, was the craftsman of the gods and entrusted with the work of building chariots, ornaments, palaces etc. MP 5. 27-V8, See P. 389 note 295.

37-38. These eleven are the Rudras, lords of the three worlds viz:—Ajaikapad, Ahirbudhnya, Tvastr, the powerful Rudrahara of many forms, Tryambaka, Aparajita, Vf§akapi, Sambhu, Kapardin and Raivata. 18

39. Thus a hundred Rudras of immense prowess have been mentioned to you. Now listen to the names of Ka€yapa’s wives, O excellent sage.

# CHAPTER THIRTYTWO

# (The family of Kaiyapa)

Suta said:

1-2. O brahmin, they are Aditi, Surasa, Aristela, Danu, Surabhi, Vinata, Ila, Tamra, Krodhavasa, Kadru and Muni. Now listen to the names of their sons. In the previous excellent Manvantara twelve excellent gods were born.

3-6. They are Tusitas. During the intervening period of the Vaivasvata and Caksusa Manvantaras they consulted one another the welfare of the worlds. After meeting together forspoke — “We will enter Aditi born. This will happen for the welfare of the gods.” After conferring they were born of Aditi daughter of Daksa and Kasyapa son of Marici. Visnu and Indra were born again.

7-9. They along with Aryaman, Dhatr, Tvastr, Pusan, Vivasvat, Savitr, Mitravaruna, Amsa, Bhaga and Atitejas are the twelve Adityas. Those who were born before as Tusitas were born again as the twelve Adityas in the Caksusa Manvantara, O Saunaka thus the names of Aditi’s sons have been mentioned to you.

1 8. Sivapurana proposes to recount the names of eleven Rudras but actually mentions twelve names. As a matter of fact Tva.stii and Bahurupa are identical names. Compare MP (5. 29-30) where Tvasta is replaced by its corresponding name Bahurupa. In regard to the names of the eleven Rudras the Puranas are not unanimous.

31. Kasyapa, son of Marlci, endowed with great penance, begot of them sixty thousand sons delighting the Danavas.

32. Kalakhanjas, the powerful sons of Puloma, lived in Hiranyapura. They could not be killed either by the Danavas or by the gods.

33. Vipracitti’s sons, born of Simhika, were later killed by Arjuna by the grace of Brahma.

# Chapter Thirtythree

# (Description of the creation)

Suta said:

1-5. Such is the creation as mentioned in the Manvantara, Svarocisa, O dear. Now I shall describe the creation as evolved by Brahman while offering oblations in the elaborate Varuna sacrifice in the great Vaivasvata Manvantara. All the Brahmarsis born in the beginning, Pitamaha made his mental sons. When a great fight ensued between the gods and the Danavas, Diti lost all her sons. She approached Kasyapa and propitiated him. The delighted Kasyapa asked her to choose a boon as she pleased. She chose the boon that she be favoured with a son of immeasurable power capable of slaying Indra.

6. He granted her the boon of her choice. The sage of great penance advised her celibacy and other restraints for a hundred years.

7. The pious fair-complexioned lady conceived. She began to observe celibacy and other restraints.

8. After impregnating Diti, Kasyapa of noble sacred rites went away satisfied for the performance of penance.

9. Indra waited for finding out a weak point in her. He found one such when the period of hundred years was short by a year.

10. Due to the gravity of the event destined to happen, once Diti did not wash her feet. She went to sleep with head hanging down.

11. In the meantime Indra entered her belly with the thunderbolt. He cut off the foetus into seven pieces.

12. While being split into seven the foetus began to cry in seven different tones. Indra told the foetus “Do not cry, Do not cry” repeatedly. He cut them again but they did not die. O sage, being down they him with

14. O brahmin sage, at the will of Siva, they eschewed their Daitya nature. They were accepted by Indra with due fraternity.

15. In the name of Maruts they became gods of great prowess. Thus traversing the sky the fortynine Maruts became assistants of Indra.

16. When they flourished, Visnu the patriarch, offered them kingdoms beginning with Prthu. Listen to that.

17. Arista was the heroic person. Krsna the patriarch was ever victorious. Parjanya was the presiding deity of clouds. This entire universe belongs to him.

18. O great sage, I have explained the creation of living beings to you. Listen to the division of kingdoms. I shall explain that duly now.

19. After crowning Prthu the son of Vena in the emperorship, Brahma began to assign the kingdoms in due order.

20. He crowned Soma in the kingdom of birds, creepers, stars, planets, sacrifices and austerities.

21. He crowned Varuna in the kingdom of waters; Vaiśravana as the lord of kings; Visnu as the lord of Aditvas and Pavaka as the lord of Vasus.

22. He crowned Daksa as the lord of patriarchs, Indra as the lord of Maruts, and Prahlada of great strength as the lord of Daityas and Danavas.

23. He crowned Vaivasvata Yama in the kingdom of Pitrs, Matrs, Vratas, Mantras and cows.

24. He crowned the trident-bearing Siva, in the kingdom of Yaksas, Raksasas, kings, goblins and ghosts.

25. He crowned Himavat as the lord of mountains, the ocean of rivers, the tiger of deer and Bull as the lord of cows.

26. He crowned the banyan tree in the kingdom of plants and trees. Thus the kingdom was assigned everywhere by the lord of subjects.

27. The lord of the universe, the soul of all, established the son of patriarch Vairaja in the kingdom in the east.

# CHAPTER THIRTYFTVE

# (The description of Vaivasvata)

Suta said:

1. Vivasvat was born of Daksa’s daughter and KaSyapa the great sage. His wife was Samjfia, daughter of Tvas{r and also known as Surenuka.
2. Due to the unbearable heat of her husband she in her prime of youth was dissatisfied.
3. Being scorched and not being able to hear the brilliance of the lustrous sun, the fair-complexioned lady was excited and sorrowful. O the sun begot of
4. the sage, three offsprings her: the patriarch Manu Sraddhadeva, Yama and Yamuna born as twins.
5. On seeing the brilliance of the sun as unbearable as the fire at the final dissolution she created Chaya of herself.
6. She of illusory form told Samjfia: “O sweet-smiled auspicious lady, what shall I do for you, please tell me.”
7. Samjfia said: “Welfare unto you. I go to my father’s house alone. Indeed you have to stay in this house without aberration.
8. These two well-behaved sons and this pretty girl should be happily protected if you wish to please me.”
9. Chaya said: “O lady, I shall brook their misdeeds even as much as pulling out my hair. I shall make no complaint to you. O goddess, you can go away happily.”
10. Suta said: Ashamed on being addressed thus, the lady went to her father’s house but was rebuked by him. He urged her again and again to return to her husband.
11. She assumed the form of a mare. Going to Northern Kurus she wandered among the people.
12. The sun took her for Samjfia and begot of her a son the Manu Savarni.

14. Though requested by Samjfia, Chaya did not love the elder children. She loved her own son more and fondled him always.

15. The younger brother Yama could not hear that. He did not forgive. Ever since childhood he was furious and ill-tempered due to the gravity of what was destined to happen later.

16. When Yama, son of Vivasvat threatened Chaya she became infuriated and cursed him angrily.

17. Due to excessive anger she cursed “Let your leg fall off”. Yama approached his father with palms joined in reverence and said.

18-20. “I was agitated due to Chaya’s words. I am sorry and frightened of the curse. I had only said that a mother shall have impartial and equal love for all her children. She has lost affection for us. She nurtures only the youngest one. Hence I raised my foot. It behoves you to forgive me. O lord of gods, O foremost among the refulgent ones, I have been cursed by my mother. O lord of rays, let not my leg fall off by your grace.”

The sun said:

21. O son, there shall be a great cause for this. That was why you too who know virtue and speak the truth had been infuriated.

22. It is not possible to make your mother’s words false. Worms will take away the flesh from your leg and go to the earth.

23. Her words will come up true and you will also be saved. Have no doubt, O deer, cheer up your mind, O lord.

Suta said:

24. O great sage, after saying thus to his son Yama, the sun angrily spoke to Chaya.

The sun said:

25. O beloved wife, O evil-minded angry lady, what it is that you have done? Why do you love one son more? You shall tell me.

Silta said:

On hearing the words of the sun she told him the truth. Scorched by him she consoled him thus.

Chdyd said:

27. This fierce form of yours was not pleasant to Samjfia. She was scorched by your excessive brilliance. She could not bear it. She now resides on the grassy plain in a forest. O lord of rays, she endowed with the power of Yoga. She has resorted to yogic practice. She is praiseworthy. O lord of gods, be favourable to her by sending the message of your opinion.

28. I shall change your form. I shall make it pleasingly brilliant.

Suta said:

On hearing this, the sun was appeased.

30. The sage Tvasfc: put him on the turner’s lathe and sharpened him further. His blazing form was slightly reduced in brilliance.

31. When the form was made more pleasingly brilliant by Tvastr it shone splendidly. Then resorting to Yogic practice he saw his wife Samjfia.

32. He assumed the form of a horse and approached her for sexual indulgence with her who could not be overwhelmed by any living being due to her lustre and observance of restraint. O sage, in the course of the sexual activity she suspected him to be another man. Hence she received the semen through the mouth into the nostril.

33. Thence were born the twin gods ASvins, the foremost among physicians. They are known as Nasatyas and Dasras.

34. The sun showed his pleasingly splendid form to them. On seeing her husband she was extremely delighted.

35. The chaste lady returned to the house with her husband with the face beaming with pleasure. The pair rejoiced more than before.

37. This incident distressed the mind of Yama. As pious king he gladdened the subjects virtuously.

39. Yama of great lustre attained the lordship of the names and the guardianship of the quarters.

38. Savarni Manu became the patriarch. In the Savarnika Manvantara he will become the future Manu by virtue of his action.

40-42. The lord is performing penance even today on the top of Meru21. Their younger sister, the famous Yami, became the most excellent river Yamuna, the sanctifier of all the worlds. He is called Savarni Manu in the world. He who listens to or retains in memory this origin of the gods attains great fame. Should he suffer from any adversity he will be rid of it.

# CHAPTER THIRTYSIX

# ( The description of the nine sons and the race of Manu )

Suta said:

1. Nine sons all equal to him were born of Vaivasvata Manu. Later they became very lofty, bold and devoted to the virtues of Ksatriyas.

2. They were Ik$vaku, Sibi, Nabhaga, Dhrs^a, Saryati, Nari^yanta, Nabhaga, Karusa and Priyavrata.22

3-5. Desirous of sons, Manu the patriarch performed a sacrifice. O great sage, when no sons were born as a result of the sacrifice, the famous Ila was born, wearing divine garments, bedecked in divine ornaments and with a

divine body. Manu the chastiser addressed her as Ila and said “Follow me”. Ila replied to him.

Ila said:

— She spoke these words to the patriarch desirous of a son “O foremost among the eloquent, I am born of the parts of Mitra and Varuna.

I am approaching them. I shall never be interested in sinful things.” After saying this, the chaste lady approached Mitra and Varuna and spoke with palms joined in reverence “O great sages, I am born in the sacrifice of Manu through your parts. I have come to you. Please tell me. What I can do for you. O lord, create either sons so that your race may flourish.”

Stita said:

When the chaste lady born in the sacrifice of Manu said, the sages Mitra and Varuna spoke thus respectfully.

Mitra and Varuna said:

O virtuous beautiful lady of fair complexion, both of us are pleased with your self-control, humility and truth.

O blessed lady, you will attain our fame. You alone will become the son establishing the family of Manu.

You will be famous in the three worlds as Sudyumna, beloved of the universe, virtuous in conduct and enhancer of the race of Manu.

Suta said:

On hearing that she returned to her father’s presence. On the way, getting an opportunity, Budha invited her for sexual intercourse.

King Pururavas was born of her out of the union with Budha. O intelligent one, this son was the handsome and intelligent man who later became the husband of Urvasi.

16. After bearing the son Pururavas she became Sudyumna as a result of Siva’s grace.

17. Sudyumna had three very virtuous heirs Utkala, Gaya and the powerful Vinatasva.

18. O brahmin, O great sage, Utkala was assigned the country Utkala; Vinatasva was given the territories on the West and Gaya was given Gaya and the eastern territories. O dear, when Manu passed away, the earth was divided into ten regions.

19. Iksvaku the eldest son got the central territory. At the instance of Vasistha, Sudyumna gave the virtuous territory Pratisthana to Pururavas. O great sages, Sudyumna had the characteristics of both man and woman. The Sakas were the sons of Narisyanta. Nabhaga’s son Ambarisa got the region Bahlaka and so was known as Bahleya.

20-24. Saryati had a son and a daughter. The son was known as Anarta and the daughter as Sukanya who later became the wife of Cyavana. Anarta’s son was Raibhya known also as Raivata.

25. In the territory of Anarta he got the city KuSasthali which was extremely brilliant and was the seventh among seven cities.

26. He had a hundred sons of whom the eldest and the most excellent was Kakudmin. He was brilliant, strong, virtuous and a protector of brahmins.

27. A daughter Revati was born to Kakudmin. She was endowed with great beauty, She was another Laksmi.

28. The king Kakudmin the lord of all went to

Brahma’s region near Brahma, accompanied by his daughter in order to ask him about a suitable bridegroom for her.

29. While dance and music was going on, he stood there waiting for a moment near Brahma.

30. Although it was only a Muhurta in Brahma’s region many Yugas had passed by. But O sages, the king Kakudmin did not know anything about it.

31. Then he bowed to Brahma the great Atman, humbly and with palms joined in reverence told him about his mission.

32. On hearing his purpose the patriarch Brahma laughed. Addressing the great king Kakudmin, he said.

Brakmd said:

33. Listen, O King Kakudmin, O lord of the earth, son of Raibhya, to my words with attention. I shall tell you the truth particularly.

34. All those bridegrooms you had in view have been killed by the efflux of time. Even their family is extinct. Time is the devourer of everything.

35. O king, your city too has been destroyed by Punyajanas, the Rak§asas. It is now the twenty-eighth Dvapara Yuga and the city has been rebuilt by Krsna.

36. In the name of Dvaravati because it has many entrances, it is very beautiful. It is protected by the Bhojas, Vr§nis and Andhakas with Krsna as their leader.

37. O king, now go there and give this daughter of yours to Baladeva the son of Vasudeva.

Suta said:

38. Thus commanded, the king bowed to him and went to that city. On realising that many Yugas had elapsed he was surprised along with his daughter.

39. Then he gave his daughter, the youthful maiden, Revati to Bala the brother of Krsna in conformity with the Sastric rituals.

The sages said:

# 41.

Raivata stayed in Brahma’s region for many Yugas. He returned to the mortal world as a young man. This is my great doubt.

# 42.

Suta said: O sages, near Brahma there is no old age, hunger, thirst, aberration or premature death to any one.

# 43.

Therefore the king did not attain old age or death, nor his daughter. After consulting Brahma about the bridegroom he returned still a young man.

# 44.

Going to the divine city Dvaravati rebuilt by Krsna, he got his daughter married to Bala.

# 45.

Hundred sons were born to that virtuous great lord. Through many wives Krsna too had innumerable sons.

# 46.

The family of the two noble souls was very great. All the Ksatriyas in every quarter became delighted and virtuous.

# 47.

Thus the race of Saryati has been narrated to you. O brahmins, I shall succinctly mention the details of others too. Listen attentively.

# 48.

Nabhaga had a son Dhrsta. After establishing the Ksatriya race and performing the brahminical rites he attained brahminhood.

# 49.

Dhrsta’s race originally Ksatriya became brahmin family on the earth. Karusa’s descendants the Karusas were Ksatriyas, insubjugable in war.

# 50.

Nrga who was also a son of Manu was a liberal donor of riches to brahmins and of cows.

# 51.

Once due to an error in his charitable gift of a cow, prompted by his own sins and crooked intellect, he became a chameleon and was redeemed by Srikrsna.

# 52.

An excellent son was born to him named Prayati, the knower of virtues. This I have heard from Vyasa and have now briefly mentioned to you.

Prsadhra, a son of Manu was made the keeper of

cows by his preceptor. During the nights, observing the posture of heroes, he diligently looked after the cows.

54. Once a tiger entered the cowshed to attack the cows. On hearing the shrieks of the cows he woke up. Strong that he was he seized a sword to kill it and started.

55. On seeing the lord armed with a sword the frightened tiger slipped away. Not knowing it and mistaking a reddish brown cow as the tiger he hit it with his sword on its head.

56. Due to rain and gust of wind in the night he was deluded. Thinking, that the tiger had been killed he returned to his place.

57. When the night dawned into day he got up and went there. He saw only the cow killed and not the tiger. He felt dejected.

58. On hearing about the incident and realising that he had committed a sin unconsciously and not wilfully, the preceptor cursed him — “Become a Sudra, not a Ksatriya.”

59. On being cursed by his preceptor, the family priest out of anger, Prsadhra started from there and went to the great forest.

60. Dejected by sufferings he became detached and practised Yoga. He burnt himself in conflagration and attained the greatest goal.

61. Kavi, son of Manu, was highly intelligent due to Siva’s blessings. After enjoying divine pleasures here he attained the rare salvation hereafter.

# 2.

Before them O brahmins, there were no kings in Aryavarta. Of them the eldest was Vikuksi. He became the king of Ayodhya.

# 3-4.

Listen to one of his misdeeds. He wanted to perform Sraddha but before performing the same he ate a rabbit and came to be known as Sasada. Abandoned by Iksvaku, he entered a forest.

# 5.

When Iksvaku passed away he was installed a king at the instance of Vasistha. He had fifteen sons of whom the chief was Sakuni.

# 6.

They all became kings and protectors of the northern country. Ayodha’s son was the powerful king Kakutstha.

# 7.

Kakutstha’s son was Arinabha. His son was Prthu. Prthu’s son was Vistarasva. From him was born Indra the lord of people.

# 8.

Indra’s son was Yuvanasva, the ruler of Sravasta. His son was Sravastaka who built Sravasti. Sravastaka’s son was Brhada£va.

# 9.

His son was Yuvanasva and Kuvalasva was his son. Since he slew Dhundhu he became the excellent king Dhundhumara.

# 10-11.

Kuvalasva had hundred sons who were excellent archers. He was entrusted with the kingdom by his father. After transferring the royal glory to the son the king entered the forest. But Uttahka prevented him.

# Uttanka said:

# 12-14.

Listen. You shall protect the earth virtuously. O king, only when protected by you can the earth be relieved of excitement and sorrow. It does not behove you to go to the forest. There is a Danava, proud of his strength near my hermitage, in the snow-covered wilderness, full of sea-sand. He is indestructible even to the gods. He has a huge body and is very strong.

He stays underground concealed by the sand. The terrible Raksasa son of the demon Madhu is Dhundhu by name.

16. He stays there performing a terrible penance for the destruction of the worlds. At the end of every year he exhales terribly.

17. When he exhales, the whole world including mountains, forests and wilderness, quakes. Blazing flames with pink smoke smoulder everywhere.

18. Hence, O king, I cannot stay in my hermitage. Strong one with huge arms ward him off desiring the welfare of the worlds.

19. Let the worlds become happy and peaceful after he had been killed by you. O lord of earth, you alone can slay him. O a boon been granted.

20. Sinless one, great has to you. Visnu will heighten your splendour by his own splendour.

21. Great virtue accrues from the protection of the subjects. A similar opportunity is wanting in the forest. Let not your mind be directed that way.

22. O leading king, nowhere such a virtue exists as it does in the protection of the subjects. This has been pursued by the saintly kings of yore.

23. Thus requested the saintly king entrusted his son Kuvalasva with the task of thwarting Dhundhu.

24. “O holy lord, O excellent brahmin, I have already laid aside my weapons. Here is my son who will surely destroy Dhundhu.”

25. Having said thus and instructed his son the king proceeded with penance. Kuvalasva accompanied by Uttanka went to fight with Dhundhu.

26. At the approach of Uttanka and for the benefit of the worlds, lord Vi§nu entered him with his splendour.

27. When the invincible Kuvalasva started there was a loud shout in the heaven. “This glorious prince will slay Dhundhu.”

28. The gods surrounded him with garlands of flowers. They praised him saying “Be victorious, Be long-lived.”

29. The most excellent among the victorious, the king went there accompanied by his sons. He caused an ocean to be dug in the midst of that vast expanse of sand.

30. O brahminical sage, heightened in strength by the splendour of Visnu he became very brilliant and stronger.

31. O brahmin, the demon Dhundhu was found out, concealed beneath the sand towards the western quarter as the sons of the king dug up the place.

32. He appeared to consume all the worlds out of fury in the fire emerging from his mouth. Water too gushed out from him as from the moon-stone at the moonrise.

33. The hundred sons were scorched and burnt in the fire. O great sage, among them only three survived.

34. O leading brahmin, then the king of great splendour rushed at the very powerful Raksasa, the brahmin-slayer Dhundhu.

Vyasa said: —

1. On hearing about the excellent solar race of Sraddhadeva, the sage Saunaka respectfully asked Suta.

Saunaka said:

2. O Suta, disciple of Vyasa, of long life, obeisance be to you. A divine and pious story has been narrated to us.

3. It has been mentioned by you that Sraddhadeva is the progenitor of the solar race. I have a doubt therein which I shall mention before you.

4. How did the sun become Sraddhadeva? I wish to hear this. O Please clear this doubt with pleasure.

5. Holy lord, please mention the glory and the benefit of Sraddha rite whereby the manes are pleased and bless the performer with prosperity.

6. I wish to hear this too, namely the creation par excellence of the manes. O intelligent one, please mention this particularly. Have mercy on me.

Suta said: O Saunaka, mention everything concerning

7-9. the creation of the manes. This was narrated to the intelligent Markandeya by Sanatkumara. I shall mention it to you. It bestows the benefit of all cherished desires. Bhisma the foremost of the virtuous lying on the bed of arrows was requested by Yudhisthira to whom he spoke thus.

Yudhisthira said:

10. How is nourishment achieved by a man desirous of nourishment? I wish to hear this. What is it that makes a man free from distress?

SUta said :

# 11.

On hearing the question of Yudhisthira, Bhisma the knower of Dharma spoke with pleasure even as everyone was listening.

# Bhisma said: —

# 12.

O Yudhisthira, those who perform Sraddha rites with pleasure delight everyone through them as a result of the favour of the manes.

# 13-15.

Men desirous of benefits perform Sraddhas, keeping in view, the father, the grandfather and the great-grandfather in three balls of rice. O Yudhisthira, the manes bless the man desirous of piety with piety, desirous of progeny with progeny and desirous of nourishment with nourishment.

# Yudhisthira said :

# 16:

Some manes are in the heaven and some are in the hell. The fruit accruing to the living beings is determined by their activity.

# 17.

How do the Sraddhas go to the manes? How those in the hell can derive the benefit?

# 18.

I have heard that even the gods worship the manes. I wish to hear this. Please mention this in detail.

# Bhisma said :

# 19.

O suppressor of enemies, in this context, I shall narrate an event as I have heard from my father who had left this world.

# 20.

At the time of Sraddha, the ball of rice for my father was kept ready by me. My father split the ground and requested me to offer the same into his hand.

# 21.

Thinking that it was not the procedure enjoined in the Kalpa texts I placed the Pingala on the Kusa grass without further thought.

# 22.

“O sinless one, O most excellent of the descendants of Bharata, gladdened by me my father spoke in sweet words.

O most excellent of men, I only tested you. I have been redeemed by you the knower of sacred rites and a good scholar. I have been blessed with a real heir in you.

26. Being delighted I shall grant you excellent boons lovingly. Accept them. They are difficult to obtain in the three worlds.

When he had — saluted him with palms

Santanu said:

31. O dear, listen. I shall explain your question factually. The entire “Pitrkalpa” has been heard by me from Markandeya.

32. O dear, what you ask me now I had asked the sage Markandeya. He, the knower of sacred rites, replied to me.

33. O king listen. Once as I looked up into the sky, I saw a great aerial chariot coming over the mountain.

34-35. I saw in the aerial chariot a great blazing mass of splendour as brilliant as glowing coal and very pleasing to the mind having nothing to excel it. I saw a man of the size of a thumb lying therein. He was very brilliant as if fire had been placed over fire.

36. I bowed to him. With my head bent down, I asked the holy lord. “O holy lord, how may we know you?”

39. My seven brothers are invincible and their families are established. But we pursue the rites of ascetics restraining the Atman in the Atman.

O 40. Even as I was born I became famous as Kumara. sage, hence I am called Sanatkumara (the eternal bachelor).

41. Since you have piously performed penance with a desire for my vision I have appeared before you. Welfare be to you. What will of yours shall carry out?

42. When he said this I told him holy lord, listen. Please narrate factually the original creation of the Pitrs.

43. When requested thus he said to me. Listen to everything factually. O dear one, I shall explain to you the auspicious creation of the Pitrs truthfully.

Sanatkumara said:

44. Formerly Brahma created the gods and said to them, “Worship me”. But they who sought benefits eschewed him and worshipped the Atman.

45-46. They were cursed by Brahma thus. You will be deluded and become senseless. Hence unable to know anything and being insensible they bowed to Pitamaha and said “Please bless us.” Being requested thus he said to them for the sake of expiation.

47. “Ask your sons. You will then attain perfect knowledge.” Urged thus the senseless ones asked their sons boldly.

O 48-50. They were asked to perform expiatory rites. sinless one, the gods were thus addressed by the sons. “Let the sons be approached.” The gods who had been cursed by Brahma told him that the sons had gone away. Then Brahma told the gods thus “O gods, listen, You are not Brahmavadins, the believers in Brahma’s cult.

51 Hence what has been mentioned by the sons, the

most excellent of the perfectly wise shall be followed without hesitation and not otherwise.

52. O dwellers of heaven, let the gods and the Pitrs worship one another with great delight. This will confer the cherished desires.” —O

53. Sanatkumara said: great sage, then their doubts were cleared. With delight they became the mutual bestowers of happiness at the instance of Brahma.

54. Then the gods said “Since you addressed us as sons you will undoubtedly become Pitrs.

55. In the Sraddha of the Pitrs, undoubtedly the performer will propitiate Soma who being delighted and enhanced by the offering shall gladden the worlds.

56-58. They will delight the ocean, the mountain and the forest, all consisting of the mobile and immobile beings. Those who desire nourishment and perform Sraddha rites are given nourishment by the Pitrs who are propitiated. Those who give three Pincjas in the Sraddha mentioning the names and Gotras delight the Pitrs wherever they be and are looked after by them.

59-60. Let these words be truthful. Whether gods or Pitrs we are father and sons successively. Thus the Pitrs who became sons virtuously were famous in the world as mutual beneficiaries.

# CHAPTER FORTYONE

# (The attainment of the seven hunters)

Sanatkumara said:

1. O foremost among the performers of penance, the Pitrs in the heaven are seven in number. Four of them are embodied and three bodiless.

2. The primordial groups of gods, brahmins and others worship them. With the power of their Yoga they strengthen and gladden Soma.



---

# 3-6.

Hence people shall offer Sraddhas especially to the Yogins. A silver vessel or a vessel with silver when offered with Svadha, delights the Pitrs. When the sun is in the northern transit he shall make offerings in the fire or in its absence in water. He shall propitiate fire-god, Soma or Yama. Those who delight the Pitrs with devotion are delighted by Pitrs. The Pitrs bestow nourishment, offspring, heaven, health and other desired objects.

# 7.

O sage, the rites of Pitrs are better than the rites of the gods. O brahmin sage, since you are a devotee of the Pitrs you shall be free from old age and death.

# 8.

O sage, the goal attained by devotion to the Pitrs is not attained by the practices of Yoga. O great sage, so devotion to the Pitrs shall be pursued with care.

Markandeya said:

# 9.

After saying thus and immediately bestowing the vision of perfect knowledge the lord of the gods disappeared.

# 10.

O Bhisma, listen again. Formerly, even after learning the code of Yoga, the brahmin sons of Bharadvaja were degraded due to their evil course.

# 11.

Their names which indicate their activities are Vagdusta (defiled in speech), Krodhana (angry), Himsra (violent), Pisuna (backbiter), Kavi (poet), Svasrsa (self-creating) and Pitrvartin (worshipping the pitrs).

# 12.

O dear, the sons of KauSika became the disciples of Garga. When their father had expired they went in exile.

# 13.

At the instance of their preceptor they looked after his cow and her calf. All of them were unjust in their actions. O descendant of Bharata, once in their course of wandering in the forest, they were oppressed by hunger.

# 14.

They had the cruel intention of injuring the cow then.

# 15.

Kavi and Svasrsa forbade them to do so. But they could not be prevented from that act.

# 16.

The brahmin Pitrvartin who performed Sraddha everyday with devotion to the Pitrs spoke to them angrily.

# 17.

If it is not possible to stop this do it with the Pitrs in view. Perform the Sraddha, ye all cautiously.

---

Um&#x26;saihhita
18. If performed thus, the cow will attain piety undoubtedly. By worshipping Pitrs we shall not be affected by sin.

19. O descendant of Bharata, on being advised thus, they all sprinkled the cow with sacred water, dedicated it to the Pitrs and used it as their food.

— After eating the cow they said the preceptor to saying “The cow is killed by a tiger. Let the calf be accepted.”

20. The sage accepted the calf with great distress. The killers of the cow became sinful by their false reverence and service. O dear, due course, when their term of life expired the seven brothers passed away.

21. They were reborn as the sons of a hunter as a result of their cruelty, violence, being ignoble towards the preceptor and their over-indulgence in fierce violence. They were reborn in the country of DaSarnas. 44 They were strong, intelligent and experts in piety.

22. They were engaged in the practice of sacred rites. They were free from the delusion of hunting animals. On the beautiful mountain Kalafijara they passed their time with distress.

23. Recollecting the event of their death the forest-roamers became forbearers, free from Dvandvas and averse to taking gifts.

# CHAPTER FORTYFOUR

# (The birth of Vyasa)

The sages said:

1-3. O Suta of great intellect, O store-house of mercy, please narrate the birth of Vyasa. O holy lord, please satisfy our curiosity. Vyasa’s mother is known as Satyavati. She was married to king Santanu. How was Vyasa the great Yogin born of her from Parasara? There is a great doubt in regard to that. It behoves you to remove that doubt.

Suta said:

4. Once, while he was making his pilgrimage, Parasara the yogin casually came to the auspicious and beautiful banks of the Yamuna.

5. The righteous soul spoke to the ferryman who was taking his meals, “Take me across the Yamuna quickly in your boat.”

6. When the ferryman was thus urged by the sage, he spoke to his daughter Matsyagandha: “Girl, quickly take this sage to the other bank in the boat.

7. This sage, O fortunate girl, is born of the womb of DrsyanS. He is the ocean of sacred rites. He has mastered the four Vedas. Now he desires to cross this river.

8. Thus directed by her father, Matsyagandha began to take the great sage of solar splendour seated in the boat across the river.

9. That great Yogin who had never been fascinated even on seeing the beauty of the celestial damsels became overwhelmed by lust towards her, in the circumstances.

10. Desirous of clasping the beautiful daughter of the fisherman, the sage touched her in the right hand with his light hand.

11. The wide-eyed lass spoke to him smilingly, “O sage of controlled speech, why do you intend to perpetrate this despicable deed?”

12. O most intelligent one, you are born of the beautiful family of Vasi$tha. O brahmin, I am the daughter of a Ni$ada. How can our union be proper?



---


1628 Sivapurina

13. O excellent sage, birth as a man is very difficult to obtain; especially that as a brahmin. Even there the state of an ascetic is very rarely achieved.

14. It is extremely surprising that you endowed with learning, good physique, speech, noble birth and good conduct have become subservient to the arrows of Kama!

15. Then she thought within: “If this Yogin engages himself in the vicious act there is none in the world to prevent him due to his power of inflicting curse.”

16. —“O holy sage,” thus she said to the great sage lord, “please forbear till I take you to the other bank.”

17. On hearing her words the king of Yogins ParaSara left off her hand. He reached the other shore.

18. Afflicted with lust the sage caught hold of the lass. Tremblingly the lass spoke to the merciful sage.

19. “O great sage, I have foul smell and black complexion. I am the daughter of a Nisada. You are the most excellent of Yogins of extremely liberal thoughts.

20. The union between us is not proper as of a piece of worthless glass with gold. The sexual union of two persons of the same class and features may be conducive to bliss.”

21. As the sage addressed her thus, the damsel was instantly converted into Yojanagandha, (one whose fragrant odours spread to a Yojana), one of fine features and beauty.

22. Afflicted by lust the sage caught hold of her again. On seeing him bent upon seizing her she said again.

23. “It is mentioned in the Vedas that sexual intercourse shall be indulged in at night; not during the day. There is great harm in having sexual intercourse during the daytime. It is censured. Now

24. Hence please wait till the night falls. All the men will see us and so shall my father who stands at the other bank.”

25. On hearing the words uttered by her, the leading sage immediately created a screen of snow, thanks to the strength of his merit.

26. When the sheet of mist spread and it looked just

as night, the girl, afraid of submitting herself to sexual intercourse, spoke to the sage again.

# 27.

“O Yogin, your Osemen never fails. You may enjoy me and go away. holy lord, I shall become pregnant, what will be my fate then?

# 28.

O intelligent sage, my virginity will be ruined, People will laugh at me. What will I tell my father?”

Paraiara said: — O

# 29.

O maiden, beloved girl, sport with me freely with loving emotion. You tell me what you desire. I shall fulfil it.

# 30.

By making my advances fruitful you will be known as Satyavatl. You will deserve the respect of all Yogins and even the gods.

Satyavati said :

# 31-32.

If neither my father nor mother nor any other person on the earth comes to know of this, if my virginity is not affected, O lord, if the son born of me attains wonderful power like you, if there be sweet odour in my body for ever and if there be fresh youth in me, accept me then.

Parafara said: me O beloved your

# 33.

Listen to me O beloved girl, all desires will be fulfilled. A son of great fame of Visnu’s part will be born to you.

# 34.

Know that there is a reason that I have become lustful. Even on seeing the beauty of celestial damsels my mind was never deluded anywhere before.

# 35.

O lass, on seeing you of fish odour I was enamoured. lines drawn by Brah *na on the forehead cannot prove untrue. O comely lady, your son will be the author of the Puranas, the classifier of the Vedas and renowned in the three worlds.

# 36.

O great sage, after saying this and enjoying the beautiful lass, the sage, an expert in Yoga, took his bath in the Yamuna and went away quickly.

38. She conceived and immediately gave birth in an island on the Yamuna49 to a son with the lustre of the sun and resembling Kamadeva.

39. In his left hand he was holding the water pot and in his right he had an excellent staff. He had matted hair of tawny colour and shone like a mass of splendour.

40. Immediately after birth the brilliant sage spoke to his mother, "O mother, go as you please and I also go at my will."

41. "O mother, whenever you have some work, whenever you desire in your mind, please remember me. Immediately I shall come to you to fulfil your desire."

42. After saying this and worshipping his mother’s feet the sage, a storehouse of penance, went away to perform penance to holy centres quelling sins.

43. She too returned to her father. The chaste lady was overwhelmed by her love for her son. She recollected his activities and described the event as her great fortune.

44. As the boy was born in an island he was known as Dvaipayana. Since he classified the various branches of the Vedas he is glorified as Vedavyasa.

58-59. After worshipping devoutly Visvcsa and other Lirigas he began to think frequently—“What is that Linga that bestows Siddhi instantaneously and worshipping whom the great god, we shall be able to attain all lores and by whose blessings I may have the power to compose the Puranas.

60-73. There are crores of Lirigas; from the midst of these what shall I instal, what shall I resort so? Can it be Onkaranatha, or KrttivaseSvara or KedareSa, or Kame&#x26;a, or Candresa, or Trilocana, or Kalesa, or Vrddhakalesa, or Kalasesvara, or Jycsthesa, or Jambukesa, or Jaigisavyesvara, or Dasasvamedhesana, or Drumacandesa, or Drkkesa or Garudesa or Gancsvara, or Prasannavadanesa, or Dharmesa, or Tarakesvara or Nandikesa or Nivase<a, or="" patrlsa,="" priti-kesvara,="" parvatesa,="" pasupati,="" ha^akesvara="" brhaspatlsvara,="" tilabhandesa="" bharabhutesvara,="" mahajaksmisvara="" marute£a,="" moksesa,="" ganges.,="" narmadesvara,="" krsnesa,="" paramesana,="" ratnesvara,="" yamunesa,="" langalisa,="" vi^vesvara="" avimuktesvara,="" vi§alaksl£a,="" vyaghresvara,="" varahesa,="" vidyesvara="" varunesa,="" vidhisa,="" hankesesvara,="" bhavanisa,="" kapardisa,="" kanduke^a="" ajesvara="" visvakarmcsvara,="" vlresvara,="" nadesa,="" kapilesa,="" bhuvanesvara,="" vaskulisa="" mahadeva,="" siddhisvara="" visvedevesvara="" virabhadresa="" bhairavesvara,="" amrtesa;="" satina="" parvatisvara="" siddhe§vara,="" matangesa="" bhutisvara,="" asa&#x3C;j-hisa,="" prakasesa,="" kotirudresvara,="" madalasesvara,="" tilaparnesvara,="" hiranyagarbhesa="" shall="" it="" be="" madhyamesvara?”&#x3C;="" p="">
</a,>
74. Pondering thus, Vyasa, devoted to Siva with his mind steady in meditation, thought for a short while.

75-77. “O I remember it now. I had forgotten it before. My desire has been realised. There is a Linga which is worshipped by the Siddhas. It bestows virtue, love, wealth and salvation. Its sight and touch purifies the mind. It opens the door to heaven. It is in the great holy centre,

the holy centre of the Siddhas, in Avimukta. There is the great Linga Madhyamesvara by name.

78. There is no other Linga at Ka£I than Madhyamesvara for the sight of which the gods come here on every festive occasion.

79. Hence lord Madhyamesvara shall be resorted to. Many brahmins have attained Siddhis by propitiating Him.

80. Siva is called Madhyamesvara since he is stationed mainly in the centre of KaSI for bestowing happiness on the people.

81. It is by worshipping this deity that the Gandharva Tumburu and the celestial sage Narada became proficient in the art of music.

82. It is by propitiating Him that Visnu acquired the art of bestowing salvation; and Brahma, Visnu and Rudra became the creator, sustainer and the annihilator respectively.

83. Kubera became the lord of wealth; Vamadeva the head of the devotees of Siva; the childless Kha{vanga was blessed with children.

84. The celestial damsel Candrabhama of cuckoo-like sweet voice was merged into the Linga even as she was dancing emotionally.

85. Srlkara, son of the cowherdess, resorted to Madhyamesvara and attained the chieftainship nf the Ganas of the benevolent Siva.

86. Thanks to the favour of Madhyamesvara the two gods Sukra and Brhaspati honoured and respected by the Asuras and gods became the master of all lore.

87. I too shall worship lord Madhyamesvara and attain the power to compose the Puranas immediately.

88. After resolving thus the sage Vyasa, son of Satyavali, took his bath in the waters of the Ganga and performed the sacred rites and observances.

89. Sometimes he took in only leaves, sometimes he lived on fruit and vegetable diet, sometimes on wind or water and sometimes he observed complete fast and performed the sacred rites.

90. Thus by these observances of restraints the holy

1634 Sivapur&#x26;na sage worshipped Madhyamesvara thrice a day with flowers of various trees.

91. A long time elapsed thus. One day early in the morning the sage was returning after his bath in the waters of the Ganga.

92. The holy sage saw lord Madhyamesvara, the bestower of desires of the devotees, in the midst of the Linga.

93. His left side was adorned by Uma. He was wearing the hide of a tiger as his upper cloth. His body appeared beautiful with the surging waves of the Ganga amidst his matted hair.

94. The moonlight of the autumnal crescent moon forming bright patches in his forelocks. Bhasma was smeared all over his body. His body was as white as camphor or the Arjuna tree.

95. He had assumed the form of a five-year-old boy with eyes extending up to his ears. His lips were as red as the coral. He was wearing ornaments befitting a boy.

96. The lustre of his body subdued the arrogance of a crore Cupids. He was naked. His lotus-face was beaming with smiles. He was sportively singing Saman hymns.

97-98. On seeing Siva, the lord of Uma, the shoreless ocean of mercy, known for his fondness of devotees and easily propitiated with delighted pleasing face, inaccessible even to the Yogins, the kinsman of the distressed and the Cit-formed lord, the sage sang the song of prayer with words choked with devotion.

Vyasa said :

99. “O lord of gods, O fortunate one who are favourably disposed to the refugees, O lord inaccessible to words, mind and activities, and the one that are invisible even to the Yogins. O Uma, Vedas do not realise our greatness.

100. You alone are the creator of the universe, me sustainer and the annihilator too.

101. You are the first and foremost of all gods. You

are the existence, knowledge and bliss. You have no name or family lineage. O SadaSiva you are omniscient.

# 102.

You alone are the great Brahman; the untier of the knot of Maya, unsullied by the three attributes as the leaf of the lotus unaffected by water.

# 103.

You have neither birth nor conduct of life. You have neither a native land nor a family. Even so you are the lord of the three worlds. You fulfil the desires of the three worlds.

# 104.

Neither Brahma nor Visnu nor the gods including Indra nor the leading Yogins know your reality. We worship you of such features.

# 105.

Everything originates from you. You are all the lord of Gaurl, the slayer of the Tripuras, a boy, a youth, an aged man. I unite you with my heart.

# 106.

Obeisance to lord Siva, who deserves the worship of devotees, Obeisance to the Ancient Being; to Siva the great Atman.

# 107.

After eulogising thus when the sage Vyasa prostrated on the ground the delighted boy spoke to him.

# 108.

O Yogin, choose your boon, whatever be in your mind. There is nothing which cannot be granted to you since I am subservient to my devotees.

Then the sage Vyasa of great penance stood up and replied “O lord what is hidden from you the omniscient?”

# 109.

You are the immanent Soul and bestower of everything. Why does the lord force me for begging which is the cause of misery?

# 110.

On hearing these words of Vyasa of pious mind, lord Siva who had assumed the form of boy smiled and said:-- The boy said O: most excellent of those who adore Brahman,

# 111.

the desire you have cherished in your heart will undoubtedly be realised ere long.

# 112.

I the immanent lord shall station myself in your throat, O brahmin, and shall make you compose the Itihasa and the Puranas efficiently.

of Desire) that you uttered now shall fulfil the desires of men who read or recite it in Siva’s temple thrice a day for a year.

115. The recital of this hymn is conducive to the increase of learning and intellect. It is the cause of all riches and the bestower of virtue and salvation to men.

116. Even a fool, getting up early in the morning taking his bath, worshipping the linga of Siva and reciting this hymn for a year shall attain the status of Bfhaspati (preceptor of the gods).

117. This hymn repeatedly recited for a year in the presence of the Linga whether by a woman or a man, duly observing restraints, shall increase the intellect and learning.

118. After saying this the boy Siva merged himself into the Linga. Shedding tears of love, Vyasa was overcome with emotions.

119. Vyasa who thus secured the boon from the great lord Madhyamesvara composed the eighteen Puranas sportively.

120-122. The eighteen Puranas Brahma, Padma, Vaisnava, Saiva, Bhagavata, Bhavisya, Naradlya, Markandeya, Agneya, Brahmavaivarta, Linga, Varaha, Vamana, Kaurma, Matsya, Garuda, Skanda and Brahmanda are conducive to fame and merit to those who listen to the glory of Siva.

Suta said: You have enumerated the eighteen Puranas. O foremost among the knowers of the Vedas please define them now.

124. This selfsame question was put to Nandi’keSvara by Tandi the Brahminical Yogin. I shall tell you what he had said.

Nandikeivara said:

125. O Tandi, Brahma the four-faced deity is the main speaker. Hence, O sage, the first Purana is called Brahma.

# 126.

The second Purana is called Padma. It is so called because it mentions the greatness of the Padmakalpa.

# 127.

Another Purana composed by ParaSara and enlightening the details of Visnu is called Vaisnava Purana. It is said to be composed by Vyasa since there is no difference between father and son.

# 128.

Those who know the Puranas speak that purana as Siva Purana wherein there are many stories of Siva in its earlier and later forms.

# 129.

Where the stories of the goddess Durga are mentioned, it is said to be Bhagavata Purana as well as Devipurana.76

# 130-131.

The Purana narrated by Narada is called Naradiya. The seventh Purana is called Tancji, Markandeya because the great sage Markandeya is the speaker therein. Since it is related to the fire-god, the Purana is called Agneya. Since it recounts future events the Purana is called the Bhavi$ya Purana.

# 132.

Since the transformation of Brahman is narrated the Purana is called Brahmavaivarta. Since the story of Linga is mentioned it is called Linga Purana.

# 133-135.

O sage, the twelfth Purana Varaha is so called because it contains the story of Varaha, the great Boar. In the Skanda Purana the speaker is lord Siva himself and the listener is Skanda. In the Vamana Purana the story of Vamana (the Dwarf-god) is mentioned. The Kurma Purana contains the story of Kurma (the tortoise-god). The Matsya Purana is so called because it is expounded by Matsya. The Garuda Purana is so called because the speaker is Garuda himself. Since the story of the entire cosmic egg is mentioned, the last Purana is called Brahman^a Purana.

# Sula said:

This question was put by me to the intelligent Vyasa. From him the definitions of the Puranas were heard by me.

He composed the excellent Mahabharata and the Purina Samhitas. O brahmin, you shall not entertain a doubt as to why Satyavati had sexual intercourse with ParaSara and Santanu.

This wondrous birth has sufficient reasons behind it. In the story of great men the good qualities shall be grasped by the intelligent people.

He who reads or listens to this great secret is rid of all sins and is honoured in the world of sages.

# CHAPTER FORTYFIVE₇₇

# (The incarnation of Mahdkdlikd)

The sages said: —

1. The beautiful episode of Siva with various incidental anecdotes and narratives of various incarnations, is heard. It yields both worldly pleasures and salvation to men.
2. O foremost among those who know Brahman, we wish to hear from you the beautiful story of the mother of the universe, the goddess.
3. The first primordial Sakti of Siva the great Brahman, who is called Uma, is the great mother of the three worlds.
4. Her two incarnations Sati and Haimavati, have been heard, O intelligent Suta. Please mention her other incarnations too.
5. Which intelligent man will be reluctant to hear the good attributes of the glorious mother? Wise men never abandon them.

Suta said:

You are all blessed and contented noble souls in as

much as you inquire about the great story of Uma, the great mother.

# 7.

Sages consider the dust-particles of the feet of those who listen, narrate and inquire about it, on a par with holy centres.

# 8.

Blessed and contented are they, their parents and their family, whose mind is merged in the goddess, the great Knowledge.

# 9.

Those who do not eulogise the goddess of the gods, the cause of all causes are deluded by the attributes of Maya. They are unfortunate. There is no doubt in this.

# 10.

Those who do not worship the great goddess, the ocean of the juice of mercy, fall in the blind well in the form of the cruel worldly existence.

# 11.

Abandoning the goddess and resorting to another deity is as bad as abandoning the Ganga and resorting to water in the desert for the sake of satisfaction.

# 12.

Which excellent man will abandon her whose very remembrance bestows all the four aims of life without any strain?

# 13.

This same question was put to Medhas by the noble Suratha. Please listen. I shall narrate what was mentioned by Medhas.

# 14.

Formerly in the Svarocisa Manvantara there was a king Viratha. Suratha his son was of great strength and exploit.

# 15.

He was very munificent, truthful, efficient in duties, a devotee of the goddess, an ocean of kindness and the protector of his subjects.

# 16.

While he was thus ruling over the earth, with the brilliance of Indra, nine other kings became desirous of seizing his land.

# 17.

They laid siege to his capital Kola. The king had a terrible war with them.

# 18.

That king was defeated by his powerful enemies in the war. His kingdom was seized and he was banished from his city Kola.

78. Koli is identical with the modern Kolhapur in the Maharashtra State.

19. The king went to another city of his along with his ministers. There too he was defeated by his enemies who had a large following.

20. His ministers and officers became inimical to him due to adverse fate. They took away all the wealth from the treasury.

21. The king left his city pretending to go out for hunting. Alone he got up on a horse and went to the dense forest.

22-23. Going about here and there, the king saw the hermitage of a great sage. It was shining all round with flower gardens. Everywhere the sound of Vedic hymns was heard. All the animals there were quiet and peaceful. The disciples and the disciples of their disciples moved here and there.

24. O intelligent one, tigers and other ferocious and powerful animals did not harass the animals of less strength in that hermitage, thanks to the power of the leading brahmin.

25. The king who was very kind and learned was welcomed and honoured by the leading sage with pleasing words, accommodation and food and stayed there.

26-27. Once the king began to think anxiously “Alas, my kingdom has been seized by my haughty enemies. I am unfortunate. My intellect is confounded. I have lost my splendour. The kingdom which had been well guarded by my ancestors is now enjoyed by my enemies.

28. There was no king in this family as weak as I. What shall I do? Where shall I go? How shall I get the kingdom back?

29. My hereditary ministers and counsellors have left me. I do not know which king they serve now.

30-32. I do not know what plight they are in, after the ruination of the kingdom. My heroic soldiers, very enthusiastic in the battle, slayers of enemies, now serve another king. Huge elephants like mountains, horses fast as wind have gone away. Is the traditional treasury accumulated by my ancestors well guarded or not? Thus the very virtuous king became much deluded.

Umdsamhitd 1641

33-35. In the meantime came a certain Vaiṣya there. The king asked him, “Sir, who are you? Why have you come here? Why do you appear to be very morose and dejected? Please tell me this, now.”

On hearing the sweet words of the king, the leading Vaiṣya Samadhi shed tears. He spoke to the king in words full of humility and friendship.

The Vaiṣya said:

36-38. “O king, I am a Vaiṣya Samadhi, born of a rich family. Out of greed for my wealth I have been abandoned by my wife, sons and others. I am depressed by my past Karman. O king, I have come here to the forest. I am worried about my sons, grandsons, wife, brothers, their sons and friends. O lord, ocean of mercy, I am in dark about their welfare.”

The king said:

39. “How is it that you love, even as senseless animals do, those sons and others who are of evil conduct and covetous for wealth and by whom you have been ousted?”

The Vaiṣya said:

40. “O king, words pregnant with substantial sense have been uttered by you. Still my mind is deluded by the tie of love.”

O the king and the Vaiṣya, both excellent sage, of them equally deluded then approached the sage Medhas.

41. The valorous king accompanied by the chief of the Vaiṣyas bowed his head to the leading Yogin.

42. With palms joined in reverence the king spoke to the sage: “O holy lord, it behoves you now to dispel our delusion.”

43. Abandoned by the royal glory I have resorted to this dense forest. Still I am not content and happy since my kingdom has been taken away.

44. This Vaiṣya has been expelled from his house by his people, wife and others. Still his sense of affinity and kinship with them does not go off.

46. What is the reason hereof? Please say. Wise though are, our minds are afflicted and agitated by delusion. This is great foolishness.

The sage said:

The king said:

51. O sage, who is that Goddess? Who is that great Maya who fascinates all? How was that goddess born? Please tell me.

The sage said:

52-53. When the whole universe had been one great expanse of water, a vast sea, when Kcsava, the king of Yogins, resorted to Yogic slumber and was sleeping on Sesa, two Asuras were born of the dirt in the ears of Visnu. They became notorious on the surface of the world in the names of Madhu and Kaitabha.

54. They were terrible with huge bodies. They had the dazzling brilliance of the sun at the time of dissolution. They had huge jaw bones. Their faces were hideous with curved fangs. They seemed to devour all the worlds.

55. On seeing the lotus-seated deity in the umbilical lotus80 of the lord, the two Asuras81 shouted “Hey, who are you?” and attempted to kill him.

56. On seeing the two Daityas and observing that Visnu was still lying in the vast milky ocean,82 Brahma eulogised ParameSvari. Brahma said:

57. O Mahamaya, save me, save me, O goddess favourably disposed to those who seek refuge in you, mother of the universe, save me from these Daityas of hideous features.

58-59. I bow to the great Maya, the Yogic slumber, Uma, Sati, Kalaratri, Maharatri, Moharatri, greater than the greatest, the mother of the three deities, the eternal, the bestower of the fruits of the cherished desires of the devotees, the protectress of the gods and the ocean of mercy.

60. It is by your power that Brahma creates the world, Visnu protects it and Siva destroys it at the opportune time.

61. O Mother, you are Svaha, Svadha, Hri, the unalloyed intellect, Tu$ti (satisfaction), Pustf (nourishment), Santi (peace), K$anti (forbearance), Ksudha (hunger) and mercy itself.

62. O mother, you are the Maya of Vi§nu, the very consciousness, the great Sakti, Lajja (bashfulness) and Tf?na (thirst).

63. You are Bhranti (Illusion). You appear in the form of Smrti (Memory): you stay assuming the form of mother. You are Laksmi in the house of those who engage themselves in meritorious activities.

77. Although free from aberrations, and devoid of forms and features, goddess Uma manifested herself in different Yugas for the destruction of the distress of the gods, after assuming different forms and features.

78. Thus I have described to you her manifestation in bodily form whose wish alone manifests as everything efficaciously. Thus she conducts her sports in that way and thereby gives chance to her devotees to describe her attributes.

# CHAPTER FORTYSIX

# {Incarnation of Mahalak?mi}

The sage said:

1. There was a demon Rambha who was the crest-jewel of the race of Daityas. From him was born Mahisa83 the Danava of great splendour.

2. That king of Danavas defeated all the gods in battle and ruled over the kingdom of heaven seated on the throne of lord Indra.

3. The defeated gods sought refuge in Brahma. With them Brahma went to the place where Visnu and Siva84 were present.

4. After reaching there and bowing to Siva and Vi§nu the gods narrated all their woeful tale in the proper order.

5. O lords, we are harassed by the wicked Mahisa. We have been ousted from heaven after our defeat in the battle-field.

out peace or happiness anywhere. O what pitiable plights we —Indra and others —have been led to!

7-8. The sinful Asura who has offered freedom from fear to the partisans of the Daityas, himself performs the ordained task of these —viz, the sun, the moon, Varuna, Kubera, Yama, Indra, Agni, wind, the Gandharvas, Vidyadharas and the good Caranas and others as well.

9. Hence it behoves you to save us the gods who have sought refuge in you. O lords, please think of the means of killing him immediately.

10. On hearing the gods, Visnu and Siva were very angry. Their eyes rolled through anger.

11. Then a great splendour issued forth from the mouths of the infuriated Visnu and Siva and from the bodies of other gods.

12. The gods who were devoted to meditation on Durga saw the mass of splendour blazing in all the ten directions.

13. That highly terrible splendour issuing forth from the bodies of the gods joined together and became a woman MahisamardinI herself.

14. Her dazzlingly brilliant face constituted the splendour of Siva, the hairs the splendour of Yama and the arms the splendour of Visnu.

15-18. Her breasts were formulated by the splendour of the moon; the waist by that of Indra; the calves and thighs by that of Varuna; the hips by that of the earth; the feet by that of Brahma; the toes by that of the sun; the fingers by that of Indra; the nose by that of Kubera; the teeth by that of the patriarch; the eyes by that of fire; the eyebrows by that of the dusk; the ears by that of the wind, her other limbs by that of other heaven-dwellers. Thus the goddess manifested herself on the lotus-seat.

19. On seeing her thus formulated by the mass of splendour of the gods, they attained great delight.

20. Observing that she had no weapons, Brahma and other gods decided to make her fully equipped with weapons.

# UmSsamhita

# 21.

Then lord Siva offered her a spear; Lord Krsna gave her a discus; Varuna conch and noose.

# 22-23.

The fire-god gave her Sakti; the wind-god a quiver full of arrows; Indra the thunderbolt and a bell; Yama a big staff; Prajapati a garland of beads; Brahma a water-pot and the sun the lustrous hair.

# 24-27.

Kala gave her a sword and a shining shield, the milk ocean a beautiful necklace, two fresh pieces of cloth, the crest-jewel, ear-rings, bangles, crescent-shaped ornaments, beautiful anklets, shoulder-pieces, a necklace and finger-rings. Visvakarman gave her a beautiful axe and the ocean various weapons, an impenetrable armour, a beautiful garland and a lotus.

# 28-29.

Himavat gave her a lion and gems of various sorts. Kubera a vessel filled with wine. Sesa a NagahSra of wonderful workmanship, studded with various precious gems.

# 30.

Thus honoured, the goddesss with these and other similar objects, ornaments, weapons etc. shouted loudly again and again.

# 31.

The sky was filled with her terrible noise that echoed tremendously and made the three worlds agitated.

# 32.

The four oceans shook and rolled. The earth quaked. Cries of victory were shouted by the gods harassed by Mahisa.

# 33.

Then the gods eulogised the great Sakti, Ambika in the form of Mahalaksmi with words choked with devotion.

# 34.

On seeing the world agitated, the enemies of the gods got up with uplifted arms and with their armies ready for war.

# 35.

The infuriated Mahisa rushed at the direction of the sound and saw the goddess who had pervaded the three worlds with her beautiful lustre.

# 36.

In the meantime, crores of great heroes led by Mahisasura came there with weapons.

# 37-38.

Ciksura, Camara, Udagra, Karala, Uddha^a, Ba?kala; Tamra, Ugrasya, Ugravlrya, Bidala, Andhaka, Durdhara, Durmukha, Trinetra Mahahanu— these and many others, heroic and efficient in battle, came there.

fought with the goddess in the battle a terribly long time elapsed.

40. Different weapons and missiles hurled by the hosts of enemies were rendered futile instantaneously by the power of the goddess.

41. Then the goddess hit and struck the hosts of enemies Cik$ura and others with her club, arrows, spear, &#x26;akti and axe.

42. When his armies fell the demon Mahisa struggled with the hosts of soldiers that issued from the breath of the goddess.

43. He kicked some with the hoofs, hit some with the horns and others with his tail and snout.

44. After slaying the Ganas the chief of Asuras rushed at the lion of the goddess in order to kill it. Then she became wrathful.

45. He of great virility thrashed the ground with his hoofs, uprooted a mountain with his horns, hurled it and shouted. O excellent king, heavy mountains hurled by him as he rushed all round fell in the battle-ground from the sky.

46. Clouds split by his horns were shattered to pieces. The ocean struck at with his tail throbbed and splashed water beyond the shores all round.

47. On seeing the demon Mahisa thus infuriated, Ambika, the protectress of the gods, became ready to kill him.

48. She took up a noose and hurled it at him. She bound the Asura Mahisa. Then the demon abandoned his assumed guise.

49. Wielding Maya, he became a lion. Soon as Ambika tried to cut off his head he became armed with a sword.

50. She then struck him with the arrows, as he stood there with the sword and shield. He then became an elephant and struck at the lion with his trunk.

51. The goddess cut off his hand with her sword. The demon then assumed his original form.

# 53.

He then agitated three worlds including the mobile and immobile beings. Then, Candika of great honour and exploit became infuriated.

# 54.

She drank the beverage again and again. With eyes rolling she laughed aloud. The haughty Asura too, proud of his strength and exploit, roared.

# 55.

He uprooted the mountains and hurled them at her. She too reduced them to powder and struck them with arrows.

# 56.

With her face reddened as a result of the inebriation after drinking wine, and with her senses excited, she spoke in a tone as majestic as the rumbling of the clouds. The goddess said:

# 57.

“O stupid fellow, demon of ruined intellect, are you stubborn in vain? None of the Asuras in the three worlds can stand before me.”

# 58.

Thus saying the goddess pounced on him, stamped on his neck and pierced him with her fierce spear.

# 59.

Pressed with her foot and overwhelmed by her might the Asura seemed as good as half dead.

# 60.

Still he continued to fight. His head was cut off with the sword and he was felled down on the ground.

# 61.

Crying “Alas Alas” loudly, his followers, afraid of the battle fled from the scene! shouting “Save us, O save us”.

# 62.

The god Indra and others, eulogised the goddess. The Gandharvas sang songs; the celestial damsels danced.

# 63.

O king, thus the origin of Mahalakshmi has been narrated to you. Now listen to the origin of Sarasvati with a calm mind.

The sage said:

1. There was a Daitya Sumbha and another equally powerful Nisumbha. The three worlds including mobile and immobile beings were attacked by the two brothers.
2. The gods afflicted and harassed by them went to Himalaya and saluted the mother of all living beings, the bestower of all desires.

The gods said:

O goddess Durga, Victory be to you. O, beloved of your kinsmen, be victorious. Obeisance to you, the cause of the protection of the three worlds.
Obeisance to you, the bestower of salvation, obeisance to the great mother, the cause of the creation, sustenance and annihilation of the world.
O goddess of the form of Kalika, Tara, Chinnamasta, Sri Vidya, Obeisance to you.
O goddess of the worlds, of the form of Bhairava, obeisance to you. Obeisance to Bagalamukhi (stork-faced). Obeisance to Dhumavati.
Obeisance to Tripurasundari, to MatarigI, to Ajita (the unconquered) and to Vijaya.
Obeisance to Jaya, Marigala Vilasini, to you of the form of milking maid and of terrible form.
Obeisance to you, O goddess, of the form of the unconquered, of permanent form, the protectress of those who seek refuge in you.
Obeisance to the one knowable through Vedanta; obeisance to you the great soul, the heroine of infinite worlds of this universe.

Eulogised thus by the gods, the delighted goddess spoke:

“Who is being eulogised by you here?”

Then a virgin came out of the body of the goddess. Even as they were winking she spoke to the goddess with great reverence.

“O mother, this eulogy is addressed to me by the heaven-dwellers harassed by the powerful Daityas Sumbha and Nisumbha.”

# 14.

Since she emerged out of the inner vestures of her body she is called KauSikl. The destroyer of the Asura Sumbha is being sung in that name.

# 15.

She alone is said to be Ugratarika and great Ugratarika. She is called Matangi after the source from which she manifested herself.

# 16.

She addressed the gods “All of you stay here fearlessly. I shall carry out your task without any strain. I am independent”.

# 17.

After saying this, the goddess vanished. Canda and Munda— the attendants of Sumbha and Nisumba saw the goddess.

# 18.

On seeing her beautiful form pleasing to the eyes they were fascinated. They lost their consciousness and fell on the ground.

# 19.

Returning to their king they narrated the details to him “O king, a certain beautiful lady hitherto unseen has been seen by us.

# 20.

Seated on a lion, on the beautiful peak of the Himavat she was served by the virgins of the gods with palms joined in reverence.

# 21.

They massaged her feet and hands, decorated her tresses, and applied collyrium to her eyes.

# 22.

A certain damsel held out the mirror to her face. Another handed over the betel-leaf along with cloves and cardamom.

# 23.

Some picked up the fallen dice and stood in front of her. Some bedecked her body with ornaments and clothes.

# 24.

Her calves and thighs are like the stem of the plantain tree. Her nose is like that of a parrot. Her arms are like serpents and creepers. She wears a beautiful girdle. The anklets round her feet are jingling.

# 25.

Pearl necklaces heave over her breasts rendered fragrant with the musk. Necklaces shine round her neck. She was sporting about bedecked in chaplets.

# 26.

She has semi-circular marks on her forehead. She wears ear-rings set with gems. Her plaited hair are pretty. The wide three eyes bedeck her face.

# 27.

She is imperishable, possessed of garlands. Bangles shine in her hands. There are gold rings round her fingers. Shining bracelets make her hands dazzle.

# 28.

She is clad in white garments. She shines in her lotus-pose with the marks of saffron on her forehead which is also bedecked with the moon.

# 29.

She has the brilliance of lightning. She wears precious garments. Her breasts are elevated within her bodice. She holds excellent weapons with her eight uplifted arms.

# 30.

There is no lady among the Asuras, Nagas, Gandharvas or Danavas in the three worlds as beautiful as she.

# 31.

Hence the fitness for sexual indulgence with her rests only in you since she is a gem among ladies and O lord, you are a gem among men.

# 32.

On hearing the words of Canda and Munda that great demon Sumbha sent a messenger Sugriva to her.

# 33.

“O messenger, there is a certain beautiful lady on the snow-capped mountain. Mentioning these words of mine she shall be strenuously brought here.”

# 34.

Thus urged by him, the excellent Danava Sugriva went to Himacala and spoke to the great goddess, the mother of the universe. The messenger said:

# 35.

O gentle lady, the Daitya Sumbha and his brother Nisumbha are very strong and valorous. They are famous in the three worlds.

# 36.

O goddess, I am a messenger of Sumbha. I have come with his message to which you will listen please.

# 37.

“I have defeated Indra and others in the battle and taken away their jewels. I enjoy the share of the gods offered to them in the sacrifices.

# 38.

You are a jewel among women, more precious than ether jewels. Resort to me or to my younger brother, exhibiting your loving emotion.

39. On hearing the message of Sumbha conveyed by the messenger the Mahamaya, the beloved consort of Siva, spoke.

The goddess said:

40-41. C) messenger, you speak the truth, not the lie. But I have taken a vow that I shall endeavour to make one alone as my husband who can shake off my pride, who can conquer me in the battle. None else.

42. Hence you convey my words to Sumbha and NHumbha. Let either do whatever is proper in this matter.

43. On hearing these words of the goddess the Asura Sugriva returned to his king and acquainted him with every detail.

On hearing the report of the messenger Sumbha of stern rule angrily said to Dhumraksa, the foremost of his generals. O Dhumraksa, a lady on there is beautiful the snow-capped Himalaya mountain. Go quickly and fetch her here. O excellent Asura, do not be afraid of this expedition. If she wishes to fight, you shall fight strenuously.

47. Thus directed the Daitya Dhumraksa went to Himalaya and spoke to the goddess who was a part of Uma.

48. “O lady, approach my lord. Otherwise I shall kill you. I am accompanied by sixty thousand Asuras”

The goddess said:

49. “O hero, you are commissioned by the king of Daityas. If you kill me what can I do for you? But I consider it impossible to go without a fight.”

50. Thus addressed, the Danava Dhumraksa rushed at her but was burnt with a mere Hunkara uttered by her.

51. Since then, that goddess is called Dhfimavati in the world. When propitiated she destroys hosts of enemies of her devotees.

52. After Dhumraksa was killed, his army was crunched and munched by the infuriated lion. Those who were spared fled away.

53. On hearing that the Daitya was killed by the goddess, the valorous Sumbha was angry and bit his lips.

# 54.

He sent the Asuras-Cantja, Munda and Raktablja in order. The Daityas, thus ordered, went to the spot where Ambika was stationed.

# 55.

On seeing the goddess seated on a lion, possessed of Anima and other Siddhis and dazzling the quarters with her brilliance, the leading Danavas said.

# 56.

“O lady, hasten to approach Sumbha and Ni£umbha. Otherwise we shall kill you along with your Ganas and your lion.

# 57.

O lady, choose him as your husband. He is eulogised by the guardians of the quarters and others. You will attain a great bliss rare to attain by the gods.”

# 58.

On hearing these words the goddess Amba smiled and spoke interesting and truthful words.

# 59.

Lord Siva, the great Brahman, the eternal god is without a second. Even the Vedas do not understand his reality. What then of Visnu and others?

# 60.

I am His subtle Prakrti. How can I choose another as my husband? Even if she is overwhelmed by love does a lioness choose a jackal as her mate?

# 61.

A female elephant does not take an ass nor does a leopardess take a hare. O Daityas, overcome by the Serpent of Death you speak in vain.

# 62.

Descend to Patala all of you. If you have the power, fight.” On hearing her provocative words the Asuras said to one another.

# 63.

“We do not kill you as you are a woman. But if you desire for battle be ready with your lion.”

# 64.

While they spoke thus the fight ensued. The arrows rained in the battle, sharp arrows from either side.

# 65.

Thus fighting with them sportively the goddess slew the Asura along with Canda and Munda.

# 66.

Though they had an inimical feeling these enemies of the gods attained in the end that world which her followers go to.

1. O holy lord, O brahmin, what did Sumbha, the suppressor of the gods, do on hearing that Dhumrak$a, Cancja and Raktabija were killed by the goddess? Please tell me this now. I desire to hear the purifying tale of the goddess, the cause of the universe.

The sage said:

O king, on hearing that the leading Daityas had been killed, the great Asura of commendable valour ordered his invincible followers who were thrilled at the very mention of the war.
At my behest the Daityas born of the race of Kalaka87 have all assembled here with their armies and along with Kalakeyas88, Mauryas89, Daurhrdas90 and others. Let them march on with hopes of victory.
After ordering the demons, Sumbha and Nisumbha mounted on their chariots and set out. Their armies too followed them like swarms of moths rising up from a mountain definitely for their destruction.
Mrdangas, Mardalas, Bherikas, Dindimas, Jliarjharas and Anakas were sounded. The warmongers rejoiced in the battle-ground. Those who were afraid fled away for their life.
Clad in their martial dress the soldiers came in their healthy spirits to the battleground. Holding various weapons and missiles they teased one another each eager for his victory.
Soldiers on elephants looked at the enemy with

MB. 87. In respect of this H mse no details are available either from the or the Purai-a.

88. Kalakeyas, descendants of Kalaka wife of Kasyapa, are often mentioned as powerful demons in the MB. and the Puranas.

89. Mauryas are the descendants of the Asura Mura who is generally mentioned in connection with Pi£gjyoti>a.

90. Daurhrdas are the descendants of the Asura Durhfda.

Indifference. In the company of the lord of Asuras they rejoiced in the battle.

9. The sound arising from the guns rose up repeatedly making the gods tremble. A great darkness enveloped the sky. Even the chariot of the sun was not visible.

10. Foot-soldiers set out in excessive numbers desirous of victory. Soldiers in chariots, on horsebacks, elephants and others set out joyously in crores and crores.

11. The rutting elephants like massive black mountains spread their trumpeting sound in the battle-field. Camels resembling small hills produced hoarse sounds from their throats.

12. Neighing horses hailing from exalted lands, with big ornaments round their necks, expert in the knowledge of their gaits planted their legs on the heads of elephants and flew like birds.

13. On seeing the army of the enemy advancing thus, Ambika kept her bow well-strung. She sounded her bell that distressed the enemy. The lion too shook his manes and roared.

14. Seeing her bedecked in fine ornaments, holding weapons and stationed on the Himalaya mountain Nisumbha spoke words full of sentiments like a man clever in understanding the emotions of beautiful women.

15. “Even a petal of the Malati (Jasmine) flower thrown on the beautiful body of women like you may distress you. O goddess, how will you carry on a terrible war with the self-same handsome body of yours?”

After saying thus the great Asura became silent.

16. Cancjika spoke to him—“O foolish Asura, why do you prattle in vain? Either fight or else return to Patala.

17. The heroic demon, becoming infuriated, made a wonderful shower of arrows on the battle-field just as masses of clouds shower water during rains.

18. Along with his arrogant followers the demon fought with sharp weapons as spears, axes, iron clubs.

91. It is the lowermost of the nether regions where V&#x26;suki reigns over the N£gas.

parighas, bows, Bhusundikas, javelins, horseshoe-edged arrows and great swords.

19. In that war great elephants looking like black mountains with foreheads pierced ran here and there. The banners of Sumbha and Nisumbha white like flying cranes fluttered here and there.

20. The demons were shattered by Kalika like fishes. The dreadful horses were beheaded and killed in the battle. The other demons were devoured by the lion.

21. In the battlefield streams of blood flowed. The dead soldiers floated. Their tresses of hair resembled the moss. Their upper cloths resembled the white foam.

22. A great fight ensued where soldiers of equal rank fought with one another. The cavalrymen fought their counterpart; the elephant-riders with those on elephants: the charioteers with those on chariots and the footsoldiers with footsoldiers.

23. Then Nisumbha thought to himself terrible period has set in now. Even a poor man may become rich and rich man poor if the time is adverse.

24. A senseless fellow may become intelligent and an intelligent man dull. A wicked man may be praised by the noble. The great and the powerful may be vanquished. The weak may come out victorious in the war.

25. Victory or defeat come naturally at the stance of the lord. Neither Siva nor Brahma nor Visnu has been able to transgress his law.

26. Heroes do not come to the battlefield for turning back. But how can I attain victory in a battle with this lady who has destroyed my entire host?

27. Indeed this lady is the ancient Prakrti, the great Siva come here to achieve the task of the gods and harass the army of the Daityas. She can never be an ordinary woman.

28. It is inglorious to be killed by a woman or to kill a woman for those who desire to taste the pleasures of war. Still how shall we show our faces to the king of Asuras without fighting?

29. After thinking thus and sitting in a great chariot

driven by a charioteer he hastened to the spot where the lady consort of Siva was present; the goddess whose youth was sought after by the celestial damsels.

# 30.

He addressed her thus —“O goddess of what avail is it if the mercenary soldiers are killed? If you desire to fight, let both of us clad in martial dress fight with each other.

# 31.

The goddess addressed KMl then—“See the foolish ambition of the two Asuras. Time the instigator of good and bad actions renders the mind work in a different way when adversity is imminent.”

# 32.

Then Nisumbha attacked Candika as well as Kali with thousands of arrows. With the volleys of her arrows Siva split into a thousand pieces the arrows discharged by the Asura.

# 33.

He then lifted up his lustrous sword along with the shield and struck the lion on its head. With her great sword she split it too as the woodcutters do to a tree with the axe.

# 34.

When the sword was split he thrust an arrow into her chest. The arrow too was cut. He then hurled the trident which powdered it with her fist.

# 35.

Prepared to die the heroic Asura seized a mace and rushed at her. She reduced the mace into powder with the edge of her trident. The demon shattered the trident with another mace.

# 36.

Then she struck Nisumbha with her sharp, terrible serpentine poisonous arrows that were accustomed to drink the blood of Asuras and brought him down to the earth.

# 37.

When his younger brother of great honour and strength fell Sumbha was furious. The eight-armed demon seated himself in a chariot and came to the place where Siva was present.

# 38.

She blew the conch Arindama, produced unbearable bow-twang; the lion shaking its manes roared. The whole sky reverberated with the threefold round.

# 39.

Then the mother of the universe laughed boisterously making all the demons tremble with fear. The gods shouted cries of “Victory” when she challenged the Asuras in the battle.

# 40.

The king of Daityas hurled a spear of shining flames which was struck down by a meteor. Siva shattered the arrows discharged by Sumbha. He too split the arrows discharged by Siva into a thousand pieces.

# 41.

She lifted up her trident and struck the great Asura. He fell down unconscious shaking heaven and earth along with the ocean like a mountain whose wings had been chopped off by Indra. 92

# 42.

Suffering the pain arising from the trident, the powerful demon, the suppressor of the gods, created ten thousand hands and struck Kali and Candika along with the lion, by means of his discus.

# 43.

Splitting sportively the discus hurled by him, she hurt and struck the Asura with the trident. Thus both of them met their death at the lotus-hands of Siva that sanctify the universe and attained the great region.

# 44.

When the powerful Nisumbha, and Sumbha of terrible exploit were killed the Daityas entered Patala. 93

# 45.

Others were devoured by Kali’s lion. The remaining Asuras being excessively frightened fled in the quarters.

# 46.

The rivers with clear water flowed along their paths; the winds blew very gentle to the touch; the sky became clear.

# 47.

Sacrifices were revived by the gods and the sages, Lord Indra and the gods felt blissful again.

# 48-49.

O lord, this story of Uma is holy and meritorious. It describes the destruction of the king of Daityas. He who regularly reads this with faith enjoys all worldly pleasures inaccessible even to the gods and attains the abode of Uma hereafter by the very grace of the goddess.

# 50.

Thus was the goddess, slayer of Sumbha born. She is said to be Sarasvati. O king, she has manifested herself as a part of Uma.

92. See P. 643 note. Balisadman—the abode of Bali. According to legend God Visnu in the form of a Brahmin dwarf craved from Bali the boon of three steps of ground and having obtained it stepped over heaven and earth in two strides but then out of respect to Bali's devotion and his grandson Prahlada’s virtues, he stopped short and fell to him Patala, the nether region. See P. 953 note 27 1; P. 730 note 1 17.

# CHAPTER FORTYNINE

# ( The manifestation of Umd)

The sages said:

1. O Suta, the most excellent among the omniscients please mention the incarnation of Uma, the goddess of all the worlds and the mother of Sarasvati.
2. She is sung as the primordial Prakrti of the supreme Brahman. She is both possessed and devoid of forms. She is of the form of eternal bliss. She is Satl.

Suta said: O sages, listen lovingly to the great story, the perfect knowledge of which alone helps man to attain the great goal.

Once there was a clash between the gods and the Asuras. Thanks to the power of the goddess the gods became victorious.
Then the gods were proud and haughty. They boasted— “We are blessed. What can the Asuras do to us?
Of our unbearable prowess, the Asuras are afraid. They have gone to Patala saying, “Run, run”.
Then all of them proclaimed thus: “Wonderful is the strength, splendour and good luck of the gods that has reduced the race of the Daityas.
Then a mass of splendour appeared, at the unprecedented sight of which the gods were surprised.
Ignorant of the real glory and the intention of the goddess to quell their arrogance, the Asuras said with choking throats “What is this? What is this?”
Then the lord Indra ordered the gods ye all and examine it and ascertain what it is.
Urged by Indra, the wind-god approached splendour and addressed it, “Who are you?” The splendour too put the same question to him.
Thus asked by the big mass of splendour the wind-god replied arrogantly. — “I am Vayu the vital breath of the universe.”

13. Everything in the universe, mobile or immobile, is woven like warp and woof into me. I am the support of everything. I move the entire universe.

14. Then the great splendour said: "If you are competent to move, O wind-god, please move this blade of grass I have set before you. Move it as you please."

15. Then wind-god put forth all his efforts. But the blade of grass did not stir from its position. Then he was put to shame.

16. The wind-god went silently to the assembly of India. There he narrated the details of his discomfiture.

17. "False is our pride that we are the lords. In fact we are helpless, insignificant creatures."

18. Then Indra sent all the gods. When they could not realise anything Indra himself went there.

19. On seeing Indra come, the unbearable splendour vanished immediately. Indra was surprised.

20. Then Indra thought to himself again and again, "I seek refuge in him alone whose conduct is such as this."

21-22. In the meantime, in order to bless them and remove their arrogance, Siva, the embodied form of undeceitful mercy, existence, knowledge and bliss, manifested herself on the ninth day of the bright half of the month Gaitra when the sun was in the middle of the day.

23. Shining among the mass of splendour she brightened the quarters with her brilliance. She enlightened the gods, saying "I alone am Brahman."

24. In her four hands she held boons, noose, goad and the mystic gesture of protection. She was served by the Vedas and looked beautiful and proud of her blooming youth.

25. She wore red garments and red garlands. Red sandal paste was smeared over her body. She was as dazzling as a crore of cupids. Her lustre was that of a crore moons.

26. The great Maya, in the form of the immanent soul of all, the cosmic witness of all living beings, and the great Brahman, spoke. Umd said: —

27. Neither Brahma nor Visnu nor Siva the slayer of

# Sivapurana

the Tripura demon can bluff before me. What about the other gods?

28. The great Brahman, the great light in the form of the two Pranavas, I alone am. I am all. There is none other beside me.

29. Though devoid of form I possess forms. I constitute all principles. I am eternal and my attributes cannot be disputed. I am both the cause and the effect.

30. Sometimes I have the form of a woman, sometimes of a man. Sometimes both. I am the goddess assuming all forms.

31. I am the creator, the protector and the destroyer of the world. I am the enchantress of the universe. All the Saktis—Kali, Lakshmi and Sarasvati as well as others are born of my parts. So also the arts originate from me.

32. Due to my power alone the demons are conquered by you. Without knowing me of this nature you bluff as the lords of all.

34. Just as a magician makes the wooden doll of a woman dance so also I the goddess make all living beings dance.

35. Being afraid of me the wind blows, the fire-god burns and the guardians of the quarters carry on their duties.

36. Independent that I am, I sportively bestow victory on the gods sometimes and on the Daityas sometimes.

37. It is my form that is described in the Vedas as indestructible, the great abode, the one beyond Maya and that which is greater than the greatest.

38. My form is two-fold—Saguna and Nirguna. One is mixed with Maya and the other is free from it.

39. O gods, endowed with devotion, realise this and eschew your arrogance, worship me, the eternal Prakrti.

40. On hearing the merciful words of the goddess, the gods eulogised her, with their shoulders drooping with devotion.

41. O goddess of the universe, forgive us. O goddess, be pleased. O mother, let us not be arrogant again. Please be merciful.

42. Since then the gods began to propitiate her as

# CHAPTER FIFTY

# (The incarnation of Satdkfi etc.)

The sages said:

1. O intelligent one, all of us are anxious to hear the episode of Durga every day. Please tell us another wonderful tale of the goddess.
2. O Suta, the most excellent of the story-tellers, we are not satiated even as we hear different nectarine stories narrated by you.

Suta said:

The most powerful son of Ruru, famous as Durgama secured the four Vedas as a result of the boon granted by Brahma.
Securing this strength that cannot be thwarted even by the gods he wrought havoc on the earth, making the gods tremble in heaven.
When the Vedas were destroyed the sacred rites were ruined. Brahmins and the gods fell off from their right conduct.
None offered charitable gifts; none performed penances; there was neither worship nor sacrifice. Then a great drought befell the earth extending to a period of a hundred years.
There was a great hue and cry in all the three worlds. The people felt miserable being afflicted by hunger and thirst.
Rivers, oceans, tanks, wells and lakes dried. Trees and plants withered.

9. On seeing the misery of the distressed subjects the gods sought refuge in the Yogic Maya, Mahe£varl.

The gods said—

10. O Mahamaya, save all your people. Check your fury or the worlds will be ruined.

11-12. O ocean of mercy, O supportress of the distressed, kill this demon too just as you have killed Sumbha, Nisumbha. Dhumraksa, Canda, Murnja, Raktablja, Madhu, Kai{abha and Mahisa.

13. Boys are guilty of offence at every step but who on earth brooks it except the mother?

14. When miseries afflict the gods and the brahmins you incarnate for the welfare of the people.

15. On hearing the distress of the gods the merciful goddess revealed to them her form possessed of many eyes.

16. The goddess with her lotus-face beaming with delight held in her four hands the bow, the arrows, the lotus and different fruits and roots.

17. On seeing her people scorched and distressed, the goddess was dejected. With her eyes full of mercy she cried for nine days and nights.

18. The tears took the forms of thousands of water-currents released from her eyes. The worlds, the plants and medicinal herbs were delighted by them.

19. They turned into the rivers and oceans of deep waters. Vegetables, roots and fruits grew on the earth.

20. To the learned and the gods she distributed the fruits in her hands. To the cows she gave the tender blades of grass and to others the things they deserved.

21. All gods, including the brahmins and men were satisfied. Then the goddess said “What else shall I do for you?”

22. The gods then gathered together and said, “The people have been rendered happy and satisfied. O goddess, be pleased and redeem the Vedas taken by Durgama.”

23. After saying “So be it” she said. “Go ye all to your abodes. Ere long I shall give you the Vedas.”

24. Then the joyous gods returned to their abodes after.

bowing to the goddess the cause of the universe with her eyes that resembled full-blown blue lotus.

1. Then a great bustle arose in the three regions heaven, earth and sky. On hearing it the son of Ruru besieged the city immediately.
2. Then after creating a big circle of splendour all round for the protection of the gods, Siva herself came out of it.
3. A great battle ensued between the goddess and the Daitya. Both showered arrows in the battle, piercing the armour of each other.
4. In the meantime ten beautiful forms came out of Kali Viz Tara, Chinnamasta, Srlvidya, Bhuvanesvari, Bhairavi, Bagala, Dhumra, Srimattripurasundarl, Matangl and Mahavidya with weapons in their hands.
5. Then appeared innumerable mothers of divine forms, wearing the digit of the moon and with a lustre resembling the splendour of lightning.
6. Then a terrible combat ensued between the Asuras and the mothers. The army of the son of Ruru, consisting of a hundred Aksauhinis was killed in the battle.
7. Then the goddess struck Durgama with the edge of her trident. He fell on the earth like an uprooted tree.
8. Thus after killing him the goddess redeemed the four Vedas and gave them to the gods.

The gods said:

O Ambika, for our welfare that form of infinite eyes was assumed by you. Hence sages will glorify you as Sataksl.
Since the worlds were sustained by you with vegetables sprouting from your body, you will be famous as Sakambhari.
O Siva, since you killed the Daitya Durgama you will be known as Durga.
O Yogic slumber, O Mahabala, O bestower of knowledge, O the mother of the universe, Obeisance be to you.

O Mother, we who are unaware of your power and greatness, cannot adequately eulogise you who are inaccessible through words, mind or body and whose eyes are the sun and the moon.

# 40.

Who else will bestow mercy on seeing us the gods except the great goddess Sataksi the mother?

# 41.

Effort shall be made by you so that the three worlds will not be pestered continuously with obstacles and our enemies shall be destroyed.

# The gods said:

# 42.

Just as the cows run about in excitement quickly on seeing their calves in distress, so also I, Sati, am excited on seeing you in distress and run about.

# 43.

Even a moment appears to be a Yuga if I do not see you since I look at you as my own children for whom I am ready even to lay down my life.

# 44.

No worry or anxious thought need be entertained by you endowed with devotion as long as I stand by you destroying your distress.

# 45.

In the manner I have killed the Daityas I shall kill the Asuras. You need not entertain any doubt in this regard. Truth, I am speaking the truth.

# 46-47.

I shall be born of the womb in the family of cowherds as the daughter of Yasoda wife of Nanda, when Sumbha and Nisumbha will be born as Daityas. I shall kill the demons and become famous. Men will therefore call me Nandaja.

# 48.

Since I shall be taking the form of a bee and killing the demon Aruna, men will glorify me as Bhramarl.

# 49.

Again I shall take a terrible form and devour the Raksasas. I shall then be famous as Bhima Devi.

# 50.

Whenever there is harassment caused by the Asuras I shall surely incarnate and work for your welfare.

# 51.

The goddess Sataksi, Sakambhari and Durga are identical. In all the three the individual is the same.

# CHAPTER FIFTY ONE

# (Review of holy rites)

The sages said:

1. O blessed disciple of Vyasa, O Suta the most excellent among the knowers of the Puranas, we wish to hear some other story of the lord.
2. We wish to hear the most excellent sacred rites of Uma, the mother of the universe, those which were narrated to Vyasa the great Atman by Sanatkumara.

Suta said:

All of you are blessed great souls; steady in your devotional rites to the goddess. Now listen devotedly to the well-guarded secret of the great Sakti.

Vyasa said: O omniscient Sanatkumara, O intelligent son of Brahma, I wish to hear the wonderful holy rites of Uma.

Please tell me what is pleasing to the great mother. What are its characteristics and on doing what can it be efficacious?

Sanatkumara said:

O Dvaipayana of great intellect, listen to the full description I am going to give of the secret that you ask.
Three paths of the glorious mother have been narrated which yield both worldly pleasures and salvation. They are paths of knowledge, holy rites and devotion.
Jñanayoga is the union of the mind with the Atman. The union with the external objects is called Kriyayoga.
Bhaktiyoga is the concept of the unity of the Atman with the goddess. Of the three I mention Kriyayoga in detail.

---

10. It is concluded in the sacred scriptures that devotion is generated by activities, knowledge is born of devotion, liberation is the result of knowledge.

11. O excellent sage, the chief reason of liberation is the Yoga. Kriyayoga is the greatest means of liberation.

12. One shall know the Maya as Prakfti and the wielder of Maya as the eternal Brahman. After realising the identity of the two one is released from the world by bondage. O Vyasa, merit of person

13-14. listen to the the who builds a temple to the goddess either of stone or of wood or of mud. He who builds a temple to the goddess attains the benefit which a person who worships every day through Yoga attains in plenty. That virtuous soul who builds the temple for the glorious mother enables a thousand past and a thousand future members of his family to attain liberation.

15. The sins committed by a person in a crore of births, whether they be small or big, are quelled at the very moment when the foundation for temple of the glorions mother is laid.

16-17. The glorious great Amba is the most excellent among all the deities just as Ganga and Sona among the rivers, the earth in forbearance, the ocean in majesty and the sun among the planets.

18. She is the most important among all the deities. He who causes her temple to be built attains established power in every birth.

19-21. One who makes the temple for the mother in any of these holy centres becomes free from bondage—viz. Varanasi, Kuruk?etra, Prayaga, Pu$kara, the banks of the Ganga or the shores of the ocean, Naimiga, amarakantaka, the highly meritorious Sriparvata, Gokarna, Jftanaparvata, Mathura, Ayodhya, Dvaravati etc.

22. He is honoured in the Mapidvipa for as many thousand years as the number of years the brickwork holds good.

# 23.

He who makes idols with the full complement of characteristics fearlessly attains indeed the great region of Uma.

# 24.

After installing the image of the goddess, in the auspicious stars, planets and the season, man becomes contented and blessed by the favour of the Yogamaya.

# 25.

After installing an auspicious image of the goddess one can redeem the men of one’s family both of the past and the future. O leading by the goddess merit.

# 26.

Sage, installing the derived is a crore times more than that derived by establishing the three worlds.

# 27.

The merit cannot be calculated of the man who installs the Paftcayatana deities with Ambika in the centre and the other four in the four quarters.

# 28-31.

One attains great merit by repeating the names of Visnu a crore times during the solar and lunar eclipses, a hundred crore times by repeating the names of Siva, a crore times by repeating the names of Sridevi, a crore times by building the palace for the goddess. To the man who installs the image of the goddess, mother of the universe, identical with the three Vedas there is nothing inaccessible, thanks to the merit of the glorious mother. His sons, grandsons and others flourish. All his sins perish.

# 32.

Even those who desire mentally the installation of the excellent image attain the great region of Uma inaccessible even to the sages.

# 33-34.

If a man, on seeing the image being made or the temple being built thinks mentally: “If I get sufficient wealth I too will make”, his family attains heaven undoubtedly. What is there in the three worlds which cannot be secured by the power of Mahamaya?

# 35.

Those who have resorted only to the goddess the cause of the universe, are not ordinary men. They are the Ganas of the Goddess herself.

# 36.

Those who repeat the two syllables “U-ma” day and night, sitting, sleeping or moving become Siva’s Ganas.

Who can calculate the merit of a person who performs the ablution of the installed image of the glorious mother, with clarified butter after smearing it with honey?

The intelligent king of Ayodhya, Sudarsana, son of Dhruvasandhi secured the lost kingdom. Performing this great rite and propitiating the goddess the Vaisya Samadhi being liberated from worldly bondage attained salvation.

# Chapter One

# The discussion among Vydsa, Saunaka and others

1. Obeisance to Siva accompanied by Amba, his sons and the Ganas, obeisance to the lord of Pradhana and Puru$a, obeisance to him who is the cause of creation, sustenance and dissolution.

The sages said:

2. The beautiful Umasamhita full of various anecdotes we have heard. Now narrate the Kailasasamhita that propagates Siva’s tenets.

Vydsa said:

3. O dear, now listen with pleasure. Out of affection for you I shall narrate the divine Samhita Kailasa expounding Siva’s tenets.

4. Formerly the sages of great power and splendour performing penances on the summit of Himavat97 desired to go to Varanasi98 and decided accordingly.

5. They started from the mountain and reached Ka$I. They decided to bathe there and saw Manikarnika.

6-8. The lordly sages bathed there and performed the Tarpana rites to the gods and others and to Gahga. They visited Vi£ve£a the lord of the gods, bowed and worshipped him with devotion. The sages, the masters of the Vedas eulogised him with Satarudra and other mantras and thought “O, we are blessed. We are content.” Due to Siva’s pleasure they realised everything. They remained ever engaged in devotion to Siva.

97. This celebrated mountain extends from the Eastern to the Western Sea, is formed after the shape of a bow-string and forms the northern bounds of Bharatavarsa.

98. It is named after Varar>a and Asi, the tributaries of the Ganges on which the city is situated.

After bowing to ViSveSvara, the lord of gods, the consort of Uma, Suta entered the Muktimantjapa¹⁰¹ along with them.

# 11.</h9>
When Suta the great soul, the excellent of the Pauranikas took his seat, the sages paid respects to him with Arghya and other ingredients of worship.

# 12.</h9>
The delighted Suta saw the sages of auspicious rites and enquired after their health and welfare. They replied suitably.

# 13.</h9>
On seeing him pleased at heart the sages spoke in relevance to the context, in order to know the meaning of Pranava.

# 14.</h9>
O blessed disciple of Vyasa, Suta the best among the Pauranikas, you are a great devotee of Siva, the ocean of perfect knowledge.

# 15.</h9>
Lord Vyasa, the preceptor of the universe has crowned you as the chief of the Pauranikas and made you the propounder of the Puranas.

# 16.</h9>
The Pura$ic lore is firmly set in your heart. Indeed the Puranas explain the meaning of the Vedas.

# 17.</h9>
Vedas arise from the Pranava. The Pranava is lord Siva. Hence you are the permanent abode of lord Siva’s stay. We shall be free from illness after we have drunk

Suta said:

22. Well done, well done, O blessed sages, your sins have been quelled. Your minds are steadied. It is rare in persons of evil deeds.

23-24. O leading sages, I shall narrate to you what was mentioned by my preceptor Vyasa to the sages in the Naimiga forest. On hearing this alone men are blessed with devotion to Siva. You shall listen with attention and joy.

25-27. Formerly in the Svarocisa Manvantara, sages of steady rites performed penance in the Naimisa10 forest where all the Siddhas live. They conducted a sacrifice of long duration, propitiated Rudra the leader of sacrifices. They desired to know the supreme nature of the lord. They waited for Vyasa. They were engaged in devotion to Siva and wore Rudraksa after smearing their bodies with the ashes.

28. Observing their eagerness, lord Badarayana, the soul of all, the fruit of the penance of Paratiara appeared before them.

29. On seeing him the sages were delighted with beaming eyes and faces. They stood up and welcomed him with reverence.

30. With due hospitality they offered him a golden seat. Seated cosily on the golden seat the sage Vyasa spoke majestically.

Vyasa said:

31. Hope you are quite well. Please say. Has the leader of the sacrifices been worshipped well by you in this sacrifice?

32. Why lord Siva accompanied by Amba, the lord who releases from worldly bondage has been worshipped with due devotion by you all in this sacrifice.

33. Your activity seems to me to be the outcome of

your desire to hear more of the great nature of lord Siva, the cause of salvation.

34-35. Thus urged by the sage Vyasa of great brilliance the great sages of the Naimisa forest bowed to him, the noble soul whose mind was delighted by his devotion to Siva.

The sages said:

36-37. O holy lord, O leading sage, born of Nfirayana’s part, O storehouse of mercy, O intelligent one, O holy lord of all lores, you are the storehouse of the favours of Mahadeva, lord of the universe, accompanied by Amba and the Ganas.

38. Our minds have been yearning for the sight of your lotus feet even as the bees yearn for the touch of lotus flowers. We are now satisfied by the vision of your lotus feet.

39. Inaccessible indeed is the sight of your lotus feet to the sinners. Since now we have obtained it we are really fortunate.

40-42. O blessed one, we are performing this long sacrifice in this Naimisaranya. We wanted to know the meaning of the Pranava. We are discussing the greatness of lord Siva and wish to hear all about him. But we cannot understand the same. Now it behoves you to clear off our doubts. O holy lord, we are only small-minded.

43-44. There is none else in the three worlds to clear our doubts. We are immersed in the ocean of delusion, vast and shoreless. Storehouse of mercy, take us across this ocean in the raft of Siva’s knowledge. We are truly eager to know the principle of Siva’s devotion.

45-46. Requested by the sages, the master of the Vedas, the great sage, father of Suka, chief of the Vedic scholars, meditated within the pericarp of his heart, on lord Siva who releases from worldly existence and who is Pranava, the essential substance of Vedanta. Being delighted in his mind, the great sage spoke.

# CHAPTER TWO

(The dialogue between the god and the goddess)

Vydsa said:

1. O blessed brahmins, the question has been well put by you. The knowledge of Siva’s principle that illuminates the meaning of Pfanava’s incomprehensible. It can be obtained surely by those with whom the trident-bearing lord is pleased and not by others who are undoubtedly devoid of Siva’s devotion. This is true.
2. Lord Siva, consort of Amba, has been adored by you by long sacrifices. This I see actually.
3. O devotees, I shall narrate to you an ancient story containing a wonderful dialogue between Uma and Siva.
4. Formerly Sati, daughter of Daksa, the mother of the universe abandoned her body in the sacrifice of her father in view of the insult offered to Siva. As a result of the penance the goddess became the daughter of the Himavat. On the advice of Narada she performed a penance for Siva on that mountain. When lord Siva married her with Svayamvara rites Parvati attained happiness.
5. Once she was cosily seated with lord Siva on that great mountain. She spoke to the lord.
6. O omniscient lord who hath ordained to himself the five-fold duties, O lord easily accessible through devotion, O lord of nectarine body, I was the daughter of Dak$a in my former birth. I abandoned my body because of the insult offered to you. I have now become the daughter of the mountain Himavat.
7. O lord, please make me merged in the principle of pure Atman by duly initiating me in the Mantras.
8. Thus requested by the goddess the moon-crested lord replied to the goddess with a delighted mind.

Vidyesvarasamhita (17.9;,) recounts the five actions by which the supreme power manifests. These are:

Lord Siva said:

1. If your mind is thus diverted, O goddess, you are blessed indeed. I shall initiate you so after going to the summit of Kailasa.
2. Then after leaving Himavat and reaching Kailasa, the lord of mountains, Siva, recited mantras Pranava and others in the proper order after duly initiating her.
3. Then making the goddess merged in the pure Atman, lord Siva went to his garden accompanied by the goddess.
4. Siva bedecked the goddess with the full-blown kalpa tree flowers brought by the dearest friends of the goddess the chief of whom was Sumalini. He made her sit on his lap. Looking at her face he sat there with his face beaming with delight.
5. Then ensued the delightful discourse conformable to the Vedas between Parvati and lord Siva. It was meant for the welfare of the world.
6. O ascetics, then the mother of the universe seated on the lap of her husband looked at the lord’s face and said.

The goddess said:

O lord, you have discoursed on the Mantras including the Pranava. There at the outset I wish to know the meaning of the Pranava. How
How did Pranava originate? is Pranava mentioned? How many Matras have been mentioned? How is it that it is called the initial mantra of the Vedas?
How many deities are mentioned? What is the concept of the Vedas thereto? What types of rites are mentioned? What is their cause and what is their result?
How do the five Brahmans stay in this mantra in their proper order? How many Kalas are enumerated? How is it the Atman of the universe?
O Siva, what is the link between the syllables and their meaning? What are the places of their articulation? Who is authorised in this? What is the theme?

104. It is a mythical wish-filling tree of Indra’s Paradise.

26. What is the link between the knower and the known and what is the purpose? What shall be the nature of the practising devotee? What shall be the place for the practice of meditation?

27. Of what form is the object of devotion? What is the benefit derived from this? What is the procedure? What is the place of worship?

28. What is the mystic diagram of the worship? Siva, what are the sages and the rules regarding Nyasa, Japa etc.? What is the order of procedure in this worship?

29. O lord Siva, please mention these all particularly, if you have mercy on me. I wish to hear everything factually.

30. Thus implored, the moon-crested lord praised the goddess and began to explain.

# CHAPTER THREE

# [The way of Sannydsa]

Lord Siva said:

1. O goddess, listen. I shall explain what you have asked for. Merely by hearing this the individual soul becomes Siva himself.

2. To understand the meaning of Pranava is to understand me. Pranava is the seed of all the lores.

3. It shall be understood as very subtle but possessed of great meaning even as the seed of the Banyan tree though very small contains a huge tree. It is the initial mantra and the essence of the Vedas. Particularly it has me for its form.

4. I am the soul far beyond the attributes, the omniscient and the omnipotent. I am Siva pervading all but rationed in the single-syllabled mantra Om.

5. They say that whatever object there is whether hesised into one or analysed in pieces is the meaning of

Pranava, thanks to the combination and importance of the attributes.

# 6.

It is the imperishable Brahman, the means of attaining all objects. Siva creates universe at the outset saying “Om”.

# 7.

Since there is not much difference between the sense and the sound Om, this is explained thus. Siva is Pranava or Pranava is Siva.

# 8.

The brahminical sages, the scholars who realize the identity between the sense and the sound know me as the single-syllabled Om.

# 9.

Hence he who aspires for salvation and is free from aberration shall understand Pranava as the cause of all and me as the Nirguna Paramcsvara.

# 10.

O goddess, I shall give this crest-jewel of mantras at Kasi for the liberation of all Individual souls.

# 11.

O Amba, there at the outset I shall explain Pranavoddhara, the knowledge of which imparts the greatest achievement.

# 12.

Firstly the devotee shall extricate Nivrtti, then the fuel, time, s. iff, and the lord.

# 13.

Thus the Pranava of five syllables is explained by extricating the three Matras, Bindu and Nada. It yields liberation to those who perform the Japa in this manner.

# 14.

Pranava is the vital breath of all living beings from Brahma to immobile beings. Being the Prana thus, it is called Pranava.

# 15.

It consists of A, U and M in the middle, Bindu and Nada at the end. That is Om.

# 16.

O excellent sage, the first letter (A) is like water in the south, the second letter (U) is in the north the letter M is like fire in the middle, before Bindu.

# 17.

The three Matras are thus mentioned in order: A, U, M. Half a matra is beyond it.

# 18.

O goddess, this half matra is in the form of Bindu and Nada. This cannot be described directly. It is known only by the wise.



---


# 19.

O beloved, the Vcdic texts beginning with “Isanab Sarvavidyanam” issue from me. The Vedas indeed speak the truth.

# 20.

I am the source of the Vedas. Pranava expresses me. Since it expresses me the Pranava too is mentioned as Vedadi.

# 21.

‘A’ is the great Bija, Rajas, the four-faced creator. ‘U’ is the Prakrti, source, Sattva, the protector Vi$nu.

# 22.

‘M’ is the Puru sa, the Bijin, Tamas, the annihilator Siva. Bindu is Mahesvara the lord, the disappearance.

# 23.

Nada is Sadasiva the bestower of blessings on all. On the top of Nada there is Siva who is greater than the greatest.

# 24.

He is omniscient, the creator, the lord, free from dirt, the imperishable, the inexpressible, the great Brahman, beyond the existent and the nonexistent.

# 25.

In the letters ‘A’ etc. the later one is pervasive of the earlier. The earlier one is the pervaded.

# 26.

The five Brahmans beginning with Sadya and ending with Isana are stationed in the five letters ‘A’ etc. They are my very forms in order.

# 27.

O Siva, in the syllable ‘A’ eight Kalas of the form of Sadya exist. “In ‘U’ thirteen Kalas of the form of Varna exist.

# 28.

The eight Kalas of the form of Aghora are stationed in ‘M’. In Bindu four Kalas of the form of Purusa exist.

# 29.

In Nada five Kalas born of I*ana are present. Thus their state of being the soul of the universe is due to the recognition of their sixfold identity.

# 30.

The sixfold objects constitute Mantra, Yantra, deity, universe, the preceptor and the disciple. O beloved, listen to the meaning of these objects.

# 31.

The mantra previously mentioned is a composite.

of five letters. The same attains the form of a Yantra. I shall mention the details of its mystic diagram.

# 32.

Yanta is in the form of the deity; the deity is in the form of the universe; the preceptor too is in the form of the universe and the disciple is of the body of the preceptor.

# 33.

Om is everything, everything is Brahman. (Om Itidam Sarvam Iti Sarvam Brahma) This Vedic Text establishes the link between the word and its meaning.

# 34-35.

The places of articulation, O goddess are: Adhara (support), Manipura (jewel-refill), Hrdaya (heart), ViSuddhi (purity), Ajfia (order), Sakti (power), Santi. Beyond Santi is the lord who is greater than the greatest. The authorised person is he whose non-attachment is firm and stable.

# 36-37.

O goddess, I shall be the theme, thanks to the concept of the identity of the individual and the universal soul. The subject has been clearly mentioned. O goddess, now listen. The link of the Jiva and the Atman with me and the Pranava is as between the word and its sense.

# 38-42.

A brahmin with the following characteristics shall approach the preceptor with the requisite qualifications. He shall be regularly engaged in holy rites, be calm, perform penance, shall have self-control, be a brahmin well-versed in the Vedas and endowed with cleanliness and good conduct, unattached to the pleasures of this world and of the next and of the worlds of the gods. He shall perform the holy rites of Siva. The preceptor shall be one who has understood the tenets and the meanings of sacred texts; who has mastered Vedanta; who is an ascetic and the most excellent of intelligent men. After approaching him the intelligent brahmin shall prostrate before him and propitiate him by reverential deeds. That disciple is the most excellent who possesses good behaviour and the qualities of peaceful calmness. The disciple shall realise that preceptor is Siva and Siva is the preceptor. Then he shall reveal his thought.

# 43-52.

After being permitted by the preceptor the brahmin devotee shall perform holy rites without taking anything except milk, for twelve days on the sea-shore, or on the banks of a river, or on a mountain or in a temple of...

To Siva in the form of the preceptor he shall give Daksina according to the scriptures. He shall collect articles for Homa, place the holy fires, laukika and others, with the rules of his Grhya Sutra. A brahmin who consecrates the sacred fire shall perform this Aupasana in the sacrificial fire consecrated by the Prajapatya sacrifice, reciting mantras from the Vedas and offering due Daksinas. Then the brahmin shall superimpose the fire in the Atman and formally renounce the world. The food-offering shall be cooked with the fire-wood and cooked rice and ghee. He shall perform the sacrifice repeating the Purusa Sukta.

The ghee shall be offered at the end of every stanza. The Sauvistakrti shall be performed in accordance with the rules of his own Sutra. After the sacrifice he shall perform Tantric activities. The learned devotee shall sit on a cloth, deer-skin or Ku>a grass to the north of the fire. He shall repeat the Gayatrl mantra silently till the Brahma Muhurta, and stabilise his mind firmly.

Then he shall take bath and cook the Caru. He shall perform the sacrifice beginning with Purusa and ending with the Viraja suktas.

The procedure may follow the opinion of Vamadcva or of Sanaka and others. But the important one is that of Vamadcva because he was a liberated soul even while he was in the womb.

# CHAPTER NINE

# (The mode of interpreting the Pranava)

Lord Siva said:

1. The following eight names indicate Siva—Siva, MaheSvara, Rudra, Visnu, Pitamaha, Samsaravaidya, Saravajfla, Paramatman.
2. The five names of SadaSiva are dependent on their condition. If the condition alters the name too alters.
3. The word is permanent. The object indicated by the word is non-permanent. The words are transferable since those indicated by the words are released.
4. Even when words are transferred there are conditions again. The first five names denote things other than Atman.
5. The other three names derive their origin from difference in the material cause. Siva exists by creating three types of conditions.
6. Due to the antecedent non-existence of the contact with the primordial Avidya he is naturally pure-souled and is called Siva.
7. Lord Siva who is richly endowed with good attributes is called Siva by the experts in the Saiva cult.
8. Prakrti is yonder than the twentythree principles. Purusa, the twenty-fifth principle is yonder than Prakrti. The Purusa is called Svara as expressed in the Vedas. He becomes intelligible and recognizable only through the Vedas and the Upanisads. As the enjoyer he becomes merged in Prakrti. He who is beyond this Purusa is named Mahesvara.
9. He is rightly termed MaheSvara because Prakrti and Purusa are subservient to him. Or Maya is the principle with the three attributes which is imperishable. Know that Maya is the Prakrti and Mayin (the wielder of Maya) is MaheSvara who is eternal and the releaser from Maya. Hence the name MaheSvara is applicable to him.
10. The word Rud means misery or cause of misery.

Kaildsasarhhitd
The lord who dispels it is called Rudra,134 lord Siva, the great or ultimate cause.

15. Siva is called Vi$nu because he pervades the principles of Siva ending with the earth and the bodies, pots etc.

16. Siva is called Pitamaha because of his fatherhood of the Trinity which in turn is the cause of the universe.

17-18. A pathologist diagnoses correctly and cures illness through medicines. Similarly Siva the cause of dissolution, sustenance and origin of the world as well as the router of the gross is called the physician of the world by those who know the nature of the principles.

19-21. Atoms enveloped by the dirt of the ocean of Maya do not know the gross and subtle things that occur in the three periods of time even when they have the sense-organs for imbibing the five-fold knowledge. But SadaSiva knows every existent object naturally, even though he has no sense-organs yielding the knowledge of all existent objects. Hence he is called omniscient.

22. Siva is the great Atman because he is the Atman of all, he is forever endowed with the great qualities and there is no greater Atman than him.

23-26. After eulogising Mahadeva, identical with Pranava, the imperishable and offering gifts on the head of Isana, he worships the lord with the purity of mind, by means of the pranava. He shall then take a handful of flowers, join palms in reverence, inhale through the left nostril, identifying the inhaled air with Siva and exhale through the right nostril bidding the ritualistic adieu to the goddess. He shall realise the identity of Siva with himself. “I am Siva alone.” He shall make the ritualistic dismissal of the deities conceived in the heart.

27. After worshipping the lore and the preceptor he shall fix in the heart the mantras of the conch and the vessel of Arghya.

28-30. After consigning the remnants of the floral offerings to Cantjesa in the north-east quarter he shall restrain.

He shall perform the ablution of the lord with Paflcagavya etc. or with holy water rendered fragrant with scented articles repeating the mantras from the Rg or Samaveda such as ‘Pavamana’ ‘Rudra’ ‘Nila’ or ‘Tvarita’ along with the five Brahmans.

The ascetic shall think on me with devotion in accordance with the rules. O beloved, thus I have narrated to you a great secret that shall be guarded assiduously. It shall not be imparted to any one and everyone. It shall be

given to my devotee, to an ascetic free from passion and lust.

45-46. It shall be given to a person devoted to his preceptor, who is calm and who engages in Yoga for attaining me. The foolish fellow who transgresses my directives and gives this away is my enemy. Surely he will go to hell. O goddess, imparting it to my devotee he will become my favourite. Alter enjoying all pleasures here he shall attain my presence.

Vydsa said:

47-48. On hearing this speech of Siva, the goddess eulogised the lord with various hymns containing the purport of the Vedic mantras. She bowed at the feet of her lord. O excellent sages, she rejoiced with a delighted heart.

49. O brahmins, this is a great secret. It illuminates the meaning of the Pranava. Leading to the knowledge of Siva it destroys all your miseries.

Suta said:

50-52. After saying this, the excellent sage of great penance, the son of Parasara, worshipped and honoured with intent devotion by the sages and propounder of the Vedas, thought of the mount Kailasa and left that hermitage. Delighted in their hearts, at the end of the sacrifice they too worshipped the moon-crested god and the goddess Uma with great devotion. They engaged themselves in Yogic practices of restraint etc. and continued to meditate on Siva.

53. This was mentioned to Guha by the goddess who mentioned it to Nandin. Lord Nandin mentioned it to the sage Sanatkumara.

54. O leading sages, from him this was obtained by my preceptor Vyasa of immeasurable splendour. This holy lore was obtained from him by me also.

55. On knowing your love for the lord and realising that you are his favourite devotee, this secret of secrets has been narrated to you by me.

56. This secret lore dear to Siva shall be given by you only to ascetics of quiet minds, devotees of Siva’s feet.

# CHAPTER TEN

# (iSuta's instruction)

Vydsa said:

When Suta had left, the wondering sages thought and spoke to one another, “What the great sage said about Vamadeva’s opinion has been forgotten. This is indeed distressing to us.

When shall we see the excellent sage again? His sight dispels the vast miseries of worldly existence. May the great sage appear again as a result of the merit accruing from the worship of lord Siva.

The sages who were worried with these thoughts worshipped Suta in the lotus of their heart and stayed there being eager to see him.

At the end of a year, the sage, engaged in devotional activities of Siva, the wise propounder of the meaning to the Puranas, came to Kasi again.

On seeing Suta coming, the sages delighted in their minds, worshipped him duly rising up and offering seat and Arghya.

He too congratulated the sages with a smiling face. With pleasure he took the bath in the holy waters of the Gariga.

He propitiated the sages, the gods and the Pitrs with gingelly seeds and rice grains. He came to the bank and put on his dress after sprinkling it with water.

He performed the Acamana twice and took the Bhasm.i repeating the Sadyadi mantras. Wearing the garland

of ftudrak§a beads he applied the Bhasma to his body and made the Tripundra marks on the limbs. He then performed his routine rites.

10. With great devotion he eulogised, bowed to and worshipped lord Siva and Uma along with his sons and chief Ganas.

11-12. He worshipped Kalabhairava in accordance with the rules after circumambulating him thrice. He prostrated five times and circumambulated again. Thinking upon his lotus-feet he eulogised him again with the great hymn.

13-14. He performed the Japa of the sacred Pancak§ari lore one thousand and eight times. Standing in front of lord Siva’s image he begged for forgiveness. After worshipping him he took his seat in the middle of Muktimandapa offered by the sages who had mastered the Vedas.

15. When all had taken their seats after due obeisance with the recital of the mantras he spoke in accents that increased the piety of the sages.

Suta said: O intelligent sages, you who have fulfilled your vows are blessed. I have come for your sake. Please listen in details.

16. After telling you the meaning of the Pranava I went on a pilgrimage. Now hear the details.

17. O leading brahmans, after starting from here I went to the southern ocean. I took bath therein and worshipped the goddess Siva, Kanyakumarl. On my return I came to the river Suvarnamukhari¹³⁶.

18-25. I reached the wonderful city on the Kalahasti Saila. I took my bath in the waters of Suvarnamukhari¹³⁶ and performed Tarpana to the gods and the sages. Remembering Siva with the mystic signs I worshipped Kalahastisa with the lustre of the lunar stone, the lord with the face directed to the west, the wonderful lord of five faces, the lord who

dispels all sins at his very sight, the lord Trigunesvara who bestows Siddhis, worldly pleasures and salvation. Then with great devotion I worshipped Siva stationed to his right, the goddess who is the bud of the flower of knowledge and the mother of the universe. I performed the Japa of the holy Pancaksari Vidya one thousand eight times. I circumambulated, eulogised and bowed again. Thus I went round the hill every day with great devotion. I observed all restraints and performed rites every day with rejoicing mind.

26. O great sages, I spent four months there by the favour of the goddess —the bud of the flower of knowledge.

27-28. Once I spread the cloth, deerskin and the Kusa grass on the seat. Seated on it silently with restrained mind I entered into the mystic trance. “I am Siva the solidified knowledge and bliss, the perfect one for ever.” This realisation dawned in my heart and I was free from agitation.

29-32. Then my preceptor, the ocean of mercy, resembling the dark cloud, with matted tawny hair resembling the lightning, the tall sage bearing the water-pot and staff and wearing the antelope’s skin, with the body turned white with the ashes having all auspicious marks with the Tripundra shining on the forehead, decorated with Rudraksa garlands and the two lotus-like wide eyes gleaming, appeared in the lotus of my heart. Thereafter I swooned soon, O theists, this was the wonderful incident indeed.

33. Then I opened my eyes and cried. The tears I shed quashed out like a mountain stream.

34. Then a celestial unimbodied voice was heard from the sky. It was wonderful. O brahmins, listen to that devotedly.

35-36. “O blessed son of Suta, go to Varanasi; the sages whom you had instructed before, are desirous of the pleasure of your arrival. They are on fast there too.” After saying this the voice stopped.

37-39. I got up immediately and circumambulated the lord and the goddess with devotion. I bowed and prostrated for twelve times. Considering it the order of my preceptor.

and of Siva and Siva I set out from the temple. O excellent sages, I have come here in forty days. Please bless me. Please tell me what I shall say now.

On hearing the words of Suta, the sages were delighted in their minds. They bowed to the sage Vyasa again and again and said.

# CHAPTER ELEVEN

# ( Description of the Brahman Vamadeva )

The sages said:

1. O Suta, O blessed Suta, you are our excellent preceptor. We ask you if there be your blessing for us, your faithful disciples, as it has been shown by you who are always affectionate to us.
2. The opinion of Vamadeva was hinted at by you at the time of Viraja homa formerly. O sage, it was not heard by us in detail.
3. Now we are eager to hear it reverentially and devotedly, O ocean of mercy. It behoves you to narrate it with pleasure.
4. On hearing this, Suta was thrilled with delight. After making obeisance to lord Siva, the preceptor of preceptors, to the goddess-mother of the trio and to his preceptor Vyasa with devotion he spoke in a majestic tone delighting the sages.

Suta said:

O sages, hail to you. May you remain happy always; devotees of Siva steady-minded and propagators of devotion to Siva.
That wonderful thing has been heard from the lotus-like mouth of the preceptor. This was not mentioned by me before, being afraid of revealing a secret.
Indeed you are highly fortunate devotees of Siva.

Formerly in the Rathantara kalpa the sage Vamadeva, roaming over the earth, entered KumaraSikhara, 137 the southern summit of Meru where the peacock-vehicled lord Karttikeya, son of Siva, stays joyously. The sage was a liberated soul even while he was in the womb. He was the most-honoured among the knowers of Siva’s cult. He knew the reality, and the principles of the Vedas, Agamas, Puranas and other sacred scriptures. He knew the births and activities of all living beings, gods, Asuras, mortals and others. The ashes made his body white. He was bedecked in the knots of matted hair. He had no permanent abode, no desire, no egotism and none of the mutually opposing feelings and emotions. He was unclad. He was very wise like Siva himself. He was surrounded by the leading sages who were like him and who had become his disciples. He sanctified the earth by the pious touch of his feet. His heart dwelt in the great splendour.

# 16.

Lord Karttikeya, the hero possessed of the power of knowledge, the suppressor of the Asuras, stays there along with Gajavalli and bowed to by all the gods.

# 17-21.

Near the lord there is a lake Skandasaras138 as vast as an ocean with plenty of deep, sweet, cool, clear water of wonderful attributes. The sage Vamadeva took his bath there along with his disciples. He saw Skanda seated on the summit attended by the sages, shining like the rising sun, with the peacock as his vehicle. He had four arms and splendid body. He was bedecked in coronet and other ornaments. He was reverentially attended by two excellent Saktis. He held Sakti and a cock. He showed the mystic gestures of boons and protection with his hands. On seeing Skanda the sage worshipped him with devotion and began to eulogise him.

137. It is not identified.

138. This lake formed of the waters of the Kumara hill lying to the south of Meru remains unidentified.

other gods, sages and the Kinnaras, obeisance be to you who are the abode of fame reflected upon by the pious. O lord, whose lotus-like beautiful feet deserve the worship of the garlands that decorate the splendid crowns of the gods, obeisance be to you.

34. He who reads or listens to this divine prayer to Skanda, uttered by Vamadeva, attains the supreme goal.

35. This prayer sharpens intelligence, enhances devotion to Siva, increases longevity, imparts health and affluence and yields all desires always.

36-37. O brahmins, after eulogising lord commander-in-chief of the gods thus, circumambulating him thrice and prostrating on the ground Vamadeva bowed to him once again and went round him. Then he stood bowing down with humility.

38-39. On hearing the eulogy of Vamadeva, unfolding the facts, the lord, son of Mahesvara, was delighted and said “I am delighted by your worship, devotion and eulogy. Welfare be to you. What shall I do for you?

40. O sage, you are the chief of Yogins, perfect and free from avarice. There is nothing for people like you which has to be solicited.

41. Still saintly men like you move about in the world for upholding virtue and blessing the worlds.

42. O Brahmin, if it is fit to be heard you shall speak it out. I shall expound it to the people for their welfare.

43. On hearing the words of Skanda, the sage Vamadeva, bowed with humility and spoke in a tone as majestic as the sound of clouds. Vamadeva said:

44. O lord, you are the great Isa, the bestower of prosperity to all and sundry. You are omniscient; creator of all and the lord bearing all Saktis.

45. We are insignificant creatures to speak before you who are ign at lord. Still it is your blessing that you speak to me.

# 1717

46. O intelligent one, I have but a particle of wisdom. Urged thus I ask you. My transgression must be excused.

47. Pranava is the word that expresses lord Siva. Lord Pasupati is the goal, the releaser of the bondage of the Pa£us, the individual souls.

48. Invoked with the mantra he releases the Jiva instantaneously. Hence siddhi is achieved with the mantra Om for Siva.

49. The eternal Sruti says, “Verily all this is Om; is Brahman. Everything is Brahman.”

50. O commander of the gods, obeisance to you, the lord of the gods and of ascetics. Obeisance to you the perfect one.

51. In this situation, there is nothing distinct from Siva in this world. Siva is the lord who assumes all forms. Mahesvara is all-pervasive.

52. The universal and the personal application of Pranava was heard by me. O lord, but I have never had a preceptor like you to tell me that.

53. Hence take pity on me and reveal its meaning in accordance with the rules of instruction and the conduct of the good.

54. My lord alone is the preceptor who cuts off the bondage. O preceptor, now favour me with the exposition of its meaning.

55. Thus requested by the sage, Skanda bowed to Sadasiva, the very pranava itself who is characterised by thirty-eight excellent digits, who is accompanied by Uma at his side and who is followed by the excellent sages. He then began to expound the path of welfare well guarded in the Vedas.

# ( The procedure of Sannydsa)

Subrahmanya said: O V^madcva, O

1. Well done, well done, fortunate great sage, you are a great devotee of Siva and the most excellent of those who possess Siva’s knowledge.
2. Nowhere in the world is there anything not known to you. Still I shall tell you since you wish to bless the worlds.
3. All the individuals in the world are deceived by the Maya of Isa. They are deceived by various sacred scriptures.
4. They do not know the great lord, the meaning of the Pranava, the Nirguna and Saguna Brahman, the great progenitor of trinity.
5. I shall lift up my right hand and swear unto you truth again and again.
6. 6-12. Siva is declared as the purport of the Pranava in the Sruti and Smrti texts, Puranas and the Agamas; from whom words recede unable to reach him along with the mind; the knower of whose bliss does not have fear from anywhere; from whom this entire universe, beginning with Brahma, Vi$nu and Indra is born at the outset with the groups of sense-organs and elements; that which has no cause anywhere at any time; which neither the lightning nor the sun nor the moon does illuminate; by whose splendour this entire universe is resplendent all round; he who is endowed with prosperity himself in the name of Sai-vesvara; who is worthy of being meditated upon by those who are desirous of salvation; he who is the cause of welfare; who is in the middle of the firmament; who is omnipresent, whose soul is light, who is in the form of splendour, knowledge and consciousness; whose splendid Sakti is comprehensible only through emotion and who is both Nirguna and Saguna, unsullied and auspicious.

14. The unsullied being, the primordial and the eternal lord of all who is stated to be the supreme soul has knowledge and the ritual as his innate nature.

15-16. The image of the lord of the gods is Sada£iva himself, the lord with five mantras for his body and the five digits for his physical form. The lord is as bright as crystal, has cool lustre and is delightful. He has five faces, ten arms and fifteen eyes.

17-18. He the ancient lord has Isana for his coronet; Purusa for his face; Aghora for his heart; Vamadeva for his private parts and Sadya for his foot-j^ie is both Sakala and Niskala. The six Saktis, omniscien

20. With reference to the six entities, Mantra, etc., I shall explain the Pranava-souled lord in his composite and personal nature.

21. The order of instruction shall be mentioned at first. Please hear, O sage, indeed the four castes are well known in the world.

22. The Vedas enjoin rituals for the first three castes. The Sudras are excluded since their only activity is service.

23-25. Nothing but the holy rites of the Srutis and Smnis shall be performed by the first three castes in their respective stages of life. Following the conduct of life enjoined for different stages and castes, excellent sages have attained Sayujya form of liberation.

26. The Sruti says that the sages are satisfied by Brahmacarya; the gods by sacrifice; and the Pitrs by progeny.

27-28. Freed from this threefold debt and entering the Vanaprastha stage the devotee shall bear both pleasure and pain, chillness and heat; shall subjugate the senses, control the diet. The ascetic shall practise restraint and other.

means of Yoga so that the intellect becomes stable and unswerving.

29-30. Thus he becomes pious and free from activities. After eschewing all activities he shall be devoted to the pursuit of knowledge. That alone bestows the fruit of living liberation and identity with Siva. It is most excellent and renders free from aberrations those who have restrained their minds.

31. I shall explain different modes of the same with a desire for blessing the worlds. O intelligent one, it is out of affection for you that I do so. Please listen with attention.

32. The ascetic shall approach a preceptor, the most excellent among intelligences; the preceptor who knows the principles of sacred scriptures and has mastered the Vedantic knowledge.

33. After approaching him in accordance with the ideals, the ascetic devotee shall please him assiduously by obeisances, prostration etc.

34. The preceptor is Siva and Siva is the preceptor. After deciding this in mind he shall express his intention.

35-36. Permitted by the preceptor he shall subsist on milk diet and perform rites for twelve days. On the fourth or the tenth day in the bright lunar fortnight he shall take his early morning bath. With pious mind, he shall perform his routine. He shall invite the preceptor and begin the Nandi Sraddha.

In every Sraddha a pair of brahmins shall be invited and their feet washed. He shall then perform the Acamana assiduously.

He shall pray thus: “May the dust-particles from the feet of the brahmins sanctify me. They are the cause of prosperity. They destroy all adversities and constitute the bridge on the vast ocean of worldly existence. Like suns they remove the pitch darkness of distress. Like divine cows they meet the desired objects. They are the embodied holy waters in every pilgrim centre.” After praying thus he shall bow and prostrate with eight limbs touching the ground. He shall then face the east and remember the lotus-feet of Siva.

Wearing the Pavitra in the finger and the sacred thread on the shoulders, being pure and steady he shall perform the Pranayama thrice. Mentioning the Tithi etc. he shall continue: “As an ancillary rite to my formal renunciation I have to perform eight Sraddhas beginning with the Sraddha of VHvedevas and ending with the Sraddha of Matamaha.

13-19. He shall then take bath. If he is feeble he shall smear Bhasma only. He shall cook Caru in the fire and pour ghee over it. Thus sanctifying it he shall consign it to the fire. He shall perform the Japa of the Vyahrtis, Rudra Sukta and the five Brahmans. He shall fix his mind in the lotus-feet of Siva. He shall perform the Japa of Prajapat'i, Indra, Visvedevas and Brahma also, with dative case-endings. Pranava and other mantras shall be repeated ending with Svaha. He shall perform Punyahavacana, say Agnye svaha, show mystic gesture in front of the fire. Then he shall repeat Pranaya svaha and offer five Ahutis to Svi sta-lest fire. He shall repeat Rudrasukta, the five Brahmans, the Caturvyuha mantras, Homa and mystic gestures in accordance with his Vedic branch.

20-21. The same procedure he shall adopt for the other gods, along with their ancillary rites. After these rites beginning with the fire, the Viraja homa of the Atman shall be performed for the purification of the self in the form of twentysix principles.

22-23. He shall say “Let these Tattvas be purified.” For the purity of the principle —Atman, the mantras ‘Arunaketu-kas’ shall be repeated. He shall silently perform the Homa with the Caru and ghee and remember the lotus-feet of Siva. O sage, the principles begin with Prthivi and end with Purusa. Sound, Speech, Ear— are

24-27. Prthivi, these five each. The four head, sides, back, belly and the calves shall be added afterwards in the group—skin etc. The Dhatu group consists of seven. Pranas are five in number. Anna etc. are the five sheaths. Mind, Citta, intellect, ego, Khyati come under Sankalpa. Gunas come after; Prakrti and Purusa follow these. Purusa is the only enjoyer and the five principles are the objects of his enjoyment.

28. O great sage, destiny, time, attachment, Vidya, Kala — this set of five is born of Maya.

29. The Vedas declare: “Maya is identical with Prakrti.” The principles as mentioned in the Sruti are born of that.

30. The Vedas declare “Destiny is the nature of Kala.” This set of five is also called “The wheel of five.”

# 31-33.

Though sentient, the Purusa is confused in thought, not knowing the five principles. Though superior to nature he falls below Prakrti as the eye of the crow. This set of five — the pure Vidya Mahesvara, Sadasiva, Sakti and Siva is called Vidvatattva or Sivatattva. This is implied in the Vedic text “Prajnfmam Brahma.”

# 34.

O Sage, the purity of the principles from Prthivi to Siva is effected through the dissolution of its cause.

# 35.

With the eleven mantras he shall mention the god. The word Sivajyotis shall be used in the dative case.

# 36-38.

After “Svuha” he shall say “Na mama” (not to me). By this, renunciation of motive is indicated. In the mantras “Vividya” “Kas{apota” after the word Vyapakava the word Paramatmane shall be used. The words “Sivajyotis” “Visvabhiita” and “Ghasanotsuka” shall be mentioned in dative case. After mentioning the god by name the word Devaya shall be uttered.

# 39.

After “Visvai upfiya” in the mantra “Uttislhasva” the word “Purusuya” shall be uttered and the words “(_>m SvalnV” shall be added.

# 40.

At the end of the word “Lokatraya” the words “Vyapinc Parainattnane Sivayedam Na Mama” shall be added.

# 41-42.

He shall conclude the rite according to his own branch of the Veda. He shall eat Caru mixed with ghee and then give fee of gold etc. to the priest. After the ritualistic dismissal of Brahma he shall perform the morning worship.

# 43-45.

He shall recite the mantra “Saiii main sincantu Maruta.” He shall warm his hand over the fire repeating the mantra “Ya te Agnc” and superimpose the fire in his own Atman, abode of the universal soul. He shall perform the morning prayers and pay respects to the sun. He shall enter water up to the navel, perform the Japa of the mantras with pleasure, devotion and steadiness.

fires regularly shall perform the Prajapatya rite in the sacrificial fire and give his entire possession as gift.

47-51. The brahmin shall superimpose fire in his Atman and leave the house. In the Savitri mantra he shall utter the first foot and say ‘I enter Savitri Bhuh Om.’ Then he shall utter the second foot and say I enter Savitri Bhuvah Om. He shall utter the third foot and say I enter Savitri Suvah Om. Then he shall repeat all the three feet and say Savitrim Pravesayami, at the end of which he shall say Bhuh Bhuvah Suvah Om with great pleasure and steady mind.

52-56. He shall then think— “This is Goddess herself having half the body of Siva. She has five faces, ten arms and fifteen eyes. She is bedecked with a down set with nine gems over which the crescent moon rises. She is auspicious, pure as crystal and bears ten weapons. Her body is adorned with necklaces, shouldcrlets, bangles and anklets. Her ornaments are studded with gems. She wears brilliant garments. She is served by Visnu, Brahma the leader of the gods, sages, Gandharvas and human beings. She is Siva pervading all Atmans. She is charming wife of lord Sadasiva. She is the mother of the universe and the trio. She is unborn. She is Saguna and Nirguna as well.

57. After thinking thus the intelligent devotee shall perform the Japa of Gayatri the primordial goddess comprising three metrical feet. She is unborn and the bestower of brahminhood.

58. The scribe who repeats Gayatri in any other manner is tortured in the terrible hell for the period of kalpa.

59. She is born of and merged into Vyahrtis. Vyahrtis are born of the Pinnava and are merged in Pranava.

60. Pranava is the initial of all mantras of the Vedas. It expresses Siva. It is the emperor of all mantras. It is the great Bija, the greatest mantra.

61. Siva is Pranava, Pranava is Siva since there is no difference between Siva and Pranava that expresses Siva.

62. It is this very mantra that Siva speaks to in-

# 63.

Hence good ascetics worship Siva the single-syllabled lord who being the cause of the universe is stationed in the lotus of the heart.

# 64.

Men desirous of salvation and unattached to worldly pleasures worship Siva after realising the futility of worldly pleasures.

# 65.

After dissolving Gayatri in the Pranava identical with Siva he shall recite the hymn “aham vrksasya re-riva.”

# 66.

He shall repeat the hymn beginning with “Yah Chandasam Rsabhah” and ending with “gopaya.” Then he shall say I have got up.

# 67.

O sage, he shall recite the mantras in the low, medium and high tone beginning with the Pranava in the order of creation, sustenance and dissolution.

# 68-69.

In this order he shall say Om Bhuh I have renounced. Om Bhuvah I have renounced. Om Suvah I have renounced. Then he shall say the composite Vyahrtis Om Bhuh, Bhuvah, Suvah.

# 70.

O sage, he shall say “I have renounced after meditating on Sadasiva in the heart in the low, medium and high pitch gradually.

# 71.

After muttering the Presa mantras with attentive mind he shall say “Let all living beings have fearlessness from me, Svaha.”

# 72.

He shall take water in the cupped palms and pour it to the east. He shall uproot the tuft and take out the sacred thread.

# 73-74.

Taking the two in the cupped palms along with water he shall say Om Bhuh “Go thou to the ocean” after uttering Suaha, the name of the wife of the fire. Along with the water in the palms he shall put the two in the water uttering Presa mantras. After performing Acamana thrice he shall come to the bank and cast off all the clothes.

75-76. He shall then foot a short distance more than seven paces facing north or the east. Then the preceptor shall ask him to stop saying, “for your stay and activity in the world, O holy one, accept this loin-cloth and staff.” He shall hand them over to him with his own hands.

77-78. After giving the loin-cloth with its string, and the ochre-coloured robe he shall ask him to wear them. After performing Acamana twice he shall tell the disciple thus “You are the thunderbolt of Indra.” After praying and saying “A good companion”, he shall take up the staff.

79. He shall approach the preceptor remembering the lotus-like feet of Siva and fall at his feet thrice with fully restrained mind.

83-85. The preceptor shall take the white ashes of the Viraja fire. Repeating the mantras “Agniriti Bhasma” he shall apply the sacred ashes over the body of the disciple from head to foot. Repeating the five mantras “Isana” “Tryayusa” “Tryambakam Y°jamahe” he shall apply the Tripundra marks too beginning with head.

86. Then the disciple shall meditate devotedly on Siva, the consort of Uma in the lotus of his heart.

87. Putting his hand on the head of the disciple the preceptor shall utter the Pranava thrice into the right ear of the disciple along with the names of the sage etc.

Vdmadcva said:

1. O Karttikeya, the nectarine ocean of perfect knowledge, son of Siva the lord of gods and the dispeller of distress of the devotees what is perfect knowledge of the sixfold topics that bestows all desires? What are the six topics? What is the perfect knowledge?
2. What is explained therein? What is the fruit of that knowledge? Please mention all that I have asked.
3. Without knowing this I have been deluded by Siva’s Maya. I am ignorant of the Pasupata Sastra.

5-6. I have sought refuge in your lotus-feet. Glancing at me for a long time with your eyes drenched with the nectar of sympathy you shall bless me so that I shall become free from delusion, drink in the nectarine potion of the knowledge of the feet of Siva.

7. On hearing these words of the sage the lord bearing the trident of knowledge said words causing fears to other systems of theology.

Subrahmanya said:

8-9. O revered sage, you have enquired about the perfect knowledge of Siva in his composite and individual state. O performer of good rites, I shall explain that in detail. Perfect knowledge comprises the meaning of Pranava by realizing the unity of six topics.

10-11. The first topic is the mantra; the second Yantra; the third deity; the fourth the cosmos; the fifth the preceptor; the sixth the Atman of the disciple.

12. O excellent sage, I shall explain to you the form of the mantra which makes a man possessed of perfect knowledge.

13. The first and the fifth vowels, the fifth letter of the fifth class of consonants, Bindu and Nada these five letters are mentioned by the Vedas. Om

14-15. The initial mantra of the Vedas i.e. is of the composite form. Nada too is the composite of all. The set of four with Bindu as the fifth is established as Vya$ti in the Pranava that expresses Siva. Intelligent one, now listen to the form of Yantra that is Sivalinga.

16-17. Beneath all, the pedestal shall be drawn; then the first vowel —A; then the letter U, the final letter of the class of Pa i e. Ma followed by Bindu and Nada. When the Yantra becomes perfect, all desires are achieved.

18. The Yantra is encompassed by the Pranava itself. The Nada shall be known through the Nada arising therefrom. O sage, shall now explain the secret topic of the deity. I shall mention it, out of my affection to you, in the manner explained by Siva.

20. Beginning with “I resort to the lord born sill of a

sudden” and concluding with “Sada Sivam” the Vedic text clearly expresses the five Brahmans.

21. The five deities shall be known comprising the subtle form of Brahman. These are enlarged in the form of the idol of Siva too.

22. The Mantra that expresses Siva expresses his idol too, since there is not much of difference between the idol and the original.

23. I have already referred to the form of Siva with Isana at the head. Now listen about his five faces.

24. Beginning with the fifth one the Sadyojata and proceeding till Isana upwards are the five faces.

25-26. The four Brahmans constitute a Caturvyuha for lord Isana, the famous Brahman. These five together constitute the composite sage, from Purusa to Sadyojata the four constitute the individual.

27. This set of five is the ‘wheel of blessing’. It is the same as Brahman. It is subtle; free from aberration and ailment.

28. The Anugraha or blessing is twofold: appearance and disappearance. The lord who bestows the greater and the lesser salvation to the souls is another.

29. This is the twofold function of Siva for ever. The five functions of creation etc. come under Anugraha.

30. O sage, there too the deities Sadya etc. are of the form of the great Brahman. The five always bestow happiness.

31. The Anugraha cakra is the greatest bliss presided over by Sadasiva. It consists of the digit beyond calmness.

32. This region is attainable by the pious ascetics who worship Sadasiva, with the minds fixed on the Pranava.

33-34. After attaining this region and enjoying vast pleasures along with the lord in the form of Brahman the sages attain equality with Siva at the advent of the great dissolution. They never fall again in the ocean of the universe.

35. The eternal Veda says “Te brahmaloke” 161 etc. The glory of Siva is the composite form itself.

36. The Vedic text Atharvasirsa says “Equipped with

161. TA. io. io. 3.



---


glory and prosperity”. The ability to bestow glory shall be mentioned of him alone.

37. There is no higher region than that of Siva. This universe is only an extension of the five Brahmans.

38. Nivftti and the Kalas are the offshoots of five Brahmans. They are in the form of subtle elements well known as causes.

39. O sage of good rites, the set of five Brahmans is the cause of gross cosmos.

40. Puru$a, ear, speech, sound and ether, this set of five is pervaded, O excellent sage, by the Brahman in the form of Hana.

41. Prakfti, skin, hand, sense of touch and wind, this set of five, O great sage, is pervaded by Brahman as Puru^a.

42. The ego, eye, foot, colour and fire, this set of five is pervaded by Aghora Brahman.

43. The intellect, tongue, arms, taste and water, this set of five is pervaded by the Brahman Vamadeva.

44. The mind, nose, organ of generation, smell and earth, this set of five is pervaded by the Brahman Sadya. The whole universe is identical with the five Brahmans.

45-46. Pranava expressive of Siva is taught through yantra. It is the composite of five letters. The four viz, Bindu etc. constitute the form of yantra in the Saiva cult. Pranava is the highest Mantra —the very Siva himself.

# CHAPTER FIFTEEN

# ( The idol of Siva for worship )

Subrahmanya said: O

1. Henceforth I shall explain, good-faced lady, the mode of creation for the set of four, Mahesa etc. from Sada£iva.

2. Sadasiva the lord of ether is the composite. The set of four, Mahe£a etc. is the individualistic form.



---


# 3.

Mahe£a is a thousandth part of SadaSiva. It has the form of Puru?a for its face. It is the lord of wind too.

# 4.

He is associated with Maya Sakti on his left. He is SagUna having much activity. The set of four l£vara etc. is his own Vyarti.

# 5.

This set of four comprising ISvara, ViSveSvara, Para-meSvara and SarveSvara is the excellent Tirobhavacakra.

# 6.

Tirobhava is twofold. One concerns Rudra, the other the individual souls in view of their physical bodies.

# 7.

The latter remains till equality in activity is achieved. When this is achieved, there remains only the lord of the form of blessing.

# 8.

There all the ISvaras who are glorified as the deities, are identical with the great Brahman itself, free from alternatives and ailments.

# 9.

The Tirobhava Gakra consists of the Santikala. This excellent region is presided over by Mahe$vara.

# 10.

This region is attainable by those who serve Mahesa etc. It yields Salokya liberation to the devotees of Mahe£vara.

# 11.

The image Rudra is born of a thousandth part of Maheivara. He has Aghora for his face. He is the lord of the principle of fire.

# 12.

He is associated with Gaurisakti on his left. He is the cause of dissolution of the universe; of him alone is the Vyasfi born — the set of four, Siva etc.

# 13.

This set of four consists of Siva, Hara, Mrda and Bhava. This wheel of dissolution, O sage, is wonderful and divine.

# 14-16.

Dissolution has been classified into three. The first Nitya is the daily slumber of living beings. The second is the conditioned dissolution of Brahma. The third is the final dissolution. The three have been indicated by the Vedic texts. O excellent sage, the dissolution has been classified into three by the illustrious Rudra for the maturing of the activities of individual souls and for their rest. The souls released from their recurring births are ultimately placed in the great Atman itself.

# 17.

Thus I have mentioned the three activities of



---


# Sivapurdna

Rudra in respect of dissolution. The five activities of the lord in respect of creation shall also be explained to you.

18. O sage, the deities Bhava etc. are identical with the great Brahman, being the cause of bliss.

19. This wheel of dissolution has Vidyarupa Kala. This healthy region is presided over by Rudra himself.

20. This region is attainable by those who desire the propitiation of Rudras. O sage, it yields the S&#x26;yujya of Rudras gradually through Salokya.

21. Visnu was born from a thousandth part of Rudra. In the form of Vamadcva wheel he is the presiding deity of the principle of water.

22. He is associated with Laksmi Sakti on the left. He is the protector of all. He has four arms. He has eyes as splendid as the lotus. He is dark-complexioned and bears the characteristics of Sarikha etc.

23. Of him alone is the set of lour Vasudcvas in the Vya$ti form. It bestows liberation on the devotees of Visnu engaged in worship through meditation.

24. This set of four consists of Vasudeva, Aniruddha, Samkarsana and Pradyumna. This excellent wheel of sustenance is well known.

25. Sustenance means the protection of the existing universe along with its creator until the completion of the pleasures of the souls, the reapers of the fruit.

26. Protection is the activity of Visnu. In the sustenance also the lord has five activities, viz; creation etc.

27. The deities of whom Pradyumna is the chief are absolute and without distress. They cause bliss to liberated souls.

28. O Brahmin, this wheel of sustenance which is permanent is presided over by Visnu. It is the highest abode.

29. This region is attainable by those who serve the lotus-feet of Vi§nu. This wheel yields Salokya etc. to the devotees of Vi$nu.

30. Brahma was born of a thousandth part of Vi?nu. He has the face of Sadyojata and is the presiding deity of the principle of earth.

31. He is accompanied by the goddess of speech on his left. He is the creator and lord of the universe. He has



---

Kail&#x26;sasarhhitd
# 1737

four faces. He is red in complexion and his form is possessed of Rajas attribute.

# 32.

Hiranyagarbha, Virat, Puru?a and Kala, the four constitute his personal form.

# 33.

O Brahmin, this wheel of creation is the cause of Brahma’s sons and other sages. It bestows desires and happiness to the devotee.

# 34-35.

Those who have the knowledge of creation know this to be the function of Brahman. Creation is the process of re-uniiication of the soul with the body previously annihilated —the body which along with the means, ancillaries and results comes out of Prakrti for gradual enjoyment. It is pleasing as long as it holds good.

# 36.

O sage, in the creation of the universe there are five functions of the lord. The present time etc. are the deities there.

# 37.

This wheel of creation is in 'the form of turning round. This charming region is presided over by Brahman.

# 38.

This region is attainable by those who have dedicated their minds to Brahma. This indeed bestows Salokya and other liberations on the devotees of Brahma.

# 39.

Even in regard to the set of four wheels the Pranava indicates Mahe£a etc.

# 40.

O sage, this wheel of universe is glorified by the Srutis. The Vedas eulogise it as the wheel with five spokes.

# 41.

Although the wheel of the universe with its five constituents: creation etc. has five spokes, it develops and increases by Siva’s energy.

# 42.

It is called a “wheel” because it moves round and round with incessant dissolution and recreation like the whirling fire-brand.

# 43-44.

Because of the immensity of creation it is called Prthu, the resultant of the Saktj of lord Siva of immense splendour and of golden features. The wheel is dependent on golden splendour and is surrounded by water encompassed by fire.

# 45.

Fire is surrounded by wind; wind by ether; ether by the primordial element and that by intellect.



---


46. Intellect is encompassed by the unmanifest. O sage, the universe is thus explained by the learned preceptors.

47. Such are the seven sheaths which protect the universe. The expanse of water is ten times more massive than the wheel.

48. O The world above is ten times more than the one below. leading sage, the universe shall be known thus by those who desire to know that.

49. It is by accepting this sense that the Sruti says "In the middle of water”. Of course the earth rotates as the wheel.

50. That Siva alone accompanied by Sakti performs incessant sports through blessing, disappearance, dissolution, sustenance and creation.

51. O sage, of what avail is much talk? I shall tell you the essence. Siva endowed with Sakti is all this. It is definite conclusion.

# CHAPTER SIXTEEN

# ( Siva's principle )

Sfita said:

1. On hearing this truthful purport enunciated by the preceptor the leading sage asked him about his doubt concerning the great Atman.

Vdmadeva said:

2-S. O lord endowed with the power of knowledge and of the form of great bliss, I have heard the sweet meaning of Pranava from your glorious lotus-like mouth and nourished intellect. My doubts have gone. O lord, Maha-sena, I ask you something else. Please listen.

4. Surely this universe from Sadagiva to a worm is reflected in male and female forms everywhere.

5. Is the eternal cause of the universe in the form of a woman, or of a man or a eunuch?

# 6.

Or is it a mixture of both or something else? There has been no decision so far. Deluded by sacred scriptures scholars argue on this point in various ways.

# 7.

The Vedas expatiating on the creation of the universe itself, Visnu, Brahma and other gods and the Siddhas do not know it.

# 8-10.

Please explain so that the views may be resolved into one conflicting truthful interpretation. We say— “I know,” “I do”. This is accepted by all. There is no dispute about this. But I have some doubts. “Is there a form of the Atman or is the Atman identical with the body, sense-organs, mind, intellect and ego? The two are the points of dispute among many.

# 11-12.

O lord, uproot this poisonous tree of doubt arising from ignorance. I shall be enlightened by you so that my mind may become the fertile ground for the growth of monistic knowledge of the Saivite cult. Lord of gods, by your benign favour I shall become wise.

Suta said:

# 13.

On hearing the enquiry of the sage full of Vedantic topics, the lord smiled a little and unfolded the secret.

Subrahmanya said:

# 14.

O sage, this very secret was narrated by Siva while goddess Amba and I listened.

# 15.

Then I was fully satiated with the drink of her breast-milk. I listened to it and I came to a decisive thought. O sage, shall sympathetically explain the same to you.

# 16.

O son, it is the greatest secret. Listen to it now.

# 17.

The arguments in the philosophical text books are extensive beginning with those on Karmans and the principle of existence. But O sage, those arguments shall be listened to with discrimination by a wise person. Then it may yield wisdom.

# 18.

You have taught many disciples. But among them



---



# Sivapurdna

who is like you? Those base persons are rotting in delusion even now, wrangling in the philosophical texts propounded by Kapila and others.

19. They indulged in insulting Siva and hence were cursed by the seven sages. Their views should not be heard because they explain false notions.

20-22. There is no scope for inference that consists of the five syllogisms. On seeing smoke they say that there is fire too. But here, O sage, the world is the object of perception. Its cause and support, the great Atman Siva must be known directly. The universe in the form of male and female is directly perceived.

23-24. The physical body consists of six sheaths. The first three are born of the parts of the mother and the other three of the parts of the father. So says the Sruti.

25. The Sruti speaks of the Brahman as having the form of existence, knowledge and bliss. The word ‘existence’ is used in order to exclude the ‘non-existent’.

26-27. The exclusion of the insentient is effected by the word sentient. Of course the word Git is used in all the three genders but it signifies here a male being. The word Cit in the feminine gender is a synonym of the word knowledge. If it is taken to mean ‘Light’, it is clear that it illuminates.

28. The pair Light and Cit is the cause of the universe. Similarly the Sat and the Cit are the causes of the universe.

29. In the self-same individual the feeling of Siva and Sakti exists. If there is dirt in the oil or the wick there may be dirt in the light too.

30. Thus dirt and inauspiciousness is seen in the funeral fire also. Sivatva is due to illusion there.

31. There is weakness in the power of Cit in the individual soul. It is to exclude it that the conception of Sakti is ever present.

32. O sage, people say in the world: he is strong, he is powerful and in the Vedas too there is a similar expression.

33. Thus the Sivatva and Saktilva is present in the

greatt Atman. The bliss from the union of Siva and Sakti is ever rising. O aiming

# 34.

Hence, sage, sinless ascetics at bliss fix their minds in Siva and attain untainted auspiciousness.

# 35.

The word Brahman in the Upanijads signifies Atman collectively. It can be traced to the root Brh to increase or grow.

# 36.

Growing in size and massiveness is ever present in Siva constituting the five Brahmans. The word Brahman denotes the universe.

# 37.

O Vamadeva, due to my affection for you I shall explain the origin of the Pranava when the word Hamsah is reverted. Listen attentively.

# 38.

If the consonants Sa and Ha are removed it becomes Om. It is the expression of the great Atman.

# 39.

It shall be known as the great Mantra by the expert sages. This great Mantra is subtle. I shall tell you its analysis.

# 40.

The great 'Mantra is formed with h and the sixteenth vowel (:) = $: and + $ with the fifteenth vowel

# 41.

It is the inverted form of Hamsa. The meaning of the letter ‘Sa’ is Siva. The conclusion is, the Sakti form is expressed by the great Mantra.

# 42-43.

At the instruction of the preceptor, the great mantra is Siva in the form of Sakti. Hence the great mantra is the individual soul too. The individual soul is in the form of Sakti and is a part of Siva. Due to the identity with Siva it attains equality with Siva. In the passage (of the Vedas) “Prajfianam Brahma” the meaning of “Prajnanam” is seen.

# 44.

Undoubtedly the word “Prajfianam” is a synonym of consciousness. O sage, there is the aphorism.

# 45.

Caitanya is the freedom in respect of the knowledge and activity of every thing in the universe. He whose nature is this is glorified as Atman.

# 46-47.

Thus a gloss on the aphorisms of Siva has been mentioned by me. In another aphorism of Siva viz; “Jfianam Bandhah” the lord speaks of the nature of



---


# StvapurSna

individual souls. There the word Jfiana refers to vague knowledge and activity.

48-49. These two (knowledge and activity) are the first throbbing of the great Sakti. It is this Para Sakti that the Svetasvataras eulogised joyously saying “Power of knowledge and activity is natural” They know the three eyes of Siva constitute knowledge, will and activity.

50. When these reaching the centre of the mind become the object of perception on the part of sense-organs the individual soul enters these, then knows and acts.

51. Hence these are the features of the Atman alone. I shall now explain then meaning of the creation indicating the identity with the Pranava.

52. The eternal Sruti says “Om is this all.” Beginning with “verily from it”, the creation of the universe is glorified.

53. I shall mention the purport of the Vedic passage. Listen to that, O Vamadeva, due to affection for you I say this. It is developed by the sense of discrimination.

54-55. It is certain that the union of Siva and Sakti is the great-Atman. From Parasakti is born the citsakti. Born of it is the power of bliss. The power of will is born of that. From this is born the power of knowledge and from this is born the power of activity, the fifth one. O sage, the Kalas— Nivrtti etc. are born of these Saktis.

56-57. Nada and Bindu are born of cit and Ananda Saktis. O sage, the letter ‘ma⁵ is born of Icchasakti. The fifth vowel -LP is born of Juana Sakti and the letter £ A’ is born of Kriyasakti. The origin of the Pranava has been mentioned thus. Now listen to the origin of the five Brahmans.

58. From Siva is born Isana; from Isana the Purusa, from Purusa Aghora, from him Vamadeva and from him Sadyojata.

59-60. From these matras (of the pranava) are born the thirty eight Kalas, Santyatitakala is born of Isana; Santikala of Purusa; Vidyakala of Aghora; Pratistha and Nivrtti of Vamadeva and Sadyojata. There are five pairs such as Isana and cit-sakli etc.



---

Kailasasamhita
61. This set of five is the cause of activities such as Anugraha etc. as mentioned by the sages who know the principles. O elements beginning with the sage, the five ether are born of this set of five letters of the Pranava which constitute pairs based on the relationship of the word and its meaning.

62-63. Akasa has the only attribute of sound. The wind has the two: sound and touch. The fire has three: sound, touch and colour.

64. The water has four: sound, touch, colour and taste. The earth has five: sound, touch, colour, taste and smell.

65. This is the Vyapakatva (pervasiveness) of the Bhutas. The Vyapakatva is in the inverse order beginning with smell.

66. The five Bhutas constitute the universe. Virat is the composite form of all. The universe is thus created.

67. It begins with the element of the earth and ends with the element of Siva. After merging with each other they merge in the individual soul ultimately.

68. Accompanied by the energy it comes out again for the purpose of creation. It appears in the form of the gross cosmos and functions till the period of dissolution.

69. The primeval oozing of Siva who attempts to create the universe at his will is called Sivatatlva.

70. In view of its conformity with the activities this alone becomes the principle of his power of will. Between the two Saktis of knowledge and activity if the knowledge predominates, the principle is Sadasiva.

71. O sage, know that as Mahesvara Taltva when the activity is predominant. If there is equality between the two Saktis know that as the form of pure knowledge.

72-73. After withdrawing his form of great glory with the intellect comprehending the difference between the illusion and reality among various emotions in the form of his own part when Siva becomes the recipient of all objects through illusion, he is called Purusa, the creator. The Vedic text says “Talsrstva” (after creating it).

SivapurSnA
75. He is transformed as the individual soul deluded by Maya and devoid of the knowledge of Siva. His intellect is deluded by different activities.

76. It is the individual soul that is deluded and not the lord. Because the former considers himself different from Siva.

77. As the magician so also the Yogin has no illusion. Siva is of perfect knowledge and this is revealed by the preceptor.

78-79. The five Saklis of Siva are: activity, knowledge, completeness, eternality and pervasiveness. Even in their shrinking forms they shine always.

80-81. There is a set of five Tattvas of the individual soul, viz, Kala, Vidya, Raga, Kala and Niyati. Kala is the cause of doing anything. Vidya is the means of certain Tattvas. Raga is the attachment to the sense-objects.

82. Kala is the illuminator of positive and negative appearances. Being a separating factor it is called Bhutadi.

83. Niyati means the factor that discriminates and ordains. “This shall be done and this shall not be done by me.” It is a Sakti of the lord. Setting it at nought the individual soul falls.

81. This set of five is called “the five sheaths” in view of its nature of enveloping the form. It is the innermost and most essential means.

# chapter seventeen

# (The non-dualistic nature of Siva)

Vdmadeva said: —

1-2. You have mentioned before 162 that the Purusa is placed beneath the Niyati and is above Prakrti. How is it that you say now that it shrinks in form through Maya and 162. Kailasa S. 13 31-

is beneath it. O lord, it behoves you to clear this doubt of mine.

# Subrahmanya said:

1. This is the Saivite philosophy of non-dualism. Nowhere does it brook duality. Duality perishes and the non-dualism remains imperishable.
2. The omniscient, omnipotent, Siva, the Nirguna lord of all, the progenitor of the three deities, the Brahman, is formed of existence-knowledge-bliss.
3. That lord Siva himself, out of his own will, through his own Maya appears shrinking in size and becomes Puru§a.
4. He is conceived as the enjoyer through the set of five Kalas etc. Thus the Purusa stationed in Prakrti enjoys the Gunas born of Prakrti.
5. The presence in two places of the Purusa is not incompatible. He is the composite of Jnana etc. of both shrinking and intrinsic forms.
6. The principle of the mind Prakrti consists of Buddhi, Manas and Ahamkara achievable through the Gunas Sattva etc. The Gunas are born of the Prakrti, the Sattvaic from Sattva and so on. From the Gunas the intellect takes its origin. It is the cause of decisiveness in the objects.
7. From Buddhi the principle of intellect is born and from it ego. From the ego the sense-organs of knowledge. The mind has two aspects — thought and doubt.
8. The sense-organs are ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose and the qualities particularly sensed through those organs are sound, touch, colour, taste and smell. The Tanmatras are born from the Vaikarika Ahamkara.
9. They are called subtle principles by the sages. Now understand the organs of activity and their functions.
10. O sage, they are the organs of speech, hand, feet, anus, penis and the vaginal passage. Their functions are speaking, handling, moving, evacuation and the sexual pleasure.
11. The subtle elements originated in order from the

16. From them arc born in order the ether, wind, fire, water and the earth. O sage, they are known as the five elements.

17. Their functions are giving space, blowing, cooking, force and supporting.

Viimadeva said:

18. O Skanda, you have mentioned before that the elements were created from Kalas etc. How is it that it is being mentioned in another manner? I have great doubt here.

19. “The letter ‘A’ is the Atmatattva; the letter ‘U’ is ‘Vidya; the letter ‘Ma’ is Sivatattva. O Vamadeva let this be thought over thus.

20. “The Bindu and Nada have essence of all the principles. O sage, listen now to what the deities therein are.

21. They are Brahma, Visnu, Rudra, Mahcsvara and Sadasiva. They are the images of Siva himself well known in the Vedas.

22. This is what you have said before. Now you say in another manner that they are born of the subtle elements. I have a great doubt in this matter.

23. Therefore, O Skanda, it behoves you to favour me by clearing the doubt. On hearing the words of the sage, Kumfira replied thus.

Subrahmanya said:

24-26. O intelligent sage, listen with respect and attention. Sage, in accordance with the Vedic text “Tasmad Vai Etasmad” etc. it is certain that the five Bhutas are born of the Kalas. They are in the form of the gross cosmos. This explains the body of the lord of Bhutas (Siva). In the order of the coming up of the Tattvas from Siva Tattva to the principle of the earth, O sage, they shall be mentioned as originating from the subtle elements in order.

The deities Brahma, Viṣnu, Maheṣa and others, the various living beings, Indra and other guardians of the quarters, gods, Pitṛs, Asuras, Rākṣasas, human and other mobile beings, beasts, birds, worms, serpents, trees, hedges, creepers and herbs, the eight mountains,¹ *8 the seven rivers4*4 Ganga and others, the oceans of great prosperity whatever object is there in the world all are established here.

33. This universe of the form of female and male, of the form of Siva and Sakti shall deserve attention of learned men like you, experts in the Saiva knowledge.

34. O sage, the Sruti says “Think that everything is Brahman, everything is Rudra.” Thus Sadaśiva is the Atman of the universe.

35. Due to the concept of thirty-eight Kalas the concept of duality is ever present but he who has purified the Atman by the concept “I am Sadaśiva” becomes the preceptor Siva.

36. Such a disciple becomes the preceptor Siva himself. He attains the form of the Yantra, mantra and the cosmic deity itself.

37. O Brahmin, the disciple whose bondage is severed due to the favour of the preceptor and who is engaged in Siva’s worship becomes a lofty soul indeed.

38. They say that whatever exists whether a composite unit or an analysed piece is the meaning of the Pranava in view of the predominance of the Gunas.

It is pleasing to Siva, it is devoid of aberrations; it is the essence of the Vedas.

40-41. If anyone whether a god or a human being, Siddha or Gandharva, out of arrogance considers this statement otherwise, I shall cut off his head evenly with my good trident which is like a black fire to the enemies.

42. O sage, you yourself are the most excellent of those who know the non-dualistic nature of Siva. You are the guide for good behaviour on the occasion of the instruction of Saivite knowledge.

43. An impious ghost got his sins removed by the contact with the ashes on your body. By your grace he attained the supreme goal.

44. You are a Siva yogin, an asset to the three worlds. At your benign glance even the individual soul becomes the supreme soul.

45. It is for instructing the world that a noble soul as yourself look up to me with respect. Indeed the saints wander here and there for helping the wide world.

46-47. This great secret is founded in you. You too, abide by the Pranavas alone with respect, faith and devotion and unite them with ParameSvara helping people grasp Saivite conduct including Bhasma and Rudraksa.

48. You are Siva indeed. You follow Saivite conduct and have understood the concept of non-dualism. Wandering about for the welfare of the world you will attain an everlasting happiness.

# ( The procedure of initiating a disciple)

Saunaka said:

1. On hearing that extremely wonderful secret, the essence of the Vedanta, what did Vamadeva ask of the son of Mahe£vara?
2. Blessed indeed is the Yogin Vamadeva, who is ever engaged in Saivite activities and about whom this divine and highly sacred story has come about.
3. On hearing these words, pregnant with love, of the sages, the delighted Suta, the scholar whose mind is attached to Siva, spoke to them.
4. You are all blessed. You are the devotees of lord Siva. You help all the worlds, O sages, you hear further their conversation.
5. On hearing the words of Karttikeya, that quell dualism and produce non-dualistic knowledge the sage became delighted.
6. After bowing to Karttikeya, son of Siva and eulogising him in various ways the great sage asked him again regarding the principles, with great humility.

Vamadeva said:

O lord Karttikeya, O ocean of nectar, O knower of all principles, how can the ascetics of purified souls attain the position of a preceptor?
They cannot have the authority to instruct without a tradition following which the individual souls attain worldly pleasures and salvation.
Similarly how is the ceremonial ablution an ancillary to the rite of shaving? Lord, herein I intimate to you this doubt of mine. It behoves you to clear it.

Subrahmanya said:

On hearing the words of Vamadeva Karttikeya began to explain after thinking upon Siva and Siva.
I shall explain Yogapatfa whereby one attains the state of a preceptor. It is a great secret that yields salvation and O Vamadeva, it is due to my affection to you that I mention it to you.

# (The rules of Togapaffa)

Subrahmanya said: — Now the great statements: perfect knowledge is Brahman; I am Brahman; thou art that. This Atman is Brahman. All this is pervaded by the lord. I am the vital breath. Atman is perfect knowledge; what is here is there; what is there is here. It is other than what is known; verily it is other than what is unknown too. This is your soul, the immanent and the deathless one. He who is in this



---

Kaildsasarhhitd
Purta$a and he who is in the sun both are the same. I am the great Brahman, the greatest, greater than the greatest. I am myself (the Brahman) characterised by bliss, since I am the master of the Vedas and the Sastras. Brahman is stationed in all living beings. Undoubtedly I am that alone. I am the vital breath of the elements: of the earth, of the waters, of the fire, of the wind, of the ether and of the three Gunas. I am all. I am the Atman of all. I transmigrate. I am without a second because I have everything in my Atman—past, present and future. Indeed all this is Brahman. I am all. I am the liberated. He who is this is I; I am he; I am Hamsa; I am he. This shall be meditated upon always and everywhere.

1. The meaning of the statement “Perfect knowledge is Brahman” has already been made known. Paramesvara the Sakti-soul is the meaning of the word Aham.
2. ‘A’ is the foremost among all letters. It is the greatest splendour ‘Siva’. The letter Ha is of the form of firmament. It is glorified as the Sakti-soul.
3. Bliss is ever-rising due to the union of Siva and Sakti. The word Brahman indicates the state of being Atman of all, of Siva and Sakti.
4. That has been taught before. The devotee shall meditate “I am he” “That you are;” in this the meaning of “That” has already been explained.
5. Otherwise there is a likelihood of opposite conception in “I am he” whereas the word “I” is in the masculine, the word “That” is in the neuter. Hence due to the incompatibility they cannot be interpreted together. The cause of the universe, of male and female forms, cannot be otherwise. The concept of the meaning of the instruction is: “Thou art that.”
6. In the statement “This Atman is Brahman” both the words are in the masculine. All this worthy of protection is pervaded by the lord.
7. “The Atman is the perfect knowledge: what is here is there; he who is here is there.” The concept is very well interpreted by the scholars.
8. In the statement “It is other than what is



---


1754 Sivapur&#x26;na

known and what is unknown*’, there is a likelihood of adverse interpretation and conception in regard to the fruit of salvation. I shall explain, O sage, how this misinterpretation shall be prevented. “What is known” means “what is known not properly.” What is unknown” means ”What is not known before.” Otherwise the expression may not be conducive to any meaning.

13-14. "This is your soul, the immanent, and the immortal one.” It is Siva himself, who is in the Purusa, or in the sun. Here the two conditions indicate that there is no separateness in the lord.

15-17. Verily the Vedas mention lord Siva as golden. “Golden-armed” refers to his limbs being golden. Otherwise the lordship cannot be his. In the Chandogya also in the passage “He who is in Siva” is mentioned with golden moustache, golden tresses. Everywhere from the nail till the hair he is golden.

18. I shall tell you me purport of the statement “I am the great Brahman”. Please listen.

19. The meaning of 'Aham' is Sakti-soul. Siva is indicated thereby. “I am he alone”. The statement can be construed thus.

20-21. He is mentioned as the great Brahman, most sublime and the soul of all: “Para, Apara, Paratpara.” The words Rudra, Brahma and Visnu arc mentioned in the Vedas. The lord is greater than these. This is indicated by the word ‘Para’.

22. By pondering over and practising the words of the Vedas, Sastras and the preceptor, Siva, the blissful lord appears in the heart of the pupil.

23. Siva is stationed in all living beings. Undoubtedly I am he. I am the vital breath of all the Tattvas. I am Siva.

* 24-26. After mentioning the Tattvas the Sastras mention the Tattvas and Gunas severally. The statement “I am the vital breath of all”, O sage, includes the principles in entirety. By saying “I am all” he means “I am the vital breath of the Vidvatattva and the Tattvas of Siva and Atman.”

Hence “I am the Atman of all. Since the individual soul is immanent as well, I am his Jiva always.

27. What is past, what is yet to be, what is present - all these are identical with me. Hence I am all. All is Rudra. O the sage, Sruti says that it has originated from Siva’s mouth. “I am the soul of all”, because the great qualities are ever present in me.

28. "I am without a second” because there is no other Atman distinct from the self. The statement “indeed all this is Brahman” has been explained before.

before his preceptor, the preceptor’s preceptor and the other disciples of his preceptor.

51. When the disciple has finished the customary obeisance he shall stand humbly and silently like a well behaved disciple. The preceptor shall tell him like this.

52. "From now onwards be engaged in blessing the worlds. Accept a disciple only after testing him for a year. Accept him duly.

53. Eschew the faults of lust etc. and be devoted to meditation on Siva. Associate with those who have inherited good tradition and not with others.

When they forbid him follow further, he shall return and take food along with the other brahmins, kinsmen and the poor. He shall then feel contented and happy.

24. This is never affected. It is the truth. He who performs the rite of propitiation of the preceptor every year enjoys great pleasure here and attains Sivaloka hereafter.

25. After saying this to Vfimadeva his disciple blessed by himself, the wise lord Subrahmanya delighted in mind said:

26. Since formerly this was mentioned to the sages of the Naimisa forest by the sage Vyasa he is our first preceptor. You are the second one famous in the world.

27. Hearing this from the loin-like mouth of yours the great sage Sanatkumara, full of devotion to Siva, shall mention this to Vyasa. That excellent devotee of Siva will mention this to Suka.

28. For every leading sage there will be four disciples. They will be masters of Vedic study and establish virtuous sacred rites.

29. The four disciples of Vyasa are Vanainpayana, Paila, Jaimini and Sumantu.

30. O sage Vamadeva, your disciples are Agasiy a, Pulasya, Pulaha and Kratu.

31-32. Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatanamuni, and Sanatsujjla, these great yogins, favourites of Siva, the knowers of the Vedas are the disciples of Sanatkumara. Thus these preceptors, great preceptors etc. are worthy of being worshipped by the yogin Suka.

33. This perfect knowledge of Pranava is well established in the four classes of disciples. Being the cause of great glory it is the cause of salvation at Ka*I.

34. This Manqlala as the seat of the great Siva is wonderful. It is worshipped by the great sages conversant with the essence of Vedanta. It is enveloped by the ether as mentioned in the Vedas. May it be conducive to your satisfaction and the welfare of the world. May it yield glory and prosperity.

35. This is the secret par excellence as mentioned by Siva. It is the conclusion of the Vedanta tenet. O sage, since it has been heard by you from me people call it as your tenet.

36. Hence an ascetic who treads along this path attains Siva like the rivers that fall into the sea. By the repeated practice of the meditation “I am Siva”, the ascetic becomes Siva. He can grant salvation even to the class of beings Brahma etc.

37-38. After teaching this to the sage the lord of gods remembered the lotus-like feet of his parents worshipped by the gods. Kumara reached Kailasa of many peaks, Kumara the preceptor who bestows perfect knowledge.

39. Accompanied by his disciples and making obeisance to the peacock-vehicled lord, Vamadeva too immediately left for the wonderful mountain Kailasa.

40. After reaching the summit of Kailasa the sage approached Siva. He saw the feet of the lord and the goddess—the feet that bestow salvation and destroy illusion.

41. With great devotion he dedicated himself to him. He prostrated again and again and then got up.

42. Then the sage, with various Vedic and Sastric hymns eulogised Siva together with Amba and their sons.

43. He put the lotus-like feet of the lord and the goddess on his head. With their blessings he stayed there comfortably.

44-45. All of you too shall learn the meaning of the Pranava Mahesvara, the secret of the Vedas, of the Taraka Brahman, the bestower of salvation. Remaining here itself

# CHAPTER ONE 178

# (Origin of the sacred lore)

Vyiisa said:

1. Obeisance to Siva accompanied by Uma, Ganas and his sons, the lord of Prakrti and Ptirusa and the cause of creation, sustenance and annihilation.

2-3. I seek refuse in Siva, whose power is unequalled, whose glory spreads everywhere, whose lordship and potency are said to be natural, who is unborn, who is the creator of the universe, eternal, auspicious and the unchanging great Atman.

4-5. Noble sages engaged in truthful rites, highly fortunate and dignified performed a great sacrifice in the Naimisa 179 forest, a virtuous spot and a holy centre of many sacrifices at the confluence 180 of the Gariga and Kuliridi, a pathway that leads to Biahmaloka. 181

6-9. On hearing that the sages of good rites were performing the sacrifice, Suta the most excellent of Pauranikas came to that place, Suta who was a noble disciple of the intelligent Veda Vyasa the son of Satyavatl, who was very intelligent and famous in the world, who knew the faults and merits of syllogistic statements. He could satisfy even the queries of Brhaspati. He was an expert in narrating the stories of charming anecdotes. He knew the proper time for everything and the policy to be adopted. He was a poet.

10. On seeing Suta come, the sages were delighted.

in their minds. They received him and worshipped him suitably.

11. Accepting their welcome and worship he took the proper seat offered by them.

12. By their contact with him the sages of pious souls became eager and impatient to hear the Puranic lore.

13. Worshipping him with words of praise the sages sat in front of him and spoke.

14. O omniscient Romaharsana, the principal devotees of Siva of great fortune and keen intellect, it is due to the weightiness of our good luck that you have come here now.

15-17. You have directly acquired the Puranic lore from Vyasa, Hence you are a repository of wonderful tales, even as the ocean of precious gems. There is nothing in the three worlds past, present or future, which is not known to you. Fortunately you have come here to visit us. It does not behove you to go in vain without conferring blessing on us.

18. Please narrate to us the holy Purana the storehouse of good stories and the essence of the Vedanta.

19. Thus I requested by the sages, the habitual reciters of the Vedic texts, Suta spoke auspicious words full of sweet and rational meaning.

Suta said:

20. I have been honoured, blessed and urged by you all. Why shall I not then expound clearly the Purana, held in esteem by the sages.

21-22. After saluting Siva, Parvati, Skanda, Genosa, Nandin and Vyasa the son of Satyavali, I shall narrate the extremely meritorious Purana which is on a par with the Vedas, which being an ocean of Saivite knowledge directly yields worldly pleasures and salvation.

23. It is embellished with the topics of the Agamas full of rational meaning. In the context of the Sveta Kalpa 182 it was narrated by Vayu formerly.

24. Understand well even as I narrate the various sacred lores, the due order of the Puranas and their origin.

25. The sacred lore consists of fourteen texts viz., the

182. On Kalpa see P. 1070 note.

1 776 Sivapur&#x26;na

six Aiigas, the four Vedas, Mimamsa, Nyaya, Puranas and the Dharma Sastras.

26. There are eighteen secular Vidyas Ayurveda Dhanurveda, Gandharvaveda etc. ending with Arthasastra.

27. Sruti mentions that the original exponent and poet of the eighteen Vidyas, each having its own individual path, is the trident-bearing lord himself.

28. Indeed he is the lord of the universe. At the outset, with the desire of creating the universe, he created Brahma, as his son.

29. To his eldest son Brahma, the cause of the universe, Siva gave these lores in the beginning in order to facilitate the creation of the universe.

30. He created Visnu for the protection, of even Brahma himself and endowed him with the power of protection.

31. Purana, the first among the Sastras, was learnt by Brahma who had acquired the lore and began the creation of the subjects.

32. The Vedas came out of his mouths. The Sastras too had their origin from him.

33-34. When the people could not follow the big sacred texts, at the instance of Visvesvara, lord Visnu the sustainer and the soul of the universe incarnated on the earth at the end of Dvapara Yuga, in order to abridge them. He walked about the earth in the name of Vyasa.

35. O Brahmins, in every Dvapara Yuga the Vedas are classified by him. The Puranas and other texts are written by him.

36. In this Dvapara age he was born of Satyavati in the name of Krsnadvaipayana as fire from Arani.

37. He abridged and classified the Vedas into four groups. He is known as Vedavyasa.

38. Puranas extending to a hundred crore Slokas were condensed by him into four hundred thousand Slokas. Even now in the Devaloka they have the original number.

39. Even if a brahmin knows the four Vedas with their Angas and the Upanisads he is not an expert if he does not know the Puranas.

40. The knowledge of the Vedas shall he enlarged by



---

Vayaviyasarhhitd
Itihasa and the Puranas. The Vedas are afraid of a man of deficient knowledge thinking “This man will deceive me”.

1. Puranas have five characteristics—creation, subsidiary creation, genealogy, manvantaras and the chronological account of kings, these are described in every Purana.
2. The sages reckon ten Puranas and eight big Puranas.
3. Brahma, Padma, Vaisnava, Saiva, Bhagavata, Bhavisya, Naradlya and Markandeya are the eight big Puranas.
4. Agneya, Brahmavaivarta, Linga, Varaha, Skanda, Vamana, Kurma, Matsya, Garuda and Brahmanda are the ten small Puranas. These are the eighteen Puranas in order. Sivapurana, the fourth in the list belongs to Siva and is conducive to the achievement of all objects.
5. It contains a hundred thousand verses. It is divided into twelve Samhitas. It is created by Siva. All sacred rites are mentioned therein.
6. Men are classified under three castes in accordance with their duties. Hence he who wishes for liberation shall resort to Siva alone.
7. Even the gods can attain liberation by resorting to him alone and not otherwise.
8. What I mentioned as the Sivapurana on a par with the Vedas, know its creations as I briefly explain.
9. There are twelve Samhitas: Vidyesvara, Rudra, Vainayaka, Auma, Matr, Rudraikadasaka, Kailasa, Satarudra, Kotirudra, Sahasi akotirudra, Vayavlya and Dharmapurana. Vidyesvara contains ten thousand verses. There are eight thousand verses in each of the four—Raudra, Vainayaka, Auma and Matrpurana. Rudraikadasa contains thirteen thousand verses; Kailasa six thousand; Satarudra three thousand; Kotirudra nine thousand; Sahasrakotirudra eleven thousand; Vayavlya four thousand and Dharma contains twelve thousand verses.
10. Thus Sivapurana contains a thousand verses.

On the characteristic nomenclature and number of the Puranas see Introduction to Vol. I.



---


This Parana, the essence of the Vedas, yields worldly pleasures and salvation.

# 58.

Siva Parana the fourth one was abridged into seven Sarhhitas with twenty four thousand verses.

# 59-60.

The first Sarhhita is Vidyesvara; the second Rudrasamhita; the third Satarudra. Kotirudra is the fourth. Umasarhhita is the fifth; the sixth is Kailasa. The seventh is Vayavlya. These are only seven compendiums.

# 61-64.

Vidyesvara contains two thousand verses, Rudra ten thousand five hundred; Satarudra two thousand one hundred and eighty; Kotirudra two thousand two hundred and forty; Uma one thousand eight hundred and forty; Kailasa one thousand two hundred and forty and the Vayavlya four thousand verses. Thus is the holy text of Sivapurana.

# 65.

I shall now begin the Vayavlya containing four thousand verses and consisting of two parts.

# 66.

This excellent Sastra shall not be mentioned to one who is not conversant with the Vedas nor to one who has no faith nor to one who does not know the Puranas.

# 67.

It shall be given to a tested virtuous disciple uncontaminated by malice. He shall be a devotee of Siva and a follower of the Saiva cult.

# 68.

Obeisance to the holy sage Vyasa of brilliant splendour whose grace has endowed me with the Puranic lore.

# CHAPTER TWO

# (The problem of the sages)

Suta said:

# 1-3.

When a long time had elapsed, many kalpas had come and gone, the present kalpa had started, the activity of creation had begun, and the customs among the enlightened subjects had become established, a dispute arose among the sages of six clans. One said “This is the greatest being.”



---

Vayaviyasarhhitd
Another said, “It is not.* Because the greatest being could not be reviewed or defined no conclusion was arrived at.

4. In order to see the eternal creator they went where the lord was staying eulogised by gods and Asuras.

5-6. It was on the auspicious and charming peak of Meru, where there were plenty of gods and Asuras where Siddhas and Caranas thronged, where Yaksas and Gandharvas frequented, where flocks of birds chirped and crew, which was embellished by jewels and corals and which shone due to streams and rivulets, caves and crevices, bushes and hedges.

7-8. There was a forest Brahmavana which abounded in different species of deer. It was ten Yojanas wide and hundred Yojanas long. There were beautiful lakes full of sweet and clean water. It had plenty of trees in full bloom where swarms of bees hummed and hovered.

9. This was a great city as beautiful and brilliant as the midday sun. It could not be attacked by the haughty Daityas, Danavas and Raksasas.

10. It had lofty ramparts and portals made of molten gold. It was embellished by hundreds of main streets, turrets and wooden cci lines.

11. It appeared to lick the sky with crores of huge mansions set with precious gems of variegated colours. It was decorated with many such mansions.

12-13. Lord Brahma resides there along with his councillors. Going there the sages saw the lord, the noble Atman served by the groups of gods and sages. He was shining like pure gold. He was bedecked in all ornaments.

14. He was gentle with delightful face. His eyes were as large as the petals of a lotus. He was endowed with a divine lustre. He had smeared divine unguents and scents.

15. He was clad in brilliant white garments. He was bedecked in divine garlands. His lotus-like feet were saluted by the gods, Asuras and leading yogins.

16. Accompanied by Sarasvati whose body had all auspicious marks who held the chowrics in her hands, he shone as the sun with his dazzling light.

Sivapur&#x26;na

17. On seeing him the sages were delighted and their eyes and faces shone. With palms joined in reverence and held over their heads they eulogised the leading god.

The sages said:

18. Obeisance to you in the form of Trinity, the cause of creation, sustenance and annihilation, the ancient Purusa, Brahma the great Atman.

19. Obeisance to the deity who has Prakrti for his body, who is the cause of quickening Pradhana, who though transformed into twentythree principles is yet free from aberration.

20. Obeisance to the deity who has universe for his body, who is stationed within the belly of the universe, who has accomplished his task and whose body is perfectly accomplished.

21. Obeisance to the deity identical with the world, the creator, the sustainer and the annihilator of the world.

22. O Brahma, it is by you alone that the entire universe is created, sustained and annihilated. Still, due to illusion, O lord, we do not know you.

Suta said:

23. Thus eulogised by the fortunate sages, Brahma spoke to the sages in a majestic tone delighting them.

Brahma said:

24. O blessed sages of great splendour and strength, why have you come here all together?

25. The sages foremost of those who know Brahman spoke with palms joined in reverence, with words couched in humility to lord Brahma who spoke thus.

The sages said:

26. O lord, we have been encompassed in deep darkness. We are distressed. Unable to understand the greatest being we are arguing among ourselves.

27. Indeed you are the creator of the universe. You are the cause of all causes. O lord, there is nothing here not known to you.



---


28. Who is that being more ancient than all living beings? Who is the greatest Purusa? Who is the purest, perfect, and eternal Being?

29. Who by indulging in wonderful activities has created the universe? O intelligent lord, please mention it and quell our doubts.

30-31. Thus questioned, Brahma, with smiling eyes, stood up and meditated for long in the presence of the gods, Danavas and sages. Uttering the words “Rudra” he joined his palms in reverence, with a blissful sensation moistening his body and spoke.

# CHAPTER THREE

# (The Naimifa episode)

Brahma said:

1-4. Siva stationed in the middle of the ether shall be meditated upon by those desirous of salvation; Siva from whom the words recede not approaching him along with the mind; knowing and realising whose bliss-form one has no fear from anywhere; from whom everything inclusive of Brahma, Visnu, Rudra, Indra, the elements, the sense-organs, is born at first, who is the creator, meditator and ultimate cause of all causes; who is not born from anything else at any time; who is endowed with glory and prosperity and who is known as SarveSvara.

5. It was he who created me at the outset as his son and gave me perfect knowledge. It was due to his grace that the lordship of the people was attained by me.

6. He is the lord who stands in heaven like the lofty stump of a tree; and by whom, by the Purusa, the great Atman, all this is filled up.

7. He is active among the inactive creatures; he who being single himself creates many is Mahesvara.

186. TU 2. 9,



---



# 8.</h8>
He rules over all the worlds through the Jlvas. He is the only lord Rudra. Thrre is none second to him.

# 9.</h8>
Though he has entered and is ever present in the hearts of the people he is invisible to others; he occupies and views at the universe always.

# 10.</h8>
He is the sole lord of infinite Sakti who presides over all causes and is released from Time —Death.

# 11.</h8>
He has neither day nor night; neither equals nor superiors. The great knowledge and activity is innate in him.

# 12.</h8>
That which is perishable and unmanifest, that which is imperishable and immortal —both these have the imperishable as their Atman. The sole lord is Siva himself.

# 13.</h8>
By concentrating on him, the person of Sattvaic feelings becomes the lord himself. At the end the universal illusion recedes from him.

# 14.</h8>
The eternal Sruti says “In whom neither the lightning flashes nor the sun blazes nor the moon sheds light and by whose brilliance this universe comes in the limelight.”

# 15.</h8>
That lord Siva shall be realised. There is no other region greater than his worthy of attainment.

# 16.</h8>
He is the cause. He has no beginning, no end. He is naturally pure, independent and perfect. The mobile and immobile beings are subservient to his will.

# 17.</h8>
His body is not the creation of PrakrG. He is glorious, devoid of examples and definitions. He is both the liberated and liberator. He is not influenced by Time. He is the activiser of time.

# 18.</h8>
He has taken up residence above all. He is the repository of all. He is the knower of all. He is the lord of the universe comprising the sixfold path.

# 19.</h8>
He is the Being above all beings, one above the other. There is no being above him. He is the bee imbibing the honey of endless bliss.

# 20.</h8>
He is an expert in solidifying the unsevered cosmic eggs. He is the ocean of benevolence, prowess, majesty and sweetness.

# 21.</h8>
There is no object equal to him or excelling him. He stands as the unparalleled Emperor of all living beings.



---


# 22.

The universe is created by him indulging in wonderful activities. At the time of dissolution this gets dissolved in him.

# 23.

The living beings are under his control. He is the employer of all. He is seen by great devotion and not otherwise.

# 24.

Sacred rites, charitable gifts, penances and observances, these are advocated by people for the purification of emotions. There is no doubt in this.

# 25.

Visnu, I, Rudra, gods and Asuras are desirous of seeing him even today by performing great penances.

# 26.

He is invisible to fallen wicked men, the despicable and the stupid. He is worshipped within and without by devotees and can be spoken to.

# 27-28.

Forms in the universe are threefold—the gross, subtle and that which is beyond. The gross is seen by us, the gods and others. The subtle is seen by the yogins. That which is beyond the two, is eternal, knowledge, bliss and the unchanging can be seen by those who dwell in it, are devoted to it and are engaged in the rites concerning it.

# 29.

Of what avail is much talk? Devotion to Siva is the secret of secrets. He who is endowed with it becomes liberated. There is no doubt in this.

# 30.

Devotion is the result of grace and grace is the result of devotion just as the sprout comes out of the seed and produces the seed.

# 31.

The achievements of the individual are due to the grace of God. Lord alone is achieved in the end through all the means.

# 32.

Virtue and holy rites constitute the means for the attainment of grace. That is indicated by the Vedas. By practising Dharma the sins and merits are levelled to equality. Contact with grace yields excellence of Dharma.

# 33.

After attaining this excellence the sins of the individual decline.

# 34.

When his sins decline through succession of births the devotion to Sarvesvara and Amba is generated along with knowledge.



---


# 35.

The grace of the lord varies in accordance with the purity of emotions. Due to grace, eschewment of rites results. Here the eschewment is of the fruits of rites and not the rites themselves.

# 36.

As a result of the abandonment of the desire for the fruits of holy rites, the auspicious Saivite virtues are attained. This is twofold: that dependent on the preceptor and that which is not.

# 37.

That which is dependent on the preceptor is more important and hundred times more efficacious since in the Saivite creed there is an association of Saivite knowledge.

# 38.

In view of the knowledge the man sees the defects in the worldly existence. Thereafter arises non-attachment to the sensual objects and thence Bhava is attained.

# 39.

When Bhava is attained the man becomes more inclined towards meditation than towards rituals. A man endowed with knowledge and meditation becomes engaged in Yoga.

# 40.

Through Yoga arises the great devotion and then grace of God. By means of the grace the creature is liberated and becomes equal to Siva.

# 41.

The different modes of blessings may not be in the order mentioned. The blessing is based on the ability of the man.

# 42.

Some soul is liberated even while in the womb; another even while being born; a third whether he be a boy or a youth or an old man.

# 43.

A soul born as a lower species, a soul undergoing torture in hell, a soul achieving a heavenly region may be liberated when the tenure is over.

# 44.

Some soul may return after the enjoyment of heavenly region and then liberated. Still another soul may be liberated on its way.

# 45.

Hence there is no stipulated mode or order in the attainment of liberation. The supreme bliss is in accordance with the knowledge and emotion and attained by the grace of the lord.

# 46-48.

Hence, in order to win his grace you shall avoid verbal and mental defects; meditate on Siva alone along with your wives, sons and others; abide by him; be.

attached to him. You shall associate with him, resort to him, do holy rites with your minds fixed in him, continue a long sacrifice for a thousand divine years. At the end of the sacrifice due to the efficacy of the mantras' Vayu will come there.

49-50. He will tell you what is good for you along with the means. Then you shall go to the holy and auspicious city of Varanasi where the glorious trident-bearing lord sports about with the goddess for blessing his devotees.

51. O excellent brahmins, after seeing the great wonder therein you come to me again. Then I shall tell you the means of salvation.

52. Thereby in a single birth, salvation comes within your reach, salvation which sets you free from the bondage of births and transmigrations.

53. Now I am releasing this mentally created wheel. The place where its rim gets shattered is auspicious for your penance.

54. After saying this Brahma created a mental wheel as bright as the sun. After bowing to lord Siva he released it.

55. Those delighted brahmins bowed to the lord and pursued the wheel to the place where its rim got shattered.

56. The wheel thus hurled fell on a smooth charming rock in a certain forest where the water was sweet and clear.

57. That forest became famous as Naimi§a. It is worshipped by the sages. It abounds in Yaksas, Gandharvas, and Vidyadharas.

58-59. Indulging in sexual dalliance with Urvasi, Pururavas was moving about in the eighteen islands in the ocean. Urged by fate he came to this place and foolishly spoiled the golden sacrificial altar here. The infuriated sages hurled Kusa grass at him which had the power of thunderbolt and felled him to the ground.

60. Formerly the Visvasrja Brahmesa householders desirous of creating the universe began a divine sacrifice here.

61. There had been many scholarly sages here experts



---


in words, meanings and logical arguments. They performed rites by their power of intellect and yogic practice.

62. Here persons well-versed in the Vedas refute those who are excluded from Vedic path by their power of arguments. They speak eloquently.

63. This Naimisa forest was the fitting place for the penance of the sages. It was beautiful with nectarine clear water flowing from the bottom rocks of the crystalline mountain. It abounded in fruit-bearing trees and was free from beasts of prey.

# CHAPTER FOUR

# (The advent of Vayu)

SGta said:

1. The fortunate sages of devout rites worshipped lord Siva and began their sacrifice there.
2. The sacrifice of the sages functioned evoking wonder in everyone like that of the ViSvasrjas formerly who were desirous of creating the universe.
3. After sometime when the Satra had concluded with the distribution of manifold gifts Vayu himself came there at the instance of Brahma.
4. Vayu the disciple of Brahma, the self-controlled lord who perceives everything directly; in whose bidding stay the fortynine Maruts always; who sustains the bodies of all living beings urging them perpetually by his own functionaries Prana and others; who is endowed with the eightfold glories; who supports the worlds with his holy hands; who is born of Aka$a; who possesses the two qualities of touch and sound and whom the philosophers call the material cause of fiery principle.
5. On seeing him at the hermitage the sages who were busy in a long Satra remembered the words of Brahma and felt unequalled pleasure.

187. According to the Vedic concept they are sons of Rudra but a legend represents their origin in an unborn son of Diti whom Indra dashed in the womb into fortynine pieces and gave the name Maruts.

Vdyavxyasarhhiti 178 ?

1. Standing up they welcomed and bowed to him. They offered him a golden seat.
2. He seated himself there and was worshipped by the sages. Congratulating them he enquired after their health. Vayu said: O brahmins, hope you are all quite well, now that this great sacrifice has concluded. Hope that the Asuras, the enemies of the gods, the destroyers of sacrifices do not harass you.
3. Hope that imprecations and expiatory rites do not take place. Hope that the rites are duly performed by you after worshipping the gods, with Stotra and Sastra hymns and the ancestors with the rites due to them. What do you propose to do afterwards, now that the great Satra has been concluded?
4. When addressed thus by Vayu, the meditator on Siva, the sages were delighted in their minds. They considered themselves sanctified. They replied thus humbly.
5. Today we have attained bliss; our penances are rendered fruitful since you have come for the increase of our welfare.
6. Listen to an old anecdote. Formerly we meditated on Prajapati when we were overwhelmed by darkness. We wanted to acquire perfect knowledge.
7. The lord Brahma worthy of being sought refuge in, blessed us as we sought refuge in him and said, “O brahmins, Lord Rudra is superior to all. He is the ultimate cause.
8. Only the devotee sees the lord whose real nature cannot be reflected upon or argued over. Devotion is acquired through grace and through grace is bliss attained.
9. Hence, in order to propitiate him perform the Satra. Worship him who is the ultimate cause, perform Satra in Naimisa extending over a long period.
10. At the end of the Satra, by means of his grace Vayu will come there. You will acquire perfect knowledge from his mouth and attain welfare.
11. Commanding thus Brahma sent us all to this place. O fortunate one, we were eagerly awaiting your arrival.

22. Wc sat and performed the Satra for a thousand divine years. We had nothing to wish for except your advent.

23. On hearing thus this story of the sages who had performed the satra for a long time Vayu was delighted in his mind and stayed there surrounded by the sages.

24. On being implored by the sages, the lord succinctly narrated the glory of Siva beginning with creation in order to enhance their piety.

# CHAPTER FIVE

# ( The Principles of $iva cult )

Suta said:-

1. There at the outset the fortunate residents of the Naim isa bowed duly to lord Vayu and asked him. The sages said : —

2. How did you, sir, acquire the knowledge of Siva? Wherefore is your devotion to Siva, the Brahman whose birth is unmanifest.

Vayu said :

3. The twenty-first kalpa shall be known as Svetalohita. In that kalpa the four-faced lord, desirous of creative activity performed a penance.

4-5. Delighted by his austere penance his father lord Siva, foremost among the handsome assumed the divine form of a bachelor. He became a sage Sveta and uttering divine words appeared in front of him.

6. On seeing his father, Brahma bowed to him and secured perfect knowledge along with Gayatri.

7. Having acquired knowledge, the four-faced lord created all living beings — the mobile and immobile.

8. That immortal knowledge was acquired by

through the power of penance from that face through which it was acquired by Brahma.

The sages said: —

# 9.

What is that knowledge attained by you— the knowledge that is auspicious, more truthful than the most truthful, abiding by which a man attains happiness.

# Vayu said :

# 10.

Great and steady devotion shall be applied by a man who wishes for happiness, for the perfect knowledge of the individual soul, illusion and the lord who releases from the bondage.

# 11-12.

Misery arises from ignorance. It is removed by knowledge that is a correct and precise comprehension of objects. Object is twofold: sentient and non-sentient. There is a controller of the two. The three are called Pasu, PaSa and Pati.

# 13.

On many occasions knowers of reality call the three by Aksara, Ksara and Ksaraksarapaia.

# 14.

The Pasu is called Aksara. The Pa 'a is called Ksara. Pati is called Ksaraksarapara.

The sages said: —

# 15.

O Maruta, please mention What is Ksara? What is Aksara? What is that which is greater and beyond these two?

# Vayu said :

# 16.

Prakrti is Ksara. Purusa is Aksara. The one who urges these two is the greatest Paramcsvaia.

The sages said :

# 17.

What is this Prakrti? is Purusa? is the relationship between the two? Who is this instigator ISvara?

# Vayu said :

# 18.

Maya is the Prakrti. Purusa is enveloped by Maya. The relationship is through the root and Karrnan. Lord Siva is the instigator.

# Sivapurdna

The sages said:

# 19.

What is this Maya that is mentioned? Of what form is he who is enveloped by Maya? Of what nature is the root? Whence is it? What is Sivahood? Whence is Siva?

# 20.

Vdyu said: Maya is the Sakti of Mahesvara. The form of Cit is enveloped by Maya. The dirt is that which covers the Cit. Sivatva is his own innate purity.

# 21.

The sages said: How does the Maya cover up the pervading one? What for? Why is this covering up of the Purusa? By what is it made to recede?

# 22.

Vdyu said: Even a pervasive can be covered just as Kala etc. that are pervasive. The cause is Karrnan alone. The purpose is enjoyment. It recedes when dirt is quelled.

# 23-24.

The sages said: What are these Kala etc.? What is Karrnan? What its beginning and what its end? What the fruit? What the support? Whose enjoyment? What is enjoyed? What is the means of enjoyment, the cause of the diminution of dirt? Of what nature is the Purusa devoid of dirt?

# 25-28.

Vdyu said: Kala, Vidya, Ruga, Kfila and Niyati, these are certain entities. The enjoyer is Purusa, Kaiman is merit and sin. The fruits are happiness and misery. The beginningless dirt till the enjoyment rests in the ignorant soul. Enjoyment is for quelling Kannan. The unmanifest is what is enjoyed. The means of enjoyment is the body with external and the internal senses as doors. Dirt is quelled by grace acquired by piety. When the dirt is quelled the Purusa becomes equal to Siva.

# 29.

The sages said: What are the several functions of the five principles Kala etc.? Why is Atman called the enjoyer and Purusa?

# 30.

Of what nature is that unmanifest?



---

Vdyaviyasaihhitd
form is it enjoyed? What is its instrument in the act of enjoyment? What is it called body?

Vdyu said:

# 31.

Vidyii (learning) that reveals the place and activity, time and passion these are the inducing agents. Time is the conditioning factor there; destiny is the controlling factor.

# 32.

The unmanifest is the cause. It consists of three Gunas. It is the source of origin and the place of merger. It is called Pradhana and Prakrti by philosophers.

# 33.

Characteristically unmanifest it becomes manifest through Kalas. It is of the form and content of happiness, misery and delusion while being enjoyed. It has the three Gunas.

# 34.

The Gunas Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, originate from Prakrti. Like oil in the gingelly seed they are present in the latest form in Prakrti.

# 35-36.

Happiness and its cause constitute briefly the Sattvaic trait. The Rajasaic trait is its opposite. Stunned state and delusion are Tamasic traits. The Sattvaic movement is upward progress; the Tamasic one is downfall; the middle course is cited as Rajasaic.

# 37-36.

Briefly the unmanifest with its ramifications is as follows: - five subtle and primary elements, five gross elements, five sense-organs of activity and the set of four, viz. Pradhana, intellect, ego and mind.

# 39.

When it is in the state of a cause, it is unmanifest; when it is in the state of an effect such as the body, pot etc, it is manifest.

# 40.

Just as the pot is not materially different from clay, so the manifest, body etc. is not materially different from the unmanifest.

# 41.

Hence the unmanifest alone is the cause of the composite viz. organs, body but their support, the object of enjoyment is unmanifest.

The sages said:

# 42.

How can Atman which is separate from the sense-organs and the body exist?



---


Vdyu said:

# 43.

The separateness of all-pervading lord from the intellect, sense-organs and the body is definite. There is something called Atman. A reason thereof is difficult to understand.

# 44.

The intellect, the sense-organs and the bodies are not the Atman due to indefinite knowledge and non-eternality.

# 45.

Hence the one who has the cognition of experienced objects and comprehends the entire knowables, is sung about in the Vedas and Upanisads as the immanent soul.

# 46.

It is eternal. It incorporates and pervades everything. It stands everywhere. Still it is not perceived by any one clearly anywhere.

# 47.

This Atman cannot be perceived by the eye nor by any other sense-organ. The great Atman is comprehended only by the enlightened mind.

# 48.

It is neither woman nor man nor an eunuch. It is neither above nor below nor in the sides. It is nowhere.

# 49.

It remains unembodied in the unsteady bodies. It is stable and steady like a stump. It is unchanging. Only the sober, self-possessed and bold can perceive it by means of reflection.

# 50.

Of what avail is much talk? The Purusa is separate from the body. Unwarranted is the vision of those who do not see it separate.

# 51.

There is nothing more impure, uncontrolled, miserable and uncertain than the body of the Purusa.

# 52.

The Purusa becomes happy, miserable or deluded on becoming associated with the body—the seed of all adversities caused by his own activities.

# 53.

As the field flooded with water generates sprouts so also the action flooded with ignorance generates the man.

# 54.

Thousands in number are his bodies both of the past and the future. These are mortals, abodes of excessive distress.

# 55.

A perpetual stay in the bodies that successively



---


Vdyavxyasarhhitd 1793

come to the embodied soul and get shattered, is never attained by any one.

# 56.

Covered by and separated from these bodies this soul resembles the disc of the moon in the sky that is covered by and separated from the passing clouds.

# 57.

The different activities of the soul in the different bodies resemble the motion of the die in the different squares in the chess-board.

# 58.

None belongs to him. He does not belong to anyone. The contact with wives, sons and kinsmen is but a chance meeting on the way.

# 59.

The mutual contact of living beings is like that of a piece of log with another log in the great ocean. The two meet together and get separated.

# 60.

He sees the body but the body does not see him. A certain other being, the great Atman sees both but both of them do not see him.

# 61.

All living beings beginning with Biahmfi and ending with the immobile are termed Pasus. Examples cited relate to these Pasus.

# 62.

These Pasus are bound with Pa

# 63.

The ignorant creature cannot effect and prevent his happiness and misery. Induced by the lord he goes up to the heaven or falls into the deep ditch.

# CHAPTER SIX

# ( The Principle of Siva cult )

The sages said: —

Now 1. You have explained what is Pasu and what is Pasa. mention what is their lord different in characteristics from the two?

Vayu said:

2. There is a certain releaser of Pasu from Pasa. He is Pali, the creator of the universe. He is the abode of endless charming attributes.

3. In his absence how could the universe have been created, since Pasa is insentient and the Pasu is ignorant?

4. Without an intelligent cause nothing has ever been seen anywhere created by Pradhana, Paramfmu or any such insentient being.

5. Since the universe is an effect possessing parts it is dependent on a creator. And creativity can be only in Pati and not in Pasu or Pasa.

6. Creativity of Pasu without the knowledge of creation like the going of a blind man is due to the inducement of his lord.

7. Realising distinction between him and himself and being gratified after resorting to him Pasu can attain immortality.

8. The sphere of Pati is really greater than and beyond that of Pasu and Pasa. The knower of Brahman becomes free from births by knowing him alone.

9. Lord the redeemer of the universe sustains the universe of Ksara and Aksara, the two in unison, the manifest and the unmanifest.

10. The enjoyer, the enjoyed and the instigator the three alone shall be distinguished. There is nothing else to be known by the seekers of knowledge.

1. He is the lord born alone. Associated with ISanis, his Saktis he creates the worlds and rules over them.
2. He is always alone. There is none second to him.
3. After creating the worlds he protects them and withdraws them.
4. He has eyes, faces and feet all round.
5. The sole lord and creator of the heaven and earth is MaheSvara. He is the origin and the place of merger of all the gods.
6. The Sruti says that Rudra the great sage is superior to all; he creates Hiranyagarbha the first among the deities.
7. I know this great Puru?a, the undying, steady, having the colour of the sun, the lord stationed beyond darkness.
8. There is nothing greater, subtler and grosser than this. The universe is filled by him.
9. He has all faces, heads and necks. He lies in the cavity of the heart of all. He is all-pervading and present everywhere.
10. He has hands, feet, eyes, heads, ears and faces all around. He stands enveloping everything in the world.
11. He has all apparent attributes but is devoid of the sense-organs. The lord is the friend and refuge of all.
12. They call him the great Purusa—who sees without eyes, hears without ears and comprehends all and whom no one knows.
13. He is subtler than the atom, greater than the greatest. He is the unchanging. He lies in the cavity of the heart of this Pasu.

25. By the grace of the creator, one devoid of sorrows perceives him who is endowed with the excellence of greatness and who does not possess intelligence but is intelligence itself.

26. I know the unaging ancient omnipresent lord whose birth is denied by those who can expound the knowledge of the Brahman.196

27. After annihilating in the end, the lord creates the universe again from the beginning in association with his manifold Saktis.

28-29. The Maya of Siva is the unborn mother of the universe and has variegated colours and shapes. It is white, red and black. She, the unborn, gives birth to man. He, the unborn, resorts to it and gets involved in distress. Another Aja, the liberated soul, eschews her after she has been enjoyed.196

30. Two birds resort to the same tree. One eats the sweet fruit, the other simply watches without eating.197

31-32. Sitting on this tree the deluded Purusa bewails. When he sees the lord, the ultimate cause, and realises his greatness he is freed from sorrow and becomes happy.

33. The great Atman, the Mayin entering this, creates the universe by his Maya. Maya shall be known as Prakrti and Mahesvara as Mayin.

34-35. The universe is permeated by his parts. The Purusa attains perpetual peace and calmness on realising lord Siva the creator and enveloper of the universe and the subtler of the subtlest, from his very inception in the foetus.

36. He alone is Kala, the protector, the lord of universe. On realising him one is released from the noose of death.

37. On realising the lord pervading all living beings like the subtle cream over the ghee, one is freed from sins.

# 40.

None can grasp his top, sides or middle. There is nothing resembling him. His is the great fame. 198

# 41.

Those who are frightened of rebirths meditate on the unborn. For the sake of succour they resort to the front face of Rudra.

# 42.

The two Vidya and Avidya lie hidden in the imperishable, infinite great Brahman.

# 43.

Avidya is perishable while Vidya is imperishable. He who rules over the two is lord Siva. He is other than the two.

# 44.

It is he who spreads his net in various ways, creates all and rules all. He possesses such exploits.

# 45.

He illuminates the quarters above, below and to the sides, shining himself. He is innately alone, foremost of all who presides over all.

# 46.

Transforming the attributes, the expressions of nature and expressed ones into what is enjoyed and the one that enjoys, he occupies the universe.

# 47.

The gods and the sages know him as hidden in the secret Upanisad, who is Brahman, greater than the greatest, the progenitor of Brahma and the cause of the universe.

# 48.

Those who knew the lord eschewed their bodies. The lord can be realised only through piety. He is wishless, the cause of positive and negative substances and the creator of Kalas.

# 49.

It is the greatness of the lord whereby this universe revolves but the deluded people call it a natural occurrence or the power of time.

# 50.

It is by him in the form of the annihilator of death that these are enveloped perpetually, the activities urged by him transform into worldly existence along with the elements.

# 51-53.

The individual indulges in activities more and more and returns to the earth. He gets entangled in the tattvas. By means of the fourteen attributes of the Atman he pursues worldly activities. When these activities cease even the results are quelled.

# 54.

When these are quelled he goes to another world. This is the cause of union of the two— the enjoyer and the enjoyed.

# 55.

Lord alone is beyond the three times. He is attributeless, the knower of all, the lord of the three attributes. He is brahman itself greater than the greatest.

# 56.

We worship and meditate upon the lord of manifold forms, the unborn, lord of people, object of worship and meditation by the entire universe. He is stationed in our minds.

# 57.

He is beyond Kala. From him the whole cosmos originates. He is the repository of the universe and effects virtue and quells sins. He is the lord of enjoyment.

# 58.

We know him as the greatest of lords, the greatest of deities, the lord of the worlds.

# 59.

He has neither cause nor effect. Nowhere in the universe there is anyone equal or superior to him.

# 60.

It is mentioned in the Vedas that his threefold power is great, manifold and innate, comprising knowledge, strength and activity. It is by these activities that the universe is created.

# 61.

He has no lord, no sex and no ruler. He is the cause of causes and the lord of lords.

# 62.

He has no progenitor nor does he take birth from anywhere. He has no causes of birth such as Dirt, Maya etc.

# 63.

He is the solitary lord hidden in all living beings. Spread all round he is the innate soul of all living beings. He is mentioned as the presiding deity of all sacred rites.

# 64.

He is the abode of all living beings, the cosmic witness, the provoker of thoughts, devoid of attributes and the sole lord with self-control, devoid of activities and helpless.

# 65.

He is the most permanent among the permanent. He is the most sentient among the sentient.

# 66.

On realising the lord of the universe, comprehensible through Sankhya and Yoga, the cause of the universe the person gets released from all illusions.

# 67.

He is the creator and the knower of the universe. He is the knower of his source, and the creator of time.

Vdyavlyasarhhitd 1 799 possesses attributes. He is the lord of Prakrti and the individual soul; he presides over the Gunas; he is the releaser of illusion.

68-69. After realising the lord who at the outset created Brahma and taught him the Vedas, through the clarity of my intellect, I shall be desirous of salvation from this worldly existence. I take refuge in Siva who is devoid of attributes and activities, who is quiescent, the undespicable and the unsullied.

70-71. After realising the great bridge that takes to immortality I shall be quiescent like the fire that has consumed fuel. When men wear the ether as they wear a hide they will realise the end of miseries before they have realised Siva.

72-73. O sages, due to the power of penance, the grace of the lord and the result of my good fortune I secured the holy knowledge straight from the mouth of Brahma, the knowledge that quells sins, lies hidden in the Upanisads and was enunciated in a previous Kalpa.

74. This excellent knowledge shall not be delivered to one who is not quiet, nor to a son who is not well behaved nor to one who is not one’s own disciple.

75. These facts reveal to him who is of noble soul, who has great devotion to the lord and to the preceptor in the form of Siva.

76. Hence listen to the gist. Siva is greater than prakrti and Puru?a and beyond it. At the time of creation he creates the universe and at the time of dissolution he withdraws everything.

# CHAPTER SEVEN

# The glory of Time

The sages said: —

1. Everything originates from Kala and is annihilated through Kala. There is nothing independent of Kala anywhere.

2. The whole universe caught in its mouth whirls like a wheel through the activities of creation and annihilation.

3. By his control, Brahma, Vi$nu, Rudra, gods and Asuras cannot transgress the laws of propriety,

4. It classifies itself in the factors of past, present and future and makes people grow old. Thus freely lording over all it is extremely terrible.

5. O skilful one, please tell us. Who is this lord Kala? Under whose control is he? Who does not come under his control?

V&#x26;yu said:

6. It is the great splendour of lord Siva named Kalatman. Kala, Kastha, Nime?a are the forms it embodies.

7. It is the power of the lord that controls the universe in the form of directives which are untransgressable to the universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings.

8. The Energy in the form of Kala consists of its various parts. It comes out of it and permeates it like the piece of steel that sheds sparks of fire.

9. The universe is under the control of Kala. Kala is not under the control of the universe. Kala is under the control of Siva. Siva is not subject to its control.

10. Since the unobstructed splendour of Siva is firmly fixed in Kala the limit of Kala is extensive and is untransgressable.

11. Who can go beyond Kala with the help of intellect? None can go beyond Karman perpetrated by Kala.

12. Even those who attack the earth and rule it under a single umbrella cannot step beyond Kala like the oceans that do not overflow the shore.

13. Even those who restrain their sense-organs and conquer the universe cannot conquer Kala. Kala overwhelms them.

14. Physicians well-versed in medicines regularly taking in elixirs and aphrodisiacs do not thwart death. Indeed Kala is untransgressable.

15. The individual soul proposes something on the basis of its glory, beauty, conduct, strength and pedigree but K&#x26;la disposes it.



---


# 16.

By means of pleasing, displeasing and unexpected contacts, Kala unites and separates the living beings.

# 17.

At the same time when someone is miserable another is very happy. Wonderful indeed is the unscrutable nature of Kala.

# 18.

A young man changes into a feeble aged man. A powerful man becomes weak. A rich man becomes deprived of prosperity. O brahmins, the ways of Kala are wonderful.

# 19.

Neither nobility of birth, nor good conduct nor strength nor skill is of any avail. Kala is unthwartable.

# 20.

Kala is impartial in its activity over those who are well guarded donors attended upon by songs and musical instruments as well as those who are helpless, living on doles.

# 21.

Even elixirs, panaceas and well administered medicines do not have any effect if the time is not opportune. Those very things brought into use at the proper time are efficacious and yield happiness.

# 22.

No one dies or is born before time. No one flourishes well before the proper time. No one is happy or miserable before the time for it arrives. There is no object which is untimely.

# 23.

At the proper time the cool wind blows, the rain falls; the heat subsides and everything grows.

# 24.

Kala is the cause of all births. Plants grow and perish at the proper time. The living world too comes into life.

# 25.

He who thus correctly understands the principle of Kala goes beyond it and sees that which is beyond Kala.

# 26.

Obeisance to the great. Obeisance to Siva of wonderful form who has no Kala to influence him, no bondage and liberation and is identical neither with Purusa nor Prakrti nor the universe.

# CHAPTER EIGHT

# (The span of life of the trinity)

The sages said: —

1. By what unit is the duration of life calculated in K&#x26;la? What is the upper limit of Kala in the form of number?

Vdyu said —

The basic unit of life is Nime$a. The upper limit is Santyatita.
The time taken for the winking of an eye is Nime$a. Fifteen such Nime$as constitute one Ka?tha.
Thirty such Kasthas make one Kala. Thirty Kalas make one Muhurta. Thirty Muhurtas make one day.
Thirty days constitute one month of two fortnights. A month constituting the bright and dark halves is one day of the manes.
Six Masas constitute one Ayana. Two Ayanas make a year. One human year constitutes one day and night for the celestials, Uttarayana being the day and Daksinayana the night.
The divine month like the human month constitutes thirty days. The year of the gods constitutes twelve months.
Three hundred and sixty human years make one divine year.
The calculation of yugas is based on the divine unit of time. The wise understand that there are four Yugas in the land of Bharata.
The first Yuga is Kfta, then comes Treta. Dvapara and Kali are the other Yugas. These are the four Yugas.
Four thousand years constitute the Krtayuga. The period of four hundred years constitutes the intervening junction and a hundred year period constitutes Sandhyamsa (a subdivision of the junction).
In the three other yugas, their Sandhyas and

V&#x26;yaviyasarhhit&#x26; 1803
Saifdhyam as the thousands and the hundreds become reduced by one.

# 15.

Thus, the twelve thousand years and the surplus period constitute a Gaturyuga. A thousand Caturyugas constitute a Kalpa.

# 16.

Seventy-one Caturyugas constitute a Manvantara. In a Kalpa there are fourteen such Manvantaras.

# 17.

In this order, hundreds and thousands of such Kalpas and Manvantaras have passed by this time.

# 18.

They are innumerable and hard to be known precisely. It is impossible to mention them in detail in the precise order.

# 19.

A Kalpa constitutes a day of Brahma of unmanifest origin. A thousand Kalpas make a year of Brahma.

# 20.

Eight thousand Brahma years make one Brahma Yuga. A thousand Brahma Yugas make one Savana of Brahma.

# 21.

Three thousand and three Savanas make the lifetime of Brahma.

# 22-23.

A day of Brahma’s life constitutes the life of fourteen Indras, a month of his life constitutes four hundred and twenty Indras; a year of his life five thousand and forty Indras; his whole life five hundred and forty thousand Indras.

# 24-25.

A day of Vi$nu is the lifetime of Brahma. A day of Rudra is equal to the lifetime of Vi$nu. A day of Siva is equal to the life-period of one Rudra. A day of Sadasiva is the life-period of Siva. A day of Saksat Siva is the life-period of Sadasiva. The lifetime of the latter is equal to the life-period of five hundred and forty thousand previous deities.

# 26.

This Kala functions as directed by Sak$atsiva. Brahmins, this is the period of time of creation as mentioned by me.

# 27.

This Kalantara shall be known as a day of Paramesvara. ParameSvara’s night shall be known to extend so long.

His day is the period of creation. His night is

the period of dissolution. But understand that he has neither day nor night as we conceive them.

29-31. The dissolution is effected for the benefit of the world. The subjects, the Prajapatis, the three deities, gods, Asuras, the sense-organs, the sensual objects, the five great elements, the subtle and gross elements, the cosmic Intellect, the deities, all these abide during the day of the self-possessed Paramesvara. They get dissolved at the end of the day. At the end of the night again begins the origin of the universe.

32. Obeisance to the great Siva, the soul of the universe, whose energy in respect of activity, time and innate nature is untransgressable and under whose command the whole universe functions.

# CHAPTER NINE

# (The creation and sustenance)

The sages said:

1. How does lord Siva perform his great sport commanding all, creating the universe and placing it in position?

2. What is it that came into being at the outset? By what are all these pervaded? By which being of huge belly is this swallowed?

Vdyu said:

3. Sakti came into being at the outset; with SantyatHapada following. From Siva in association with Sakti Maya came into being and then the unmanifest from it.

4. Santyatitapada originated from Sakti and from it S|mtipada; then the Vidyapada; from it the Pratisthapada came into being.

5. Nivyttipada originated from Pratisthapada. Thus has been briefly described the creation induced by the lord.

6. The creation of these is in the inverse order; the anni-



---

V&#x26;yaviyasarhhitd 1805

Hilation is in the reverse order. There is a creator apart from and greater than what is indicated by these five Padas.

7. Hence the entire universe is pervaded by the five Kalas. Avyakta is the cause there but activitised by the Atman.

8-10. It is agreed that everything begins with intellect and ends with Visesa but the makership is neither of the Avyakta nor of the Purusa since Prakrti is insentient and Purusa ignorant. Without an intelligent cause nothing is created by the insentient beings— Pradhana, Paramanu etc. But the universe is dependent on a maker since it is an effect composed of parts.

11-12. Hence the creator must be powerful, independent, omnipotent and omniscient with no beginning, no end and endowed with lordly qualities. He is the maker of the universe, Mahadeva, Mahesvara, the protector and annihilator of everything. He is separate from it.

13. The transformation of Pradhana and the activities of the Purusa function at the bidding of the lord of truthful vow.

14. It is in the minds of the noble that this firm and permanent conviction finds a place. A being of meagre consciousness does not resort to this side.

15-17. Hundred Brahma years constitute the span of Brahma born of unmanifest. It is termed Para. Its half is Pai cirdha. At the advent of Dissolution the Avyakta withdraws to itself all its effects and abides in Atman.

18. When the Avyakta abides in Atman, when the effects have been withdrawn, Pradhana and Purusa stand on an equal footing.

19. The two have the Gunas of Tamas and Sattva, remaining on a par with each other. The two without the Gunas being predominant are mutually interwoven.

20. In the equal and undivided state of Gunas in the rise of darkness, when the wind was in lull and the water was calm, there was nothing to be seen.

21-22. When the universe was unmanifest the lord meditated upon the great Sakti throughout the night. When it dawned the lord in contact with Maya entered Pradhana and Purusa and set them to motion.

23.  Then at the bidding of Brahma, the creation evolved out of the unmanifest that is the source of origin and the spot of merger for all living creatures.

24.  Obeisance to him who is different from the worlds, in a fraction of whose Sakti everything terminates, whose will is ever variegated and wonderful far above that of the universe and whom those who know the path call the lord of the path — the Atman.

# CHAPTER TEN

# ( The description of creation)

Vayu said:

1. At the outset, at the bidding of I^vara the secondary elements beginning with the cosmic intellect and ending with Vise$a came into being from the Avyakta presided over by Purusa.
2. Then from these, the three deities Rudra, Visnu and Brahma were born as the cause of all.
3. Mahesvara bestows on these the power to pervade all the worlds unobstructed anywhere, unequalled perfect wisdom, the perpetual Siddhis of Anima etc; and the state of being the cause of activities of creation, sustenance and dissolution.
4. In another Kalpa he conferred on each the activities of creation, sustenance and dissolution in order that they may not have any mutual rivalry due to delusion of intellect.
5. These three are born from one another, sustain one another, flourish one another, respect and follow one another.
6. Somewhere Brahma, somewhere Visnu and somewhere Rudra are praised. However their glory does not diminish.
7. Only impetuous fools censure them. Undoubtedly they become demons and ghosts.
8. Lord Siva who is beyond the three Gunas, who is divided into four units, who is all-in-all and the support of all is the cause of creation.

# 10.

The Atman who has created the universe sportively remains as the lord of three deities as well as of Prakrti and Purusa.

# 11.

He alone is their support, he who is greater than all, who is supreme, eternal, devoid of attributes and is their Atman and their presiding deity.

# 12.

Hence he alone is Prakrti, Purusa, Sadasiva, Bhava, Vi$nu and Brahma. Everything is identical with Siva.

# 13.

In the beginning were born the cosmic intellect, the great principle. When it was agitated the ego was born. The ego was split into three.

# 14.

The ego split into the gross and subtle elements and the sense-organs. When the ego had the Sattva predominant the Sattvika creation took place.

# 15-16.

The secondary creation took place simultaneously. The five sense-organs, the five organs of activity and the eleventh the mind, originated. The mind is both an organ of knowledge and of activity. When the ego becomes associated with Tamas, the Bhutatanmatras are born.

# 17*

Since it is the cause of Bhutas it is called Bhutadi. From this is born the Sabdatanmatra, from this the ether.

# 18.

From the ether the Sparsatanmatra, from it Vayu, from Vayu the Rupatanmatra, from this the Tejas, from Tejas the Rasa tanmatra is born.

# 19.

From Rasa the water; from this the Gandha Tanmatra is born, from this the PrthivI, from these elements the mobile and immobile beings are created.

# 20.

Since they are presided over by Purusa and blessed by Avyakta the principles beginning with Mahat and ending with Visesa generate the cosmic egg.

# 21.

When thus the activities of Brahma are fulfilled Brahma becomes flourished in that Egg.

# 22.

He is the first embodied soul, called Purusa. He is the first creator of living beings. Brahma thus existed in the beginning.

# 23.

From him was born the intellect, the cause of

200. On the scheme of creation see P. 1078 note.

# Sivapurdna

virtue and prosperity, with the characteristics of wisdom and detachment.

24-25. Whatever is wished for by the mind is born of Avyakta. He functions in the three worlds, dividing himself into three because he has all in his control, possesses all the attributes and is dependent on Avyakta. In these three forms he creates, supports and annihilates.

26. He is four-faced as creator; as destroyer he is Kila and as Purusa he has thousand heads. The self-born has thus three states.

27. As Brahma he has Sattva and Rajas, as Kala Tamas and Rajas, as Visnu he has Sattva alone. Thus the increase of Gunas in the lord is threefold.

28. As Brahma he creates the worlds, as Kala he condenses; as Puru?a he sustains; he is indifferent. Thus the activity of the lord is threefold.

29. Since he is divided into three he is called Triguna. Since he has split himself into four he is glorified as Caturvyuha.

30. Since he is the beginning he is called Adideva; since he is unborn he is called Aja; since he protects the subjects he is called Prajapati.

31. The golden Meru is the foetus of that great Atman; the oceans constitute the water of the womb and the mountains constitute the outer skin of the womb.

32. All these worlds in this universe, the moon, sun, stars, planets and Vayu are in this cosmic egg.

33. The egg is enveloped with waters ten times bigger than it. The waters are enveloped by Tejas ten times bigger.

34. The Tejas is enveloped by Vayu ten times bigger. Vayu is enveloped by Akasa and Akasa is enveloped by Bhutadi.

35. The Bhutadi is enveloped by the Mahat. The Mahat is enveloped by Avyakta. Thus the egg is enveloped by even coverings.

36. O excellent brahmins, eight Prakrtis, the causes of creation, sustenance and destruction are stationed covering each of these.



---

Vdyaviyasartihitd
# 37.

Thus born of one another, the effects and their causes sustain one another supporting and being supported.

# 38.

Just as the tortoise spreads its limbs first and then withdraws them, so the Avyakta creates the beings and then withdraws them.

# 39.

Everything originating from Avyakta is born in this order. When the time of dissolution arrives it gets dissolved in the reverse order.

# 40.

The Gunas become equal and unequal due to Kala. Dissolution takes place when there is equilibrium of the Gunas. When this is upset, creation takes place.

# 41.

Thus this egg, large and thick, is the source of origin of Brahma. It is called Brahma’s sphere; Brahma is the lord of this.

# 42.

There are thousands and crores of such eggs stationed at the sides, above and below since Pradhana is present everywhere.

# 43.

In the different places there are four-faced Brahmas, Visnus and Rudras created by Pradhana with the presence of Siva.

# 44.

The lord is beyond the manifest. The egg is born of the unmanifest. From that egg is born lord Brahma and the worlds are created by him.

# 45.

The primary creation of Pradhana is without the intervention of the cosmic intellect. The ultimate dissolution is effected sportively by the lord alone at the end.

# 46.

What is called as the unmanifest cause is Pradhana. Brahma is the progeny of Prakrti. The Pradhana has neither beginning nor middle nor end. Its prowess is infinite. It is white and deep red. It is associated with Purusa.

# 47.

When the Rajas predominates it becomes generative. It creates the eight secondary tattvas in the beginning, which cause flourishing of the worlds. In the end it devours them.

# 48.

The stability and the subsequent operation of the causes projected by Prakrti take place by the thought of supreme lord whose prowess is not effected by Prakrti.

# CHAPTER ELEVEN

# (The description of creation)

The sages said: —

1. Please narrate the Manvantaras, the Kalpas, the subsidiary creations and the re-creation after dissolution.

Vayu said: —

The tenure of Brahma who comes and goes according to the calculation of time is first a Parardha and another Parardha thereafter. At the end of the latter the re-creation takes place.
In each day in the life of Brahma, the fourteen Manus come and go.
The Manvantaras and Kalpas have no beginning or end. Being unknowable they cannot be narrated separately.
Even if they be knowable, of what avail is it to you to know them. Hence I do not attempt to narrate them separately.
Among these Kalpas, I describe the creation and re-creation of this Kalpa.
The current Kalpa is named Varaha. Excellent brahmins, in this Kalpa the Manus are fourteen in number.
Among the Manus, Svayambhuva and others constitute the first seven Manus, Savarnika and others constitute the next seven. Among them Vaivasvata Manu is the seventh.
It shall be known that in all the Manvantaras, the creation, sustenance and annihilation are more or less of the same nature.
When the previous Kalpa had ceased, the storm had burst, the forest and trees had been uprooted, the fire-god had consumed the worlds like dry grass, the earth had been drenched, oceans had overflowed their shores, the quarters had been sunk in deep sheet of water and the waters of dissolution had started their fierce devil dances with the waves for their arms showing movements of gestures by means of the water, Brahma assumed the form of Visnu, slept soundly in that vast expanse of water.

# Vdyavfyasarfihita

# 1811

# 14.

One shall cite this mantra, a Sloka, regarding Narayana. O excellent sages, listen to the mantra as well as the actual meaning of the words.

# 15.

Waters are called ‘Narati’. Waters are sons of Nara. He is called Narayana because waters constitute his abode.

# 16-17.

With their palms joined in reverence the Siddha residents of Janaloka and the gods awakened the lord of gods who was in Yogic slumber, with hymns, in the morning as the Srutis had done formerly at the beginning of creation.

# 18.

The lord woke up, got up from his bed and came to the water. He looked all round at the quarters with the Yogic slumber still lingering in the eyes idly.

# 19.

He did not see anything except himself. He sat up like a wonderstruck person and began to ponder deeply.

# 20.

“Where is that charming goddess the great Earth, with her lofty mountains, rivers, cities and forests?”

# 21.

Thinking thus Brahma could not locate the earth. Then he thought of his father, the three-eyed lord.

# 22.

By meditating on the lord of gods, of immeasurable splendour, Brahma understood that the earth had sunk under water.

# 23.

Then Brahma desirous of lifting up the Earth, thought of the divine Boar supporting about and diving into the waters.

# 24-29.

He then assumed the form of a Boar and entered the nether worlds in order to lift up the Earth. His body was like a huge mountain. His snorting sound was like thunder. He had the lustre of a blue cloud. He was terrible with his snorting sound. His shoulders were thick, heavy and rounded. His buttocks were plump and raised. The tips of his calves were short and rounded. The hoots were sharp. His eyes were round and terrible having the brilliance of rubies. The huge body was oval-shaped. The stiff ears shone brilliantly. Inhaling and exhaling his breath he stirred up the waters of dissolution. The shining manes covered his beautiful cheeks and shoulders. He was embellished in gemset.

30. Then the boar that resembled a mountain shone well as if he had reached the foot of the lord.

31. Then he lifted the Earth sunk under water and held it on his curved fangs. He rose up from the nether worlds.

32. On seeing him, the Siddhas, sages and other human beings rejoiced and danced. They scattered flowers on his head.

33. The body of the Boar covered up with flowers shone like the mountain of collyrium with glow-worms falling on it.

34. The Boar brought the earth to its own place. It then assumed his natural form and fixed it there.

35. He levelled the earth, fixed the mountains and set up the four worlds on the earth as before.

36. Thus after lifting the earth along with the mountains from the midst of the vast sea of dissolution the lord created the universe—the mobile and immobile beings.

# CHAPTER TWELVE

# ( The description of creation)

Vdyu said :

1. At the time of meditation while he was pondering intelligently, delusion in the form of darkness appeared before him.

2. Darkness, delusion, great delusion, blinding darkness and ignorance; the five appeared before the noble lord.

3. While he was meditating, the creation was ramified into five, enveloped all round by darkness as in a seed vessel (?)

4. Both within and without it was devoid of light benumed and unconscious. It had no intellect, faces and sense-organs.

5-6o Hence this creation became stationary consisting of trees and mountains. On seeing that this creation did not

Brahma was dissatisfied. He began conceiving and meditating a second time. While he meditated, the lower animals came into being.

1. These animals had light within but not without. They had the form of animals and went a wrong path.
2. When this creation too proved ineffective the creation of the gods of the Sattvika type took place.
3. Men had plenty of pleasure, were not concealed but had light within and light without. They had innate consciousness too.
4. Again he meditated and from the unmanifest evolved the human creation which had a downward trend. Though effective it was full of misery.
5. The human beings had light within and light without. They had Tamas and Rajas in abundance. The fifth creation appeared in four forms in respect of Viparyaya, Sakti, Tusti and Siddhi. These had no possessions, being of different species, prone to eating and drinking, were known as Bhutas etc.
6. The first creation of Brahma is that of Mahat; the second is that of subtle elements and is called Bhutasarga; the third is known as organic.
7. The primary creation took place without the intervention of intellect. The fourth was the creation of immobile beings.
8. The fifth was the creation of animal kingdom; the sixth of gods; the seventh of human beings. The eighth is called Anugraha and the ninth Kumara.
9. The first three creations are primary. They work without intelligence. The five secondary creations function intelligently.
10. Brahma had in the beginning created four sons: Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana and Sanatkumara. These are known as yogins free from passion and jealousy.
11. They were not interested in the activity of creation because their minds were drawn towards the lord. When Sanaka and others disinterested in creation had left the world,

# Sivapttrdna

Brahm£, desirous of creation, performed penance. Though he performed penance nothing happened.

23. When a long time elapsed he was distressed and his distress turned into anger. From the eyes of the infuriated Brahma drops of tears fell.

24. From these goblins and ghosts emerged. On seeing these born of tears Brahma censured himself.

25. As a result of anger and annoyance he fell into swoon. Then the enraged Brahma cast off his breath.

26. Then Rudra, the lord of vital breaths, appeared through the mouth of Brahma in order to confer unequalled favour.

27. Lord Rudra divided himself into eleven Atmans. When these appeared they were addressed by him.

28-29. O dear, you have been created by me for blessing the worlds. Hence endeavour assiduously for the establishment and benefit of the world and for its progeny. Thus spoken to, they cried and ran all round.

30. In view of their crying and flight they are called Rudras. Rudras are vital breaths and vital breaths are Rudras.

31. Then Rudra, the merciful son of Brahma, bestowed vital breaths on Brahma.

32. Rudra was delighted at the return of Brahma to life. He spoke to Brahma.

33. O Brahma, preceptor of the worlds, do not be afraid. Your vital breaths have been resuscitated by me. O one of good rites, get up comfortably.

34-35. On hearing these words as if heard in dreams Brahma glanced at Rudra, his eyes shedding lustre of lotuses, when the vital breath returned to him. With palms joined in reverence he spoke in pleasing but majestic tone.

36. “Indeed by your very vision you delight my mind.

37. Who are you, sir, standing in cosmic form dividing yourself into eleven forms?”

On hearing his words, Siva lord of the gods touched Brahma with his pleasing hands and spoke.



---



VdyavtyasarhhitS 1815

38. Know me as the great Atman, born as your son. The eleven Rudras have come to protect you well.

39. Hence shake off this lethargy through my blessing. Be wakeful. It behoves you to create beings as before.

40. When the lord spoke thus, Brahma was pleased. He eulogised Rudra with the eight names.

Brahma said:

41-43. (i) Obeisance O lord Rudra, with the splendour of the sun; to lord Bhava the taste, of the form of water; to Sarva of the form of the earth, Nandin the bull; to Isa, Vasu in the form of touch, to the lord of Pasus, to the fire-god of great brilliance, to Bhima in the form of ether, the sound, the subtle element, to Ugra of terrible features in the form of the sacrificer, to Mahadcva with Uma and the moon. Obeisance to the lord of eight forms.

44. After eulogising Mahadcva, Brahma, the grandfather of the worlds requested the lord after due homage.

45. O lord of the past and the future, O Rudra, my son, it was for the creation that you the destroyer of the cupid were born out of my limbs.

46. Hence, O lord of the universe, help me in this task. It behoves you to create beings everywhere.

47. Thus requested by him Rudra, the suppressor of the Tripuras, consented to his proposal.

48. Then Brahma congratulated him. Permitted by him Brahma created people.

49. He mentally created Marici, Bhjrgu, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Dak$a, Atri and Vasi$tha. He created Dharma and Samkalpa too.

50. These are the twelve sons of Brahma including Rudra. They are the ancient householders.

51. Their families are twelve including the gods. Endowed with progeny and holy rites they are embellished by the sages.

52-53. Then he created the four- the gods, Asuras, Pitjrs and the human beings. Desirous of creating these,



---


# 1816

# Sivafmrdna

Brahma set himself to the task of creation along with Rudra. He created the gods from his face and the pitj*s from the sides.

54. From his loins he created the Asuras; from the organ of generation the human beings. The Rak?asas overwhelmed by hunger were born of his privities.

55. Strong night-prowlers with Tamas and Rajas prominent were born as his sons. The serpents, Yak$as, Bhutas and Gandharvas were born.

56. The crows were created from the sides, birds from his chest, goats from the face and serpents from the sides.

57. From his feet were born the horses, elephants, Sarabhas, wild oxen, deer, camels, mules, stags and other animals.

58-62. Medicinal herbs, fruits and roots were born of his hairs. From his eastern face he created Gayatri, Rks, Trivjrtsama, Rathantara, Agni stoma and other sacrifices. From his southern face he created Yajus, Traistubha Chandas, the fifteen Stomas, Brhatsama and Uktha. From his western face he created Saman, Jagati Chandas, the seventeen Stomas, Vairupya and Atiratra mantras. From his northern face he created the Atharva Veda, the twenty-one Aptorva-man, Anustubh Chandas and the Vairaja. High and low animals and living beings were born of his different limbs.

63. Yaksas, Pisacas, Gandharvas, Apsaras, human beings, Kinnaras, Raksasas, birds, deer and other animals, serpents etc. were born.

64. The mobile and immobile beings which were perishable and imperishable attained their activities.

65. Created again and again the beings retain their previous nature, violent or non-violent, soft or ruthless, virtuous or evil, true or false.

66-70. They attain birth with the impressions of their previous traits. The creator himself has assigned the variety and diversity to the elements, the sensual objects etc. He himself has assigned them names and forms through the Vedic texts. He has bestowed the names of the sages and the

Vdyaviyasarhhitd 1817

functions prescribed in the Vedas on those who were born at the close of the night. When a new season arrives its nature appears itself. So also when the new yuga arrives its nature appears along with it. Thus creation manifests itself through the limbs of Brahma.

71-73. Beginning with intellect and ending with Vi£e$a this secondary creation is derived from Prakrti itself. There in the Brahmavana which has the light of the moon and the sun, which is embellished by planets, stars, rivers, oceans, mountains and abounds in beautiful cities and countries the unmanifest Brahma, having his source in the seed of Avyakta and blessed with the benign favour of the lord, the knower of all, moves about.

74-75. The eternal tree in the form of Brahma shall be resorted to by all. The cosmic intellect is its main stem as well as its branch; the sense-organs its inner hollows; the great elements characterize its size; the Visesa is its tender sprout; Dharma and Adharma its good flowers; happiness and misery its fruits.

76. Wise men say that the heaven is his head; the sky his navel; the sun and the moon his eyes; the quarters his ears and the earth his feet. That unponderable soul is the maker of all living beings.

77. Brahmins are born of his mouth: the Ksatriyas of his chest, the Vaisyas of his thighs; the Sudras of his feet. All the castes are born of his body.

# CHAPTER THIRTEEN

# ( The creation of Brahma and Vifnu )

The sages said: —

1. Sir, you have narrated the creation of the great Atman through the mouth of the four-faced lord. There we have a doubt.



---


# 2-6. The Odd-eyed Siva

is the foremost among the gods. The trident-bearing Siva is brilliant. Lord Rudra the Kalatman is Kapardin and Nilalohita. When the end of the yuga arrives he becomes infuriated and annihilates this universe including Brahma, Vi$riu and the fire-god. He makes the worlds shrink. Brahma and Vi?nu are under his control. They make obeisance to him out of fright. He is the lord who formerly created Brahma and Vi?nu from his limbs. He alone is the cause of acquisition and retention. He is the primordial and ancient god. How did such a lord become the son of Brahma who is born of Avyakta?

# 7.

We have also heard that Brahma and Vi?nu were born of Rudra and created Rudra. Thus they mutually created each other.

# 8.

How could the two, progenitors of the living beings, come out of each other thereby possessing both prominence or otherwise?

# 9.

There is nothing unseen or unheard by you. Everything is remembered by you who had been the disciple of the lord himself.

# 10.

Please narrate how Brahma became the lord of all sages. O dear, we are faithful and eager to hear the great glory of the lord.

# Vdyu said:

# 11.

O Brahmins, this question has been well put by you, experts in the art of queries. I had put the same query to Brahma who replied suitably. bom how

# 12.

I shall narrate how Rudra was and Brahma and Visnu were born from each other.

# 13-15.

The three are the Atmans as causes born of Mahcsvara; they are the causes of creation, sustenance and annihilation of the universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings. Endowed with great qualities they are sanctified by the great lord. Presided over by his Sakti they can always perform their activities. Brahma can create; Vi§nu can protect; Rudra can annihilate.

# 16-21.

But they rivalled with one another. Desirous of excelling one another they propitiated their father, the



---

Vdyaviyasarhhitd
supreme lord by means of penance. Attaining all round favour of the lord at the outset in a former Kalpa, Rudra created Brahma and Vi$nu. In another Kalpa, Brahma created Rudra and Vi$nu. In another Kalpa Vi$nu created Rudra and Brahma. Thus in different Kalpas, Brahma, Vi$nu and Rudra desiring mutual benefit are born of one another. Based on the events in their respective Kalpas, their process in being the cause of origin of one another is extolled by the sages. Now listen to their holy and wonderful story that releases from sins.

# 22-26.

Listen also to what happened to Brahma in his Kalpa. In the Kalpa, Meghavahana, Visnu became a cloud and showered the earth for a thousand divine years. Seeing this, Siva gave imperishable &#x3C;$akti to Visnu. Obtaining the Sakti from Siva Vi$nu created the universe along with Brahma. On seeing that glory of Vi$nu, Brahma created by him was seized by jealousy and said derisively. Go you, O Vi$nu. The cause of your origin is known to me. Rudra is superior to both of us. There is no doubt in this.

# 27.

It is due to the grace of that lord that you, the sustainer, have become a creator today.

# 28.

I too shall propitiate Rudra, the leader of gods, by means of penance and shall create the entire universe along with you. There is no doubt in this.

# 29.

Slighting Vi$nu thus, Brahma attained Siva by means of penance and submitted to him thus.

# 30.

O lord of the gods, O lord of the universe, Visnu is born of your left and I am born of your right side.

# 31.

Still Vi$nu created the universe along with me. Due to rivalry he was taunted by me depending on the strength of your support.

# 32.

“O Visnu, your piety towards the lord is not more than that of mine” (I told him) because our origin from you is on the same footing.

# 33.

O Siva, it behoves you to give all that to me also in the manner you bestowed on him before due to his devotion.



---

34. Thus implored by him the merciful lord Siva gave all to him as justifiable.

35. Thus obtaining the state of being the Atman of all in a trice, from Siva, Brahma hastened to and saw Viṣṇu.

36-41. He saw Viṣṇu lying on Śeṣa in his abode in the milk-ocean. A white canopy resembling the sun was spread. It was created by him mentally. It was set with gold and gems. Lord Viṣṇu had eyes resembling lotus. He had splendid body with four arms. He was bedecked in ornaments. He was holding conch and discus. His face shone like the disc of the moon. The scar Śrīvatsa marked his chest. He was smiling sweetly. His lotus-like feet attained red hue due to the contact of the lotus-like Lakṣmī. In Yogic slumber he appeared lying in the nectarine milky ocean. By the Guna of Tamas he was Kalarudra; by that of Rajas he was Brahma; by that of Sattva he was Viṣṇu. In Nirguna — he was lord Siva. On seeing him Brahma spoke seriously “O Viṣṇu, I am going to devour you as you did me formerly.”

42. On hearing this Viṣṇu woke up, saw Brahma and smiled slightly.

43. In the meantime Viṣṇu was devoured by Brahma and immediately created through the middle of the eyebrows.

44-47. In the meantime the moon-crested lord came to the place to test their Śakti. Though devoid of form he assumed a form in order to bless them as he had previously done. Both of them were delighted and frightened and so eulogised the lord and bowed to him with respect from a distance. The trident-bearing lord blessed them and vanished even as they watched him with respect.

203. The milky ocean is supposed to be identical with the Sea of Japan. See “geo. of the Puranas,” PP. 42-44.

204. Skt texts abound in descriptions of Viṣṇu reclining on Serpent Śeṣa. In this context, it may be noted that there is a vivid picture of Śeṣa-yi Viṣṇu on the outer wall of the Daśavatara temple at Deogarh (c. 5th cent. A.D).

# CHAPTER FOURTEEN

# (The manifestation of Rudras)

Vdyu said:

1. I shall explain the reasons for the manifestation of Rudra in every Kalpa whereby the broken series of Brahma’s creation is resumed.
2. After creating the subjects in every Kalpa, Brahma born of the cosmic egg felt excessively distressed. He was deluded.
3. In order to pacify his misery and to multiply his subjects, in the various Kalpas, Rudra, Brahma’s younger brother, becomes the son of Brahma and blesses him.
4. He alone is lord Isa, a mass of splendour, free from ailment, devoid of beginning and end, the creator and the lord making all living beings shrink.
5. Endowed with lordly qualities, he is purified by Paramesvara. He is presided over by his Sakti and marked by his symbols.
6. He has the same name, the same form; he can perform his task; he has the same function as he maintains and abides by his commands.
7. He resembles a thousand suns, he is bedecked in crescent moon. Serpents constitute his necklaces, shoulderlets and bangles.
8. He is brilliant holding the skulls of asura Jalandhara, Brahma, and Indra, his tawny hair, moustache and beard are drenched in the surging waves of Ganga.
9. His lips shine with the tips being hit by the sharp-pointed curved fangs; his ear-rings make a halo around his left ear.
10. He is seated on a great bull; his voice sounds like thunder. He is lustrous like fire, his strength and exploits are great.
11. He whose features are hideous in this manner and who is born as the son of Brahma bestows wisdom on him and co-operates with him in the activity of creation.
12. It is due to his grace that the creation in every Kalpa functions as a perpetual series.

1822 SioaPurtya

14. Once, when requested by Brahma to create, he mentally created all beings exactly like himself.

15. All of them had matted hair; they were free from fear and distress, had blue necks and three eyes, were free from decaying age and death; they had shining tridents as their excellent weapons.

16. The fourteen worlds of the universe were filled up by them. On seeing these various Rudras, Brahma spoke to Siva. “Obeisance you, O lord of do not create such subjects. Welfare to you. Create other subjects that may be endowed with death.”

17. When told thus, the lord replied to Brahma, “Such a creation is not my task. You alone create inauspicious beings.

18. The noble beings of great strength created by me mentally will walk about in my company. They will regulate the sacrifices.”

19. After saying thus to the creator, Siva the lord of living beings desisted from creation and remained in the company of Rudras.

20. From that time onwards the lord does not procreate auspicious beings. He stands in Yogic trance till the dissolution of the universe.

# CHAPTER FIFTEEN

# (Song of Prayer addressed to Siva and Siva)

Vdyu said:

1. When the creation of Brahma did not multiply, Brahma thought of creation by the process of sexual intercourse.

2. Since the race of women had not emanated from the lord formerly, Brahma could not produce creation through sexual intercourse.



---


1823

1. Then he finally resolved that the lord should be asked in respect of multiplying the subjects.
2. Thinking that without his grace the subjects will not increase, Brahma began to perform penance.
3. His primordial eternal Sakti is subtle, pure, pleasant and intelligible only through piety; it is devoid of attributes, unsullied, unramified, unruffled, perpetual and it ever remains with Isvara. Thus Brahma pondered over the lord and his great Sakti and performed penance.
4. Ere long the lord was pleased with Brahma who was endowed with severe penance.
5. Becoming half-female after introducing certain parts into a certain image, the lord himself came there.
6. On seeing the lord, Brahma eulogised him as well as the goddess, with hymns full of subtle meaning—the lord who is beyond darkness, is eternal, without a second, incomprehensible, invisible to the libertine, the creator, overlord, endowed with the creative power, who is beyond arguments, has no fallacious appearance, is immeasurable, unaging, stable, unmoving, devoid of attributes, quiescent, possessed of infinity, omnipresent, bestower of boons, devoid of difference between the Existent and the non-Existent, incomparable, worthy of being sought refuge and permanent. He prostrated before him and then stood up with palms joined with reverence. He eulogised him with faith and humility by means of hymns of subtle, sweet, refined and pious meanings that explained the Vedic texts.

Brahma, said:

O lord, be victorious. Isvara, MaheSvara, splendid with attributes, be victorious.
O auspicious goddess, O heroine of Prakpi and the one beyond Prakrti and naturally beautiful, be victorious.
O lord of fruitful Maya, of fruitful will, of great sports and of fruitful strength, be victorious.
O mother of the universe, O goddess identical with the universe, O creator and companion of the universe, be victorious.

V&#x26;yaviyasarhhitd 1825

31. O lord, where is your great splendour and where the worthless words of ours. Still O lord, forgive me that babble but with devotion.

32. After eulogising with these and similar hymns the four-faced lord, the creator of the universe bowed again and again to Rudra and Rudranl.

33. This holy and excellent hymn “Ardhanarisvara Stotra” uttered by Brahma enhances the delight of Siva and Siva.

34. He who recites this with devotion or teaches to anyone whatsoever reaps the fruit thereof as a result of the pleasure of Siva and Siva.

35. I bow to Siva and Siva the sanctifiers of living beings in the entire universe; the couple whose bodies are devoid of birth and death and who have taken the bodies of an excellent man and a youthful maiden.

# CHAPTER SIXTEEN

# [The manifestation of divine]

Vayu said:

1-3. Then the delighted god Siva spoke to Brahma with a benign and sweet smile. His voice sounded like thunder. All the letters were sweet, majestic, soft, clear, full and rich in meanings. They had royal qualities being pure and efficient in the protection of all subjects.

Lord Siva said:

4. Dear child, O fortunate one, the gravity of your statements has been understood by me.

5. It is for the increase in the number of the subjects that this penance has been performed by you. I am delighted with your penance. I shall grant you what you desire.

6. After this sweet and liberal speech the excellent lord created the goddess from a part of his body.

7. It is the goddess whom scholars of the Vedas call

the greatest Sakti endowed with the divine qualities of Siva the great soul.

# 8.

It was the goddess in whom there is neither birth, nor death nor old age nor other similar things. It was the goddess who manifested herself from the body of Siva.

# 9.

She from whom words recede along with the mind and the sense-organs, appeared to be born of a part of the body of her husband.

# 10.

The goddess who pervades everything through her greatness was seen like a wonderfully embodied being.

# 11.

It is she who fascinates the entire universe with her Maya. Really she is unborn but she appeared to be born of Siva.

# 12.

Her great form is not visible even to the gods. Such a great goddess of all the gods was divided in the body of her lord.

# 13-14.

On seeing the great omniscient, omnipresent subtle goddess, devoid of the difference between Sat and Asat, the goddess who illuminates the universe with her brilliance, Brahma bowed and prayed.

Brahma said:

# 15.

O Goddess in the beginning I was created by the lord and employed in the activity of the creation. I create the universe.

# 16.

O Goddess, the gods and others are mentally created by me. Though they are created again and again they do not increase in number.

# 17.

Hereafter I wish to increase the number through copulation.

# 18.

The race of women has not emerged from you. Hence I cannot create an everlasting race of women.

# 19-22.

Saktis originate from you. Hence I worship you alone who bestow Saktis upon everyone everywhere, who grant boons and who are Maya and the goddess of the gods. O omnipresent goddess for the increase of the mobile

and immobile beings, please be born with a part of yours, as the daughter of Dak$a my son. Thus requested by Brahma the goddess created a Sakti equal in splendour to herself from the middle of her eyebrows. Lord Siva looked at her laughingly and spoke.

23-25. “After propitiating Brahma with penance you shall carry out what he desires”. The Sakti obeyed the lord. At the instance of Brahma she became the daughter of Dakga. After giving the incomparable Sa*ti in the form of Brahman to Brahma, the goddess re-entered the body of the lord. The lord vanished. Since that time the enjoyment of sexual pleasures in women was established.

26. O leading brahmins, procreation functions through copulation. O leading sages, Brahma too was satisfied.

27. Thus the manifestation of Sakti has been narrated to you. It enhances merit. It shall be narrated with the story of creation.

28. He who recites this every day attains merits and obtains worthy sons.

# CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

# (The Narrative of Creation)

Vayu said: —

1-2. Securing the great and eternal Sakti from the lord and desiring to initiate the process of procreation by copulation, Brahma became a wondrous man in one half and a woman in one half. From the woman-half was born Satai upa.

3. The man-half created Viraja, called Svayambhuva Manu, the first creation.

4. Performing a difficult penance the gentle Satarup&#x26; got the Manu of bright fame as her husband.

208. Rudra S. I. 16. 11-12.

# Sivapurdna

# 3.

Satarupa bore him two sons, priyavrata and Uttanapada.

# 6.

She bore two daughters of great fortune from whom emanates all creation. They were Akuti and Prasuti.

# 7.

Lord Manu gave Prasuti to Daksa. Brahma gave Akuti to Ruci.

# 8.

The mental son Ruci begot of Akuti a son Yajfia and a daughter Daksina. The two make the universe whirl.

# 9.

Lord Daksa begot of Prasuti, the daughter of Svayambhuva, twenty-four daughters called the mothers of the world.

# 10-16.

Lord Dharma took thirteen of his daughters as his wives. They were Sraddha, Laksml, Dlirti, Pu?ti, Tu$ti, Mcdha, Kriya, Buddhi, Lajja, Vapu, Santi, Siddhi and Klrti the thirteenth. The other eleven were Khyati, Sati, Asambhuti, Smrti, Priti, Ksama, Sannati, Anasuya, Crja, Svaha and Svadha. O sages, the sages Bhrgu, Sarva, Marici, Angiras, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulastya, Atri, Vasistha, Pavaka and the Pitrs married them. Thirteen sons beginning with Kama and ending with Yasas were begotten by Dharrna of Sraddha and others happy and conducive to happiness. Nikrti and others were begotten of Hiriisa by Adharma. They bore the traits of Adharma and were conducive to unhappiness. They had no wives or sons. They practised no virtue.

# 17-21.

The Tamasa creation was controlled by Dharma. Daksa’s daughter Sati, wife of Rudra cast off her body as daughter of Daksa in the context of the insult offered to her husband. She rebuked Daksa and Daksa’s wife and their kinsmen. She was born as the daughter of Mena and Himavat. On seeing Sati how Rudra created many Rudras with lustres similar to his, has already been narrated. Bhrgu begot of Khyati the daughter Lak?mi who became the wife of Vi$nu. He begot two sons Dhatr and Vidhatr who became the founders of Manvantara. Their progeny is numerous, in hundreds and thousands.

# 22.

The descendants of Bhrgu lived in the Svayam-bhuva Manvantara. Sambhuti, son of Marici, gave birth to a son Paurnamasa.



---


# 23.

He had four daughters and descendants large in number. In that family was born Kagyapa who had many sons.

# 24-25.

Smrti, wife of Angiras, bore two sons Agnidhra and Sarabha and four daughters. Their progeny continued in thousands. Dantogni was born as the son of Priti the wife of Pulastya. He was Agastya in the previous birth in the Svayambhuva Manvantara.

# 26-27.

His descendants famous as Paulastyas were many. Ksama bore sons to Pulaha the Prajapati. The three known as Kardama, Asuri and Sahisnu had the splendour of the sacrificial fires. Their race is well established.

# 28.

Sannati, wife of Kratu, bore him sons who were equal to Kratu. They did not marry and hence were issueless.

# 29.

They were sixty thousand in number and known as Valakhilyas. They surround the sun and go ahead of his charioteer.

# 30.

Atri’s wife Anasuya bore five sons the Atreyas and a daughter Sruti, the mother of Sankhapada.

# 31.

The glorified five Atreyas are Satyanetra, Havya, Apomurti, Sanailcara and Soma.

# 32.

The sons and grandsons of the noble Atreyas are in hundreds and thousands. They lived in the Svayambhuva Manvantara.

# 33-34.

Seven sons were born to Vasitfha in Orja and a daughter Pundarikfi. They were Rajas, Gatra, Ordhvabahu, Savana, Anaya, Sutapas and Sukra.

# 35.

Their descendants with the names of Vasitfha were in hundreds and hundred millions all in Svayambhuva Manvantara.

# 36.

This is the creation of the sages. It is impossible to mention this in detail.

# 37.

Svaha, wife of the fire-god the mental son of Brahma in the form of Rudra, bore three sons of unmeasured splendour.

# 38.

They are Pavaka, Pavamina and Suci. Pavamina is the fire kindled by attrition. P&#x26;vaka is the fire produced by lightning.

39-40. The solar fire is called Suci. Their sons in order are:— Havyavaha, Kavyavaha and Saharak$as. They are the deities, manes and gods. Their sons and grandsons are fortynine.

41. They are propitiated in the three rites Kamya, Naimittika and Nitya. They shall be known as saintly observing holy rites.

42-46. These are in the form of Rudra and devoted to him. Whatever is offered in fire by whomsoever it may be is the offering to Rudra. This is the decision in regard to the fires stated in order.

44-47. O Brahmins, I shall describe the manes now but not in detail. The manes preside over the seasons. Hence the Vedas declare “The seasons are the Pitrs”. The mobile and immobile beings are created in the seasons. Hence it is mentioned in the Sruti, “The things produced in the seasons are the Pitrs.” Noble persons derive prosperity from the Pitrs who preside over the seasons. They stand in contact with the clouds. The Pitrs are of two types: Agni$vattas and Barhisads.

48-49. Householders are also of two types: Non-sacrificers, and Sacrifices. Svadha bore the Pitrs two daughters: Mena and Dharani who uphold the universe. Mena was the daughter of Agni§vattas and Dharani the daughter of Barhisads.

50. Mena, wife of Himavat, gave birth to Mainaka, Kraufica, Ganga and Gaurl sanctified by the embrace of Siva’s body.

51. Dharani, wife of Meru, gave birth to Mandara abounding in divine herbs and beautiful peaks of variegated forms.

52. Mandara the glorious son of Meru became the abode of Siva due to the strength of penance.

53. Dharani gave birth to three famous daughters eVela, Niyati and Ayati.

54. Ayati and Niyati became the wives of the sons of Bhrgu. I have mentioned to you about their race in Svayambhuva Manvantara.

55. Vela bore Sagara the holy daughter Savarna who became the wife of Pracinabarhij.

56. Samudri bore PracTnabarhis ten sons who were called Pracetasas. They were the masters of the science of archery.

57. Dak?a in Svayambhuva Manvantara became the son of the Pracetasas in the Cak?usa Manvantara due to the curse of Siva.

58-59. Thus the divine families, attended upon by the devas, of the noble-souled sons of Brahma, Dharma and others, have been described by me, O Brahmins. They observed holy rites. They had progenies and were embellished by great prosperity.

60. This creation born of the Prajapatis cannot be enumerated even in hundreds of crores of years.

61. Holy royal families function in two different lines viz. the solar and the lunar.

62. Iksvaku, Ambari$a, Yayati, Nahusa and others belong to those families well known and reputed.

63. There are several other saintly kings of different exploits. Of what avail is their detailed enumeration?

64. Moreover, in the context of the story of lord Siva, the eulogy of royal families is not approved of by good men. Thus I do not attempt to speak much.

65. Being relevant so far as it implies the greatness of lord Siva, I have mentioned creation. Enough of those details too.

# CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

# (The abandonment of the body by Sati)

The sages said:

1. How did the goddess, daughter of Dak?a become the daughter of Himavat and Mena after abandoning the body born of Dak$a?



---

# 2. How was Rudra censured by Daksa the noble soul?

What could be the cause whereby Siva was censured?

# 3. O wind-god, formerly in the Cak?u?a Manvantara how was Dak?a born due to the curse of Siva? Please narrate.

Vayfk said:

# 4. Please listen. I shall narrate the activity of the mean Dak$a resulting in his insult to all gods due to his sinful blunder.

# 5. Once formerly, all the gods, Asuras, Siddhas and the sages went to the summit of Himavat in order to see the lord. O Brahmins, the lord and the goddess were seated

# 6. on a divine seat as they granted interview to the gods and others.

# 7. At the same time Dak$a too had accompanied the gods in order to see Siva his son-in-law and the goddess his own daughter.

# 8. In view of their dignity, the lord and the Goddess did not give any special preferential treatment to Daksa.

# 9. But deluded that he was, Daksa did not realise the greatness of the lord and the goddess. Thinking her to be his daughter he began to nurse a grudge and hatred against her.

# 10. Due to this enmity and further incited by Brahma, Daksa after initiation did not invite them in the sacrifice.

# 11. He invited the other sons-in-law and honoured them severally.

# 12. On hearing from Narada that they had assembled there, Sati went to her father’s abode after informing Rudra.

# 13-19. She stepped into the aeroplane along with her dear friends. It was a divine plane with doors on all sides; had good conditions; could be easily mounted. It was very charming. It shed golden lustre. It was studded with jewels of various sorts and had a canopy covered with pearls. It was decorated with stringed flower garlands. It had been wrought in molten gold; hundreds of be-jewelled pillars supported it all round. The adamantine steps were neatly built. The columns and festoons were decorated with corals. The chief seat therein was studded with gems and

covered with a silken cloth with flower-designs. Through every aperture rays of diamonds were diffused; a good gemset platform without dents shone. A flagstaff as pure as cloud decorated its front with the sign of the great Bull. It was studded with jewels. The main door was guarded by invincible Garie£varas wearing jewel-studded bodices and wielding canes in their hands. Many women, experts in playing on Mfdangas, flutes, Vlnas and in music were seated there richly dressed and bedecked in ornaments.

20-21. Two Rudra virgins held the auspicious chowries and fans beautiful in their handles set with diamonds, and fanned the goddess. In the middle of the chowries the face of the goddess shone like a lotus in the midst of two fighting swans.

22-23. Sumalinl held over her head a pearl-stringed umbrella as white as the moon. The splendid umbrella shone above the face of the goddess as the moon's disc above the vessel of nectar.

24-25. Subhavati of sweet smiling face sat in front of Sat! and delighted her by playing at the game of dice. Suyagas held the auspicious sandals of the goddess, studded with gems, in the middle of her breasts and served the goddess.

26-27. Another lady held the glistening mirror. Another held the fan. Another held the betelbox. Another held the charming parrot.

28. A certain lady held charming fragrant flowers. Another lotus-eyed lady held the repository of ornaments.

29-30. A certain lady held the unguent, good flowers the auspicious collyrium. Other ladies did their respective duties. They sat around serving her. In their midst the goddess shone like the moon in the Autumn in the midst of a galaxy of stars.

31-32. Then after the blowing of the conch the great wardrum was sounded indicating the time of departure. Then hundreds of bugles and sweet-toned instruments sounded without being beaten (obstructed) along with the sounds of clapping the hands.

33-34. Then eight hundred groups of the thousand strong-

# 1834

SivapurSna armed Ganesas equal in brilliance to lord Siva went ahead. In their midst, the glorious chief of Ganas, honoured by the moon and NandHvara sat on the Bull like Brhaspati on an elephant.

35-37. The divine drums were sounded in heaven. Clouds were divinely pleasing. The sages danced. Siddhas and Yogins rejoiced. Everywhere on the way the clouds in association with the gods and others made showers of flowers above the canopy. The goddess entered her father’s house as if in a moment.

38. On seeing her Dak?a became infuriated which subsequently became the cause of his destruction. He worshipped her younger sisters too in an insulting manner(?).

39. Then the goddess spoke to her father in the midst of the assembly, relevantly unexcitedly and undemeaningly.

The goddess said:

40. O father, the lord at whose bidding everyone from Brahma to the Pi£acas becomes subservient has not been duly worshipped.

41. Let that alone. Why did you slight me your eldest daughter in a despicable manner?

42. Thus addressed, the infuriated Daksa replied angrily “The younger daughters are better than you. They deserve my special reverence.

43. Their husbands evoke my respect and joy, for they are superior to your husband lord Siva.

44. He is stiff-souled and you have resorted to him. So I dishonour you. He is antagonistic to me.”

45. Thus insulted the infuriated goddess spoke to her father within the hearing of all present there.

46. O Dak$a, you insult my husband the lord of the world, whose insult no one has hitherto made.

47. The Sruti says that these are great sinners viz. a stealer of learning, a traitor to the preceptor and an insulter of the Vedas and of the god. They deserve to be punished.

48. Therefore a terrible punishment befitting the great sin shall be meted out to you by divine intercession.



---


49. Since the lord of gods has not been worshipped by you, know that your family is defiled and ruined.

50. After saying thus to her father Sati abandoned her body and without fear went to mountain Himavat.

51. The glorious leader of mountains attained the fruit of his merits. It was for her that he had performed penance for a long time.

52. The goddess blessed the lord of mountains. Through her Yogic Maya and at her own will, she made him her father.

53. When Sati rebuked Dakṣa and went away, the frightened and agitated Mantras too vanished. The sacrifice became hindered.

54. On hearing about the departure of the goddess, Siva was angry with Dakṣa and the sages and cursed them.

55-57. O Dakṣa, since for my sake the sinless Sati had been dishonoured and the other daughters worshipped along with their husbands, these sons-in-law of yours will be born but not of a womb in the sacrifices of Brahma in the Vaivasvata Manvantara. In the Cakṣusa Manvantara you will become a king as the grandson of Pracinabarhi and the son of Pracetas.

58. O wicked one, there also I shall put up obstacles before you in all activities regarding virtue, wealth and love.

59. Thus addressed by Rudra of unmeasured splendour, Dakṣa abandoned the body and fell on the ground.

60. Then in the Cakṣusa Manvantara Dakṣa was born as the grandson of Pracinabarhi and the son of Pracetas.

61. Bhrgu and others were born in the Vaivasvata Manvantara in the sacrifice of Brahma bearing the bodies of Varuna.

62. Then in the Vaivasvata Manvantara in the virtuous sacrifice of the wicked Dakṣa the lord created obstacles.



---

# CHAPTER NINETEEN

# The origin of Vfrabhadra

The sages said:

1. How did the lord create obstacles before the wicked Dak?a who performed a sacrifice for virtue's sake? We wish to know this.

Vdyu said:

2-4. When Himavat was delighted by becoming the father of the mother of the universe by the strength of his penance, when Siva married her and sported with her in his abode on the peak of Himavat when a long time elapsed, in the Vaivasvata Manvantara Dak?a as the son of Pracetas wanted to perform a horse-sacrifice.

5. On the top of Himavat in an auspicious spot at the source of Ganga, frequented by the sages and the Siddhas Dak?a began his sacrifice.

6. All the gods Indra and others gathered there and thought of going to attend the sacrifice.

7-8. The Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Sadhyas, Maruts, O?mapas, Somapas, Ajyapas, Dhumapas, Asvins, Pitrs, and the other sages came there along with Vi§nu to take part in the sacrifice.

9. On seeing the gods assembled there without Siva, all Dadhlca became angry. He spoke to Dak$a thus.

Dadhica said:

10. Indeed that man incurs great sin who does not worship those who deserve worship and worships those who do not befit it.

11. Lord’s terrible punishment¹⁰ falls where the wicked are honoured and the good are dishonoured.

After saying this the sage spoke again to Dak?a.

12. The statement is reminiscent of the concept of Divine origin of punishment well expounded in the Bhlfma-Yudhifthira dialogue in the £P of the MB.

“Why don’t you worship the lord deserving worship, the lord of souls?”

Dakfa said:

1. I see eleven Rudras armed with tridents and having matted hair. I do not know anyone else as the lord.

Dadhica said:

What avails worshipping the gods in the sacrifice if the king of sacrifice, Rudra, is not worshipped by you?
He is unchanging, the creator of Brahma, Vi$nu and Rudra, to whom all from Brahma to Pi£acas, say “What shall we do?” He medi-
He is beyond all Prak^tis and Puru$a. is tated upon by Yogic scholars, sages and the seers of truthful principles.
He is the imperishable great Brahman, the Sat-Asat and Asat; devoid of beginning, middle and end, incomprehensible and eternal.
He is the creator, sustainer, and annihilator. I do not see any one else in the form of Siva in the sacrifice.

Dakfa said:

I offer this Caru in the golden vessel, sanctified by mantras, after assigning the share to Vi$nu the lord of sacrifice.

Dadhica said:

“O Dak?a, since the lord of the chief of the gods is not propitiated your sacrifice will not be efficacious.”
After saying this, the infuriated sage Dadhica left for his hermitage.
Even when the sage walked out, the gods did not leave Daksa in view of the inevitability of the disaster that was to take place.
O brahmins, in the meantime knowing about all this from Siva the goddess urged the lord to destroy the sacrifice of Dak$a.
Urged by the goddess the lord created the heroic Virabhadra the chief of Ganas, intending to destroy the sacrifice.

# Sivapur&#x26;na

25-33. He had a thousand faces, a thousand lotus-like eyes. He was holding a thousand iron clubs, thousands of arrows, spear, axe, mace, bow, discus and the thunderbolt. He looked fierce and terrible. The crescent moon adorned his crest; the thunderbolt illuminated his hands. His hair shone like lightning. He had a huge mouth terrible with the curved fangs and a huge belly. His tongue was like lightnings. His lips hung down. His voice sounded like the cloud and the ocean. He wore the tiger’s hide dripping with blood. He ear-rings formed circles close to his cheeks. He had adorned his crest with the garlands from the heads of leading gods. He was bedecked in golden shoulderlets and jingling anklets. He was shining with heaps of gems. His chest was covered by necklaces. He was equal in exploit to the great fabulous animal Sarabha, tigers and lions. His gait was gentle and majestic as that of a stately elephant in rut. His lustre was white like conch, chowrie, Kunda flower, moon and the lotus-stalk. He was like the snow-capped lord of mountains who had become mobile. Flames surrounded him. Wearing pearl ornaments he shone brilliantly as the fire at the dissolution of the world.

34. That chief of Ganas knelt and bowed. With palms joined in reverence he stood beside the lord of gods.

35. With his anger he created Bhadra the goddess Kali as a witness of his activities and his companion.

36. On seeing Virabhadra standing like deadly fire in the company of Bhadra, Siva said “Welfare be to you.”

37. He submitted to the lord in the company of the goddess. “Please command what task shall I carry out?”

38. Then with a desire to please Parvati, Siva spoke to the huge-armed Virabhadra in raised sound.

The lord of gods said:

39. O chief of Ganas, accompanied by Bhadrakali, destroy the sacrifice of Daksa the son of Pracetas.

40. O chief of Ganas, I shall witness your exploit staying near Raibhya’s hermitage along with the goddess.

In the place Kanakhala21 there are huge trees near Gangadvara218 resembling the mountain with the golden peaks like Meru214 and Mandara215. Daksa is holding sacrifice there. Immediately create obstacles in that sacrifice too. Do not delay.

# 43-44.

When this was mentioned by the lord, the goddess, daughter of Himavat looked at Virabhadra and Bhadrakall as does a cow at her calf. Embracing him and sniffing at his head as at the head of Subrahmanya216 she smiled and spoke in sweet voice.

# The goddess said:

# 45.

O dear Bhadra, O blessed one, of great strength and exploit, you are born to carry out the task that pleases me. Wipe off my anger and sorrow.

# 46.

In view of his enmity Daksa is performing a sacrifice without inviting the lord of sacrifice. O chief of Ganas, split that sacrifice.

# 47.

At my bidding O dear, inflict violence in the company of Bhadra. Kill the sacrificer. Let the holy sacrifice be turned into non-sacrifice.

# 48.

At the behest of Siva and Siva of wonderful activities, with bent head, as if it was their blessing, Bhadra bowed to them and left.

Then the universe with all its open spaces and crevices was covered with the chiefs of ganas equal in exploit to Bhadra.

These had thousand hands holding thousands of weapons and had the lustre of Rudra.

# 54.

They had spears, tridents and maces, axes, stones and rocks. They resembled deadly fire and Rudra. They had three eyes and matted hair.

# 55.

They flew in hundreds and seated on lions roared loudly like clouds.

# 56.

Lord Bhadra surrounded by the Bhadras shone like Kalabhairava surrounded by hundreds of deadly fires at the time of dissolution.

# 57.

In their midst, mounted on a lordly bull and with a bull-emblem, lord Bhadra went ahead like Siva seated on Nandin.

# 58.

When Bhadra was seated on the bull, Bhasitaprabha held the pearl umbrella and the white chowries.

followers entered the golden gate of the sacrificial altar.

67. Then the chief of Ganas Bhadra entered like Rudra desirous of burning the worlds at the time of dissolution.

# CHAPTER TWENTY

# (The destruction of Dakfa's sacrifice)

Vdyu said:

1. Then he saw the great Satra of the gods of great splendour the chief of whom was Visnu. The satra had all the paraphernalia—the flags of various colours etc.
2. Good grass was scattered in straight lines. The sacrificial fire was well-kindled. It was embellished with glittering sacrificial vessels of gold.
3. The rites were performed neatly in accordance with the rules found in the Vedas by the sages who were experts in sacrifices and who performed the rites properly.
4. Thousands of celestial damsels were there. The Satra was attended by the Apsaras. The sweet sound of flutes and lutes spread and was enhanced by the sound of Vedic hymns.
5. On seeing all this, the heroic Virabhadra of great exploits roared like a lion or a majestic rumbling cloud.
6. Then a hurrah of joy, filling the sky and superseding the sound of the ocean was produced by the lords of ganas.
7. Overwhelmed by the great sound the frightened heaven-dwellers ran helter-skelter dropping their garments and ornaments.
8. “Has the great Meru been burst? Is the earth pierced through? What is this?” the gods began to scream and shout.
9. Some abandoned their lives due to fear like lordly elephants in a thick forest on hearing the roar of the lion.
10. Mountains crumbled. The earth quaked. Winds rolled and reeled. The ocean was agitated.

1. Fires did not blaze. The sun did not shine. Neither the planets nor the stars nor the other luminary bodies shone.

12. In the meantime lord Bhadra in the company of Bhadras and the goddess Bhadra reached the brilliant sacrificial altar.

13. On seeing him, Daksa stood steady and firm though he was frightened. He spoke angrily “Who are you? What do you wish?”

14-15. On hearing the words of the wicked Daksa, Virabhadra of great splendour and of majestically rumbling sound like the cloud smilingly looked at Daksa, the gods and the Rtviks. He spoke the relevant words full of meaning without the least excitement.

Virabhadra said:

16. We are the followers of lord Siva of great splendour. We have come for our share. May that be given to us.

17. If the share has not been allotted to us in the sacrifice let the reason be mentioned or let the gods fight with me.

18. When they were told thus the chief of Ganas said to the gods headed by Daksa “The mantras are our authorities. We are not the lords.”

19. The Mantras said — “O gods, your minds are oppressed by Tamas. Hence you do not deserve the first share. Worship lord Siva.”

20. Though advised by the Mantras the gods with deluded minds did not offer the share to Bhadra. They desired to drop him out.

21. When their truthful and wholesome words went in vain the Mantras turned away from that place and went to the eternal Brahmaloka.

22-23. Then the chief of Ganas spoke to the gods headed by Visnu, “You have not accepted the mantras being proud of your strength. Since we have been dishonoured.

by the gods thus in this sacrifice, I will drive out your arrogance along with your lives.

24. After saying thus the infuriated lord burnt the sacrificial altar with the fire of his eyes as Siva had burnt the three Puras.*17

25-26. Then the lords of ganas of mountain-like huge bodies uprooted the sacrificial posts and tied them to the necks of the Hotr priests by means of ropes. They broke and powdered the sacrificial vessels of various shapes and sizes, dissolved them in water and hurled all the appendages of the sacrifice in the currents of the Ganga river.

27-28. There were heaps of foodstuffs and beverages; milk flowed like rivers exuding nectar; curds formed smooth slimy slush. Sweet smelling meat and foodstuffs lay in heaps high and low. There were juicy beverages, and foodstuffs to be lapped up. The heroes ate, chewed and scattered them.

29-30. The heroic Bhadras born of Virabhadra’s body hit and split the haughty gods including the guardians of the quarters by means of discus, thunderbolts, spears, Siktis, nooses, iron clubs, iron rods, swords, axes, Bhindipalas and huge battle-axes.

31-32. “Chop off and split” “Hurl quickly” “Let him be killed” “Take away and strike” “Peel and tear off” such ruthless words full of excitement, usual in wars and jarring to the ears arose from the lords of Ganas.

33-36. Some roiled their eyes, gnashed their fanglike teeth and bit their lips and palates. They pulled out the sages in the hermitages and killed them. They took away sacrificial ladles and spoons and hurled them into fire and water. They broke domes, gemset platforms. They sang, shouted and laughed again and again drinking blood-like wine. The leading Ganas danced.

37. Pounding up the gods including Indra, the leading Ganas, strong like lordly bulls, elephants and lions, of unrivalled glory, perpetrated hair-raising deeds of destruction.

217. The three cities or castles of the Asuras T&#x26;raka, VidyunmSli and Maya were received as gifts from Brahma pleased by their penance. These were destroyed with a single shaft by Siva who was annoyed at their savage activities. 1 rof Agrawal considers the burnings of Tripuras as historical event.

38. The Pramathas rejoiced, struck, ran, prattled, danced, laughed and jumped about.

39. Some of them evinced a desire to seize the watery clouds, some jumped up to seize the sun; others wished to blow along with the wind.

40. Some wielded weapons and rushed through the sky like peaks of mountains; tossed the gods like the Garucja tossing huge pythons.

41. Some looking like the black clouds uprooted the houses, windows, daisies, hurled them into water and roared.

42. The doors, door-frames and walls of the sacrificial mansion were upset; the windows, ceiling frames, the halls were destroyed utterly. The complete edifice of sacrifice crumbled helplessly like a statement without foundation.

43. While houses were being dismantled, the women shrieked and cried helplessly “O husband” "O Child” “O father” “O brother” “O mother” “O uncle.”

# CHAPTER TWENTYONE

# ( The punishment of the gods )

Vayu said:

1. The chiefs of gods headed by Vāyu and Indra were terribly afraid. They fled in excessive fright.

2. Seeing that the gods had fled uninjured and thinking that those who deserved to be punished remained unpunished the leading Gana became angry.

3-4. He took up the all-destroying trident and looked up. He vomited flames from his mouth, chased the gods as the lion chases the elephants. His gait as he pursued them resembled that of an elephant in its rut.

5-7. Then he agitated the army of the gods as the lord of elephants in rut stirs up a lake, shedding different hues blue, grey and red. He wore a tiger’s skin as his cloth which was inlaid with excellent gold and pearls. Cutting, piercing,

moistening, tearing and pounding, Bhadra moved among the hosts of the gods like fire consuming dry grass.

8-9. As he walked about speedily armed with a spear all alone, the gods thought him to be numbering a thousand. The infuriated Bhadrakali excited by the fight pierced through the gods in the war holding spears shedding flames.

10-11. Bhadra born of Rudra's anger shone in her company as the fire at the time of dissolution with a lustre pale and smoky due to smoke. Pursuing the gods in the course of war, Bhadrakali shone as the flame of fire at the end of the Kalpa that burns the universe.

12-15. Bhadra the leader of Rudraganas angrily kicked the sun and his horse on the head sportively with his left leg. The heroic Ganesvara, Bhadra with self-control hit Pavaka with his swords, Yama with iron-clubs, Rudras with his spear and Varuna with iron clubs. Holding the axe he hit Vayu with it and Nirjrti with big clubs. The war was a sportive game for him. He attacked the gods and the sages antagonistic to Siva.

16. Then the lord cut off the tip of the nose of Sarasvati as well as of the mother of the gods with the tip of his nail.

17. With a dagger he chopped off an arm of Vibha-vasu, and the tongue up to two inches from the tip, of the mother of the gods.

18. The lord nipped off the right nostril and the nipple of the left breast of Svaha with his nail-end.

19. The impetuous Bhadra uprooted the eyes of Bhaga large and lustrous like the lotus.

20. With the end of his bow he hit Pusan's pearl like row of teeth. Thereafter Pusan could not utter words clearly.

21. Then the lord stamped the moon with his toe, as though he was only a worm and ground ‘him on the ground.

22. The infuriated Bhadra cut off the head of Dak$a and handed it over to Bhadrakali even as Virini, wife of Daksa was lamenting.

23. Taking up the head resembling the fruit of a

palmyra the goddess played with it like a ball in the battlefield.

24. Then the sacrifice itself was hit and smashed with feet and hands like fallen women hit by their husbands.

25-26. Catching hold of by the neck, Aristanemi, Soma, Dharma, Prajapati Angiras, father of many sons, Krsasva and Katyapa, the powerful chiefs of Ganas of leonine exploits rebuked and hit them on the heads with fists.

27. Just as in Kaliyuga women of noble families are molested and defiled by paramours forcibly so also the women and the daughters-in-law were molested by Bhutas and Vetalas.

28-30. Thus the sacrificial spot appeared like a desolate forest. The domes were smashed. The posts were broken. The festivities ended. The hall was burnt. The portals and festoons had crumbled. The army of the gods was uprooted. The sages were killed. The Vedic chant had subsided. The population had dwindled. The distressed women shrieked. The appendages were spoiled.

31. The excellent gods fell on the ground with their arms, thighs and chests pierced, with the heads cut off with the trident.

32. When thousands of gods were killed and their bodies lay sprawled on the ground, the chief of Ganas entered the place of sacrificial fires.

33. On seeing that Bhadra resembling the deadly fire had come the sacrifice was afraid of death and fled assuming the form of a deer.

34. Bhadra pursued him drawing his great bow, terrible due to the twanging sound of the firm bow-string, and discharging the arrows.

35. He sounded the bow by drawing the string to the ears like the thundering cloud. The bowstring, heaven, sky and earth reverberated.

36-37. The sacrifice was terrified on hearing the sound, ‘O I am doomed’, he thought. He was trembling with the legs shaking. His lustre disappeared. He ran in the form of a deer. The heroic Bhadra, with a half curved arrow, decapitated him.

38. On seeing the sacrifice thus insulted, Visnu was infuriated and got ready for a fight.

39-41. Garu^a the devourer of serpents and the king of birds bore him speedily over his shoulders. The god Indra and others who had escaped helped him as if ready to abandon their lives. Seeing them along with Vi$nu like the lion viewing the jackals the lord of Bhutas laughed. He looked like a lion without distress.

# CHAPTER TWENTYTWO

# (The destruction of Doha's sacrifice)

Vdyu said:

1. At that time a chariot resembling a thousand suns and with the emblem of a bull on the banner cloth appeared in the sky.
2. The splendid chariot had two horses and four wheels. Several divine weapons and missiles had been kept ready therein. It was embellished with jewels.
3. It was driven by the same charioteer who drove Siva’s chariot in the latter’s war with the Tripuras.
4. At the bidding of Siva, Brahma brought the excellent chariot to Virabhadra and spoke with palms joined in reverence.
5. “O lord Virabhadra the eternal moon-crested lord commands you to mount the chariot.
6. O great-armed one, Siva, stationed near the hermitage of Raibhya along with Siva, is witnessing your unbearable exploit.
7. On hearing his words and blessing Brahma, the heroic leading Gana mounted the divine chariot.
8. In the excellent chariot where Brahma sat as the charioteer the splendour of Bhadra increased like that of Rudra, the enemy of the Tripuras.
9. Then keeping an excellent conch shining like the

# Sivapurdna

full moon, in his mouth, the powerful Bhanukampa blew on it.

10. At the sound of the conch resembling that of the swan, the fire in the belly of the gods blazed with fear.

11. In an instant the quarters including open spaces and crevices were filled up and thronged with leading Yaksas, Vidyadharas, serpents and Siddhas who desired to witness the battle.

12. Then Narayana as the cloud inflicted pain on the Ganas as the cattle, through a great shower of arrows from his bow.

13. On seeing Visnu coming and discharging arrows Bhadra took up his bow and showered thousands of arrows.

14. He took up the divine bow and slowly drew it like Siva who drew the bow Meru.

15. As the bow was drawn a loud report was produced shaking the earth.

16. Then the chief of Ganas, of fierce valour and glory took an excellent arrow blazing like a serpent.

17. His hand in contact with the opening of the quiver for taking up the arrows appeared like a serpent wishing to enter an anthill.

18. The arrow lifted and held in the hand shone like the young one of a serpent held within the mouth of a great serpent.

19. With his stout and sharp arrow, the infuriated Bhadra who resembled Rudra, hit the unchanging Visnu on his forehead.

20. Vi$nu thus insulted and hit on the forehead became angry with the chief of Ganas like a cow or bull becoming angry with the lion.

21. Then he hit the serpent like arm of the chief of Ganas, with a cruel, pointed great arrow resembling the thunderbolt.

22. The powerful Virabhadra too, with a great velocity discharged an arrow brilliant like ten thousand suns again at his arm.

23. Visnu hit Bhadra. Bhadra hit Visnu. O brahmins both of them hit each other.



---


24. The tumultuous hair-raising fight between the two discharging the arrows on each other in quick succession then ensued.

25. On seeing their mutual noisy battle the sounds of *Ha-Ha* raised by the aerial wanderers rose in the sky. Vi$ou

26. Then Bhadra hit in the broad chest of with an arrow that shone like the sun and the tip of which blazed like fire.

27. Acutely hit by the arrow that fell sharply, Vi«>u suffered great pain and fell into swoon.

28. He regained consciousness instantaneously and got up. He discharged his weapons against Bhadra.

29. The chief of the army of Siva stopped all the missiles discharged from Vi§nu*s bow by means of terrible anti-missiles.

30. Then Visnu with eyes reddened by anger discharged an arrow in which his name had been engraved and which had never been obstructed anywhere, against the Gana chief. Showering arrows, lord Bhadra split the arrow into pieces on the way before it reached him.

31-33. Then within an instant he split the bow with a single arrow and the wings of Garu<ja with="" the="" two="" arrows.="" this="" was="" a="" wonderful="" feat.="" then="" by="" his="" yogic="" powers="" vi?pu="" let="" loose="" from="" body="" thousands="" of="" terrific="" gods="" holding="" conch,="" discus="" and="" club.="" but="" mighty="" bhadra="" burnt="" all="" them="" instantaneously="" means="" fire="" eyes="" like="" siva="" who="" tripuras.&#x3C;="" p="">
</ja>
34-36. Thus infuriated Visnu raised his discus in a hurry and attempted to hurl it on the hero. On seeing him in front with the discus lifted up, the chief of the Ganas smiled and without any strain made his hand stiff and benumbed. With his limbs turned numb, Vi?nu became incapable though he was desirous of hurling the unequalled and terrible discus.

37-39. Gasping for breath with a hand holding the discus he stood idly, immobile like a stone, like the soul without a body, like a bull without a horn or like a lion without its fangs. So stood Vi?nu. On seeing Vi?nu in a miserable plight the infuriated Indra and other gods took up their wea-

# Sivapur&#x26;na

They hastened to fight with the chief of Ganas like cows or bulls attempting to fight with a lion.

On glancing at them as a lion glances at the deer, Bhadra of Rudra’s body, the hero surrounded by excellent heroes, benumbed them with a boisterous laugh.

The right hand of Indra who desired to release the thunderbolt it held remained steady as painted in a picture.

The hands of others too became fixed, as the activities of idle men at the start remain unprogressive.

Thus the gods with their efficacy thwarted in the battle were rendered incapable of standing in front of him.

Frightened by the splendour of Virabhadra they could not stay further in the battle. In that fierce battle they fled even with their benumbed limbs.

The mighty Virabhadra hit the fleeing warriors, with sharp arrows like the cloud hitting the mountains with sharp showers.

The multitudinous arms of Virabhadra, resembling iron clubs, shone with their various shining weapons like serpents with fiery flames.

The hero discharging weapons and missiles shone like Brahma discharging (creating) all living beings.

Just as the sun covers the earth by his rays so the hero enveloped the quarters by means of his arrows.

The arrows of the Gana chieftains embellished with gold and flying in the firmament like lightning became the standard of comparison.

The great arrows took away the lives of the gods even as the water snakes squeeze the lives out of the frogs. They drank their blood as though that were wine.

The hands of some had been cut off. The faces of some had been split. Some gods fell on the ground with their sides lacerated and bruised.

With their limbs shattered by the arrows, joints severed and eyes dislocated they fell dead on the ground. Some desired to enter the earth and some wished to go up to the sky. Being unobstructed they merged into one another. Some entered the earth. Others entered the caves of mountains. Others went up to the sky. Still others entered the water.



---


55-56. With the gods with their limbs cut off, the hero shone like Bhairava who had seized people and like Siva who had burnt the three cities.

57. Thus the entire army of the gods was dejected and looked hideous. They had their bodies mutilated by the Gapesvara.

58. Then a terrible stream of flood from the bodies of the warriors began to flow striking terror in the living beings.

59. The ground of the sacrificial rites drenched with the blood shone like the goddess Kausiki who had killed Sumbha with her garments wet with the blood.

60. When the extremely terrible battle had concluded the earth quaked as though frightened terribly.

61. The ocean was agitated with the surging waves, foams and whirlpools. Meteors fell portending great evil. Trees shed down their branches.

62-64. The quarters looked gloomy. Inauspicious wind blew. Ah, the adverse working of the fate. This is a horse-sacrifice. The sacrificer is Daksa himself. Dharma and others are the councillors. The Garuda-bannered deity is the patron. Indra and other gods take their shares directly. Still the sacrificer, the sacrifice and the priests are beheaded immediately.

65. Hence no such action shall be performed that is not indicated in the Vedas, and that which excludes Siva and is taken up by the wicked.

66. A person devoid of devotion to Siva does not attain the fruit of any rite even though he may perform holy rites and sacrifices.

67. Even committing any great sin, if one worships Siva with devotion he is liberated from the sin. No hesitation need be made in this respect.

68. Of what avail is much talk? If anyone censures Siva, the charitable gifts he makes, the penance, the sacrifice, the homa, everything goes in vain.

69. Then the gods including Visnu and the guardians of the quarters pierced by the arrows discharged from the bow of the chief of Ganas and overwhelmed by great pain fled from the battle.

The warriors of the gods with their hair dishevelled.

moved about. Some sat exhausted with their huge bodies. Some fell with their faces cut and some perished.

71. Some fell in adversity with their garments, ornament weapons and missiles scattered. Eschewing their pride, arrogance and strength they fell evincing signs of dejection.

72. Destroying Dak$a’s sacrifice, performed in the wrong way, by means of weapons the invincible lord of Ganas shone amidst the leading Gagas like the lion in the midst of bulls.

Vdju said:

1. Thus the gods headed by Visnu with their bodies split and mutilated attained a miserable plight and trembled. Only a few of them survived.
2. 2-3. The excessively infuriated Pramathas and Ganas urged by Virabhadra seized the warriors frightened of the battle tying their hands, feet, shoulders and bellies by means of strong iron fetters.
3. In the meantime Brahma who had secured his favour due to his charioteership, implored Bhadra, the devotee of the daughter of Himavat.
4. “O lord, enough of this fury. The gods are ruined. Please forgive their faults. O you of auspicious rites.”
5. Implored thus by Brahma the delighted chief of Gagas became calm.
6. Getting the opportunity through Brahma the gods joined their palms in reverence above their heads and eulogised him by various hymns.

The gods said:

Obeisance to Siva the quiescent. Obeisance to the trident-bearing destroyer of sacrifice. Obeisance to Bhadra, the lord of Rudras, the wealth and prosperity of Rudras.

9. Obeisance to Rudra the deity of deadly fire; to the slayer of death and Kama; the remover of the heads of the gods and of the wicked-souled Dak?a.

12. Thus eulogised the lord was satisfied. He set gods free from fetters. He took them to the presence of lord Siva.

13. Siva, the omnipresent lord of the worlds, was standing in the firmament along with the Ganas.

14. On seeing him the gods headed by Vi?nu were pleased and awe-struck. They bowed to him.

15. Seeing them frightened, Siva the destroyer of the distress of his devotees said laughingly after glancing at Parvati.

Lord Siva said: —

16. O gods, do not be afraid. You are my own subjects. It is only to bless you that the punishment has been meted out to you by the merciful lord.

17. The transgression of you the gods has been forgiven by us. When we are infuriated you have neither sustenance nor life.

Vayu said: —

18. Thus spoken to by Siva of unmeasured splendour the gods immediately had their doubts cleared. The gods danced joyously.

19. Becoming delighted and excited in their minds with bliss, the gods began to eulogise Siva.*

The gods said:

20. O lord assuming the forms of Brahma, Visnu and Rudra through Rajas, Tamas and Sattva you are the creator, protector and the annihilator of the worlds.

O omniformed, O conceiver of the universe, O sanctifier. O formless, O bestower of happiness you take up forms only for the sake of devotees.

O Siva, O lord of gods, it is due to your favour that the moon became free from ailment, when dead she plunged into Yamuna and regained life and happiness.

Simantinl whose husband had died, O lord, attained unequalled marital bliss by worshipping you. By performing the holy rites on Mondays she bore sons.

The lord gave excellent region to Srikara. You protected Sudarsana from the fear of danger from the hosts of kings.

The storehouse of mercy enabled Medina to cross the ocean of worldly existence. By your miraculous activity you enlivened the husband of Sarada.

Destroying the calamity of Bhadrayus you conferred happiness on him. By serving you Saumini became free from worldly bondage.

Vifnu said:

O Siva you are Brahma, Visnu and Siva by means of the Gunas Rajas, Sattva and Tanias. With the desire to bless the people you became the creator, sustainer and the annihilator.

You are the destroyer of the arrogance and the brilliance of everyone. You are the hidden secret of all lores, the cause of blessings for all.

O lord, everything originates from you. You are all. Everything is in you. Save us again Please be merciful on me.

In the meantime, getting the opportunity Brahma bowed to him with palms joined in reverence and informed the trident-bearing lord.

Brahma said:

O lord, be victorious. O destroyer of the distress of your devotees, who else other than you becomes pleased when offences are of this nature?

# 33.

The faults in the offences committed by the gods, lord, is actually blessing because of the weightiness of your acceptance. I consider so.

# 34-35.

When Brahma implored thus, the lord smiled and glanced at the face of the goddess. As a result of his affection to Brahma who was like a son unto him, the lord revived the gods to life.

# 36.

He restored the goddesses mothers of the gods who had been punished by the Pramathas and others.

# 37.

Lord Brahma made the face of Dak?a look like the face of an old goat as a befitting punishment for his sins.

# 38.

He was resuscitated and endowed with good intellect. On seeing Siva he was afraid. With palms joined in reverence he eulogised Siva.

# 39.

O lord of the universe, O cause of the blessing for the worlds, O lord, be merciful. Forgive my guilt.

You are the creator, protector and the annihilator of the worlds. This has been known by me particularly. You are the lord of Visnu and all others.

Everything is spread and pervaded by you alone, created and destroyed by you alone. Visnu and other lords are not superior to you.

The lord, the storehouse of mercy glanced at the guilty one who was emotionally distressed and smilingly said “Do not fear”.

# 43.

Saying so and with a desire to please his father Brahma, the lord bestowed on Daksa the imperishable chief-tancy of the Ganas.

Then Brahma and other gods saluted the lord with palms joined in reverence. In words of humility they eulogised the lord.

Vdyu said:

50. Thus eulogised by Brahma and other gods lord Siva, the ocean of mercy, favourably disposed towards the devotees was pleased.

51. Siva favourably disposed to the distressed blessed Brahma and other gods and delightedly granted them boons.

52. Then the merciful lord who made their fear subside addressed the gods who had sought refuge in him, with words characterised by smile.

Siva said:

53. On seeing you all seeking refuge in me your entire guilt and sin committed as if urged by fate, has been excused by us.

54. O gods headed by Visnu, Brahma and Indra return happily to Devapura unmindful of the present suppression and without the sense of shame in your minds.

# (Siva's sports on the Mandara mountain)

The sages said:

1. Where did Siva who vanished along with the goddess and his attendants go? Where did he stay? What did he do and not do?

Vqyti said:

The excellent mountain Mandara21 with different caves became the pleasing spot of penance for lord Siva.
He had performed a great penance for the privilege to support Siva and Siva on his head. After a long time he felt the pleasure of contact with their lotus like feet.
The beauty of the mountain cannot be mentioned in detail by persons with thousand faces even in hundreds of crores of years.
Even if it is possible to describe I do not attempt to describe its beauty lest it should stand comparison with the other beautiful mountains.
This is possible to mention that it has the beauty of being qualified to be the residence of the lord through some supernatural magnificence.
That was why the lord made this mountain as his harem with a desire to do what was pleasing to the goddess.

The slopes of the mountain abounding in rocks and trees humiliate the universe due to the perpetual presence of Siva and Siva.

The mountain renders help to the parents of the worlds with light and clean waters of the streams cool to

During the nights when the moon remains at the outskirts of its peaks the mountain shines with the imperial umbrella in the form of the moon.

# 12.

When the tresses of the womenfolk of the gods shake, he appears as being fanned by the chowries signifying his Emperorship.

# 13.

In the morning when the sun rises, the mountain embellished with jewels and gems appears to be eager for observing the beauty of his body in a mirror.

# 14-15.

This king of mountains appears to be honoured with benedictions of victory by the trees that seem to be sages with the twining growths of creepers for the matted hair; through the chirping of vociferous birds, by extending their arms in the form of creepers shaken by the breeze and shedding flowers and tender sprouts.

# 16-19.

With the various peaks some facing down, some shooting up and some projecting sideways he appears to jump into the nether worlds, jump up from the ground, fly through the sky in all directions. Through the vast caves he appears to have kept his mouth gaping. He appears to see the universe and dance continuously. His beauty never fades nor wears out. He appears to stretch himself to devour the universe, to drink the ocean; to vomit the darkness within and to cover up the sky with clouds.

The different abodes have mirror-like surface. The tall shady trees in the hermitages set the blazing sunshine at nought.

23. Reaching the garden there along with the goddess, lord Siva sported about in the divine harem grounds.

24. As time elapsed and population increased, two demons were born. They were two brothers Sumbha and Ni£umbha.

25. As a result of the power of their penance Brahma granted them the boon that they would not be killed by any man in the universe.

26-27. Brahma was requested by them thus “Our death may take place in a battle with the lady with whom we fall passionately in love. She shall be a virgin born of Siva’s part, not from any womb. She should not have experienced the sexual contact with any man. Her exploit shall be unthwartable.” Brahma had consented to their request.

28. Ever since, the two demons wrought havoc in the universe. They defeated Indra and other gods in war. They abolished the study of the Vedas and offering to the gods.

29-30. Then Brahma requested Siva, the lord of the gods for killing them — “It behoves you to bestow on the gods the goddess who will kill Sumbha and Nisumbha. She shall be the Sakti born of the sheath of Siva’s colour. She shall be in the form of a virgin devoid of passion. By rebuking her secretly or by infuriating her this shall be arranged.

31-32. Thus requested by Brahma, the lord Nilalohita called Kali in secret outwardly rebuking her while smiling within. The goddess Kali was angry by her allusion to the colour. Derisively and forcibly she spoke to her husband thus. The goddess said:

33. “If my lord has no pleasure in my complexion how is it that I have been held up here so long.

34. If you are displeased with me why do you sport with me? There is nothing in this universe which is unachievable for my lord, the lord of the universe.

35. To my lord taking delight in the soul, happiness is not derivable from sexual indulgence; for the very reason Kama was reduced to ashes.

36. The life of the lady most beautiful in limbs is in vain though she may possess all other qualities if her husband is not delighted with her.

37. The creation of women rests solely in the enjoyment of her husband. That being the case, where can a woman who is contrary to that be used?

38. Hence, eschewing this colour censured by you in secret I shall attain another colour or I shall cease to exist myself.

39. After saying this she stood up from the bed. Bent upon penance she requested for the permission of her lord in words choked with emotion.

40. Then lord Siva, afraid of a rupture in love, replied to her falling at her feet. Lord Siva said:

41. “O beloved, why are you angry with me, not knowing that this was only a jocular remark of mine. If I am not delighted with you, where else can I seek delight?

42. If I am not delighted with you how can it be proper since you are mother of this universe and I am its father and lord?

43. Is our mutual love generated by Kama? Even before the birth of Kama the universe existed.

44. The deity Kama was formulated by me for the sexual pleasure of men and women. Then why did you taunt me for having burnt Kama?

45. The mind-born Kama considered me on a par with the gods. While he attempted to tease me I reduced him to ashes.

46. Even our sport and pastime is meant for the universe. For that very purpose I have made this jocular remark.

47. That purpose ere long will be revealed to you.” On hearing this the goddess, remembered the remark that caused her annoyance and said.

The goddess said:

48. “O lord, your jocular remarks I have heard before whereby I have been deceived though I am very bold.

49. Even an auspicious lady of a noble family who does not abandon her life incurs the displeasure of her husband and is held despicable by good men.

50. Your displeasure is very great because I am not fair. How is the remark “Kali” relevant otherwise though it be a jocular remark?

51. Dark complexion is hated by good men. You too disapprove of it. Without wiping it off by dint of penance I am not inclined to stay here.

Siva said:

52. If your distress is such, of what avail is penance? You can assume any other colour at my will or at your choice.

The goddess said:

53. I do not wish to have any other colour either at your will or at my choice. I shall propitiate Brahma by penance and become Gauri.

Siva said: O goddess, Brahma attained his status formerly by my grace. What will you do by invoking him through your penance?

The goddess said:

55-56. True that Brahma and other gods acquired their status only from you. Still at your bidding I propitiated Brahma formerly and in the name of Sati I became Daksha’s daughter and attained you, the lord of the worlds, as my husband.

57. So now also by propitiating him by penance I wish to become Gauri. What is the harm therein?

58. Thus replied to by the goddess, Siva did not insist on his point as he desired to carry out the task of the gods.

# CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE

# ( The goddess attains fair complexion)

Vdyu said:

1. Then circumambulating the lord and restraining the pangs of separation she went to the mountain Himavat.
2. Out of love she selected the same spot for her penance where she had formerly performed the same along with her friends.
3. She visited her parents at their house and bowed to them. Informing them of her intention and securing their permission she went to the penance-grove and discarded her ornaments. She took her bath and assumed the holy dress and features of ascetics. She performed the very difficult penance. She meditated upon the lotus-like feet of her lord. She conceived the same in Siva’s external phallic emblem in accordance with the injunctions. In the three junctions of time every day she worshipped the same with the flowers and fruits of the forest. Thinking — “He thus me alone, after assuming the form of Brahma, will grant the fruit of this penance”, she conducted the penance.
4. After some time had elapsed, seeing her performing the penance a huge tiger approached her with wicked intention.
5. The body of that animal of wicked soul became stiff and benumbed when he approached her.
6. Even after seeing the tiger that approached her with wicked intention the goddess did not turn away from her pious thoughts like ordinary people.
7. The animal with his body stunned and overwhelmed with hunger, stood there in front of her glancing perpetually at the goddess and thought, “My prey is nothing else.” Virtually this became his cherished goal.
8. Mercy was generated in the heart of the goddess who thought, “He is the perpetual performer of contemplation on me and my protector from the wicked animals.”
9. By this feeling of mercy the threefold dirt of the tiger perished and he realised the goddess.

# Vdyavtyasarhhitd

# 1863

15. His hunger receded. The benumbed stiffness subsided. His congenital wickedness disappeared. Contentment set in.

16. Realising his contentment with great piety he waited upon the goddess as a sudden devotee.

17. He roamed about the penance-grove as a router of wicked animals and wicked souls.

18. The penance of the goddess increased and became gradually acute. Meanwhile the gods sought refuge in Brahma due to the pressure of the Daityas.

19. The gods submitted to him how Sumbha and Nisumbha inflicted pain on them due to their strength derived from the boons.

20-21. On hearing the distress of the gods Brahma grew merciful. He knew how Daityas could be destroyed. On being requested he went to the penance-grove of the goddess along with the gods reflecting in his mind that the liberation of the gods from misery could be achieved through his effort.

22-23. Brahma saw the goddess, the mother of this universe, the mother of Trinity, the daughter of the lord of mountains, the foundation of the universe, firmly engaged in penance. On seeing her he was delighted.

24. On seeing that Brahma had come along with the gods, the goddess offered him Arghya and received him with words of welcome.

25. Replying suitably and congratulating her the lotus-born Brahma asked her the purpose of her penance as though he did not know.

Brahma Said:

26. What is being striven for, goddess, by means of this penance? The benefits of penances are under your control.

27. The fruit of the penance has been obtained by you in having obtained lord Siva as your husband, who alone is the lord of all worlds.

28. Or all this is only a form of your divine sport. But this is surprising how you can bear separation from the lord.



---


# Sivapur&#x26;na

The Goddess said:

29. When at the beginning of creation as mentioned in the Vedas you are born of lord Siva you are the first of my creation, my first-born son.

30. When for multiplying the subjects, Siva was born of your forehead you became my father-in-law and so elder to me.

31. When the lord of mountains, my father became your son you became my grandfather, O grandfather of the worlds!

32. How can I inform you, the arranger of worldly existence what happened at the harem with my husband?

33. Of what avail is this talk? I wish to get rid of my dark complexion through legitimate remedies and obtain white colour.

Brahma said:

34. O goddess, why did you perform a severe penance for this purpose? Was not your wish alone sufficient for that? Indeed this is only your sport.

35. O mother of the universe, your play too benefits the worlds. Hence some benefit pleasing to me may be sought through it.

36. Two Daityas, Sumbha and Nisumbha to whom I had granted boons have turned arrogant. They are harassing the gods. Their destruction is only through you.

37. Do not delay. For a short while be steady. The Sakti that is to be released now shall be their death.

38. Thus requested by Brahma, the goddess, daughter of the mountain, cast off her outer skin and became white.

39. The outer sheath thus cast off became KauSiki who is known as Kali, the virgin with the lustre of the black cloud.

40. She is the Sakti in the form of Maya, the Yogic slumber of Visnu. She held the weapons, conch, discus, trident in her eight great arms.

41. She had three traits: gentle, terrible and a mixture of the two. She had three eyes. She was moon-crested.

VSyaviyasarhhitS 1865
had not experienced the sexual contact of any man. She was invincible and beautiful.

42. This eternal Sakti was given to Brahma by the goddess as the would-be destroyer of Sumbha and NiSumbha, the leonine Daityas.

43. A very powerful lion that came there, was given to her as vehicle by the delighted Brahma.

44. He fixed her abode on the Vindhya mountain. He ordained her worship by the gift of meat, fish, pies and wine.

45-46. That &#x26;akti, approved of by Brahma, the creator of the universe, bowed to her mother Gauri and Brahma in due order. Surrounded by many Saktis equal to her and born of her she proceeded to the Vindhya22¹ ready to slay the leading Daityas.

47-48. The leading Daityas were killed by her in battle, the Daityas whom the arrows of Kama pierced in the minds and her own arrows split and pierced in the bodies. That battle is not described here as it has been described elsewhere. It can be guessed through other sources as well. I shall resume the present description.

# CHAPTER TWENTYSIX

# (The attainment of higher status by the tiger)

Vayu said:

1. After creating KauSiki and handing her over to Brahma, Gauri spoke to Brahma demanding the recompense.

The goddess said:

2. Is this tiger that has resorted* to me seen by you? He has guarded my penance grove from wicked animals.

3. Dedicating his mind to me he worships me without thinking of anything else. There is nothing more pleasing to me than his protection.

22i See P. 623 note 69

# 4.

He shall be appointed as an official in my harem. Out of pleasure Siva will grant him the post of Gane£vara.

# 5.

I wish to return with my friends keeping him ahead. I seek permission from you the lord of the subjects.

# 6.

Thus addressed, Brahma smiled and told the goddess describing the lion’s wicked antecedents as though the goddess was unaware. Brahma said:

# 7.

O Goddess, animals are cruel. How can your blissful thought be directed to these? Why do you sprinkle nectar in the mouth of the serpent?

# 8.

This is a certain night-prowling wicked demon in the garb of a tiger. Cows, Brahmins and saints have been devoured by him.

# 9.

He is roaming about assuming forms as he pleases, pleasing and propitiating them. The fruit of a sinful action must of necessity be reaped by him.

# 10.

Why shall mercy be shown to wicked souls like this? What is the purpose served by one innately sinful?

# The goddess said:

# 11.

What you have said is entirely true. Let him be like this. Still he has resorted to me. One who has sought refuge in me shall not be abandoned.

# Brahma said:

# 12.

I narrated his antecedents without realising his devotion. If there be devotion, sins are not effective? Your devotee never perishes.

# 13.

What can a man of virtuous rites achieve without depending on your behest? You alone are the unborn, intelligent, ancient goddess.

# 14.

Bondage and liberation depend on you. There is no greater Sakti than you. Without you rites cannot achieve results.

# 15.

You alone constitute Sakti of living beings. Himself incompetent to do anything what will a mere agent do?

# 16.

It is only your behest that is the cause of acquisition.

# 1867

tion of prosperity and glory by Vi?nu, by me or by any of these—gods, Danavas or Rak$asas.

17. Innumerable Brahmas, Vi$nus and Sivas have passed by. Such innumerable ones are yet to be born, these carry out your behests.

18. O goddess of the gods without propitiating you the fourfold arms of life cannot be acquired by all of us.

19. Since merit and evil have been established by you the mobile and immobile may even be inter-changed.

20. You are the primordial and eternal Sakti of Siva the great soul, the lord of the universe, the Sakti without beginning, middle or death.

21. For the functioning of the universe you assume some form or other and play about in different aspects. Who knows you factually?

22. Hence let this wicked tiger too attain the great Siddhi by your blessings. Nothing can prevent it?

23. Thus requested by Brahma after duly reminding her of her great aspect the goddess ceased from her penance.

24-29. Then taking leave of the goddess Brahma vanished. The goddess visited her parents Mena, Himavat. She bowed to them and alleviated the pangs of her parents due to her absence. The goddess then proceeded to Mandara talking to her friends about the trees in the penance-grove who had been her loving companions. “They are shedding tears due to their grief at separation, by their scattering flowers, they are crying in distress by the chirping sound of birds seated on their boughs.” The goddess was impatient to see her lord. She kept the tiger ahead thinking him as son born of herself, out of affection. With the brilliant lustre of her body she illuminated the quarters. — Thus Gauri reached Mandara where lord Siva was staying the lord who is the creator, protector and annihilator of the worlds.

# CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN

The sages said:

1. After assuming fair complexion how did the goddess, the daughter of the excellent mountain look at her husband on entering the mansion?
2. What was done by the Ganetas at the portals at her entry? What did the lord do?

Vdyu said:

It is impossible to narrate adequately such an exquisite sentiment couched in love whereby the imagination of all sentimental people has been captured.
She was received by the doorkeepers in full flutter and agitation. The lord was eagerly awaiting her arrival. Entering within the mansion she hesitatingly glanced at the lord.
She was welcomed by the inmates of the mansion with loving feelings. She was saluted by the Gana chiefs with words of welcome. She bowed to lord Siva.
After bowing no sooner did she get up than the lord seized her with his hands, embraced her and joyously walked her round. Even when he attempted to make her sit on his lap she sat on the couch. Smilingly he seized her from the couch and made her sit on his lap. Smilingly gazing at her with his wide open eyes as if he would drink her in, the lord initiated the conversation with her by speaking himself first.

The lord of the gods said:

O lady, exquisitely beautiful in every limb, has that condition of yours passed wherein no means of pacification is fruitful due to your anger?
O lovely lady, I do not mind whether you are Kali or of any other complexion. My mind is attracted by your innermost feeling. How did this concept escape your

memory ? Out of our will we have accepted physical bodies. Causes dirtying up the mind do not crop up there.

12. Should there be any cause for our mutual displeasure as in the case of ignorant fellows, the whole world consisting of the mobile and immobile beings would cease to exist.

13. I am stationed on the head of Agni. You are stationed on the head of Soma. This universe in the form of “Agnisoma” is presided over by us both.

14. We move about for the welfare of the universe. We have taken up physical bodies out of our free will. At our separation the universe is left without support.

15-16. There is another reason based on Scriptural texts and independent arguments. The universe comprising the mobile and immobile beings is integrated as words to their meaning. You are the nectarine word. I am the nectarine meaning. How can the two nectars become disjointed?

17. You are the lore that makes my conviction possible. I am the object of knowledge on the basis of your conviction. How can we separate inasmuch as we are in the forms of knowledge and object of knowledge?

18. I am not creating and re-creating this universe merely by my activity since everything gets evolved through command or behest. You are the great command.

19. Lordship has behest as its core because it is the symbol of freedom. How can there be lordship in me if I am deprived of command?

20. We can never stay apart from each other. It was for accomplishing the task of the gods that I made that joke.

21. It was not unknown to you that you got angry? It was for the protection of the worlds that you feigned anger towards me.

22-24. What is harmful to the living beings does not find room in you. When lord himself spoke thus the goddess, the natural source of love, smiled but did not reply to her husband. Out of bashfulness she did not say anything but gave an account of Kaurikl.

# Sivapurtna

The goddess said —

25. Was not Kau€iki, created by me seen by my lord?

Such a girl has never been before in the world nor will ever be.

26-27. Brahma will tell you about her prowess, strength, residence on the Vindhya, her victory in the battle with Sumbha and Nisumbha, their death, her blessing to the devotees and her protection of the worlds.

28. At the behest of the goddess who spoke thus Her friends brought the tiger in their presence.

29. On seeing him the goddess spoke again "O lord, see this tiger. There is no other devotee of mine like him.

30-32. My penance-grove was guarded by him from wicked hosts. He is greatly devoted to me. In view of his protecting me he is trustworthy. He has left his native place and come here for your favour. If you are pleased with him and if you love me, O god, let him stay at the door of the harem along with the other guards and under the charge of Nandin himself.”

V&#x26;yu said:

33-34. On hearing the auspicious, loving and sweet words of the goddess the lord said to him “I am pleased”. Immediately he was seen like Ganesa wearing the dress and features of a watchman, holding the cane made of gold and a dagger of serpentine lustre and wearing a bodice set with various gems.

35. He was named Somanandin because Soma means Siva and this tiger pleased Soma as well as Nandin.

36. After carrying out this task pleasing to the goddess the lord with the circular moon on his crest embellished him with divine ornaments set with gems.

37. Then lord Siva with the moon as his ornament made the majestic beautiful Gauri the daughter of the lord of Himavat sit on the conch and embellished her with ornaments.

# CHAPTER TWENTYEIGHT

# ( The glory of Bhasma)

The sages said:

1. We wish to hear these things in the proper order. What was it mentioned by the lord while pacifying the goddess? He had said that the universe is in the form of Agnisoma. He had said that it was in the form of words and their meanings. He also mentioned lordship has command as its core. You are that command.
2. Vdyu said: The body of Rudra which is fiery and terrible is called fire. The moon pertains to Sakti. It is nectarine and is the body of Sakti that causes calmness.
3. What is called Amrta is Pratistha. Tejas is Vidya and Kala itself. In all the subtle elements the two are predominant, viz, Rasa and Tejas.
4. Tejas functions in two ways, in the form of the sun and of fire. Rasa too functions in the form of the moon and of water.
5. Tejas is lightning etc. Rasa is sweet etc. The universe of the mobile and immobile beings, is sustained by Tejas and Rasa.
6. Amrta issues from Agni. Agni increases through Amrta. The powerful Agnisoma is beneficent to the universe.
7. The luxuriant growth of Vegetation is for the Havis. The rain contributes to the flourishing growth of vegetation. So Havis is the outcome of rain, the universe is sustained by Agnisoma.
8. The Agni blazes upwards as far as the great Amrta of Soma. The Amrta of Soma flows as far as the support of Agni.
9. That is why the Kalagni 'stays below and the Sakti upwards. The upward blazing is till burning and the downward flow is till complete drenching.
10. The Kalagni supported by Adhara Sakti proceeds upwards. Similarly Soma having its region in Siva-Sakti flows downwards.

1872                                                Sivapurana

# 12. Siva sustains Sakti from below and Siva is Sakti-dhara (upholder of Sakti) above. Thus there is nothing not pervaded by Siva and Sakti.

# 13. Frequently the world consumed by fire is reduced to ashes. They call it Agnivirya because Bhasma constitutes the powerful part of the same.

# 14. He who dusts himself with Bhasma repeating the mantra “Agniriii5” etc., if bound becomes free from bondage.

# 15. Bhasma which is Agnivirya when drenched with Soma is conducive to the lordship of Prakrti without having recourse to Yogic union.

# 16. But being drenched all iound by having recourse to Yogic union the Bhasma may turn one back from lordship by the shower of Amrta belonging to Sakti.

# 17. Hence for the conquest of death the drenching with Amrta shall be perpetual. How and wherefore shall one die if the nectarine contact of Siva and Sakti is acquired?

# 18. He who knows the secret of burning and drenching as mentioned is never reborn after leaving the world, the region of Agnlsoma.

# 19. He who burns his body with Saivite fire and drenches it with the nectar of Sakti and Soma attains immortality.

# 20. —It was after keeping this in mind that the lord had said “The universe is in the form of Agnisoma.”

# CHAPTER TWENTYNINE

# [The analysis of Vag-Artha]

Vdyu said: —

# 1. I shall mention briefly how the universe in the form of ‘Vag-Artha’ can be known through the six pathways.

# 2. There is nothing that is not the meaning of a word.

u22. See P. 1730 note 157



---


There is no word without meaning. Therefore all words make all meanings known in their proper time.

1. The two words and their meanings are the transformations of Prakrti which is form of Siva and Siva.
2. The magnificence in the form of word is mentioned as threefold by scholars—gross, subtle and the great. The gross one is what we hear with our ears.
3. The subtle one is in the form of thought, the one beyond is devoid of thought. The Sakti based on the principle of Siva is Parasakti. In the name of “Sakti Tattva” it is the root cause of all effects. It is the composite unit (Samasti) of all Saktis because it is in association with Jnana Sakti and is supported by Iccha sakti. The same is called Kundalini Maya and Suddhadhvaparama. This Sakti is ramified into six paths. The three paths pertain to words and the three pertain to their meanings.
4. The capacity for merging and enjoyment is possessed by all men in accordance with their purity based on the divisions of all Principles. The principles are pervaded by Kalas suitably as in the beginning the great Prakrti is transformed into five. They are Kala, Nivrtti and others.
5. The three paths based on words are: the path of mantras, the path of words, the path of letters. The three paths based on meanings are the path of universe, the path of principles, the path of Kalas. These are mutually pervaded and pervading.
6. The mantras are pervaded by the words constituting the statement. The words are pervaded by letters. Learned men call the group of letters a word.
7. The letters are pervaded by the words because they are obtained there. The words are pervaded by the Tattvas because of their origin from within and without. They are effected by the Tattvas in various ways. Some of the words have cropped up from the middle, some from the Śaiva Agamas. Some of Tattvas are those famous in the Sankhya and Yoga systems of Philosophy. Others are famous in the sacred texts of Siva. The Tattvas are duly pervaded by Kalas.
8. Since in the beginning the primordial Prakrti is



---



1874 Sivapurdna transformed into five Kalas, Nivrtti and others pervaded by each other.

19. The undivided Sakti pervades the six paths. She is pervaded by Sivatattva.

20. Everything from Sakti to Earth is born of Sivatattva and pervaded by it alone just as pot etc. are pervaded by clay.

21. The great abode of Siva is attainable through six paths. The non-pervading Sakti becomes pervasive by the purification by five Tattvas.

22. The situation of the cosmic egg upto Rudra is purified by Nivrtti. Above that upto the sphere of Avyakta It is purified by Pratistha.

23. Above that upto VisveSvara it is purified by Vidya in the middle. Above that it is purified by Santi. At the end of the path the purification is through Santyatlta.

24. It is this they call the greatest firmament in view of the contact with Paraprakrti. These are the five Tattvas whereby the entire universe is pervaded.

25-26. All this could be seen only there by the aspirants. He who wishes to purify without realising the mode of pervasion of the paths is a deceiver of purity. He cannot achieve the fruit. His effort is wasted and leads him to hell.

27. It is not possible to know the Tattvas factually nor their pervasiveness nor increase without the union of Sakti and the individual soul.

28. Sakti is the order of Siva in the form of cit. With that as the cause Siva presides over everything.

29. It is not of the nature of the Atman nor of Maya nor of secondary nature. It is neither bondage nor liberation but it causes bondage and liberation.

30. She is the acme of Siva’s lordship never swerving. By means of sensations she is of the same traits as he.

31. With her alone he is a householder and with him alone she is a housewife always. As a result of their union the universe is the offspring.

32. Their difference is specified in this that he is the



---

VSyavtyasarhhitd
maker and she is the cause. The single Siva himself stands two-fold. 843

33-34. Some declare that their difference consists in their genders: man and woman. Others say that she is undetachably associated with him as the light of the sun. But in the form of cit she is different. The arrangement is that Siva is the great cause and his behest is the great goddess.

35-36. Urged by his behest the original unchanging Prakrti becomes threefold in accordance with the three types of effects. It is called Mahamaya, Maya and Triguna Prakpti. It produces the six paths in the form of words and their meanings. The entire universe is thus sixfold. The whole collection of scriptural text is only an extension of this.

# CHAPTER THIRTY

# (The principle of Siva)

The sages said:—

1. The activities of deities of domestic nature are curious, dense and inscrutable, even to the gods. They delude our minds.
2. In the union of the principles of Siva and Siva no defect is noticeable. However in their activities the Prakfta feeling is rather prominent.
3. Brahma and others the causes of creation, sustenance and annihilation attain restraint and blessing from Siva and are subservient to him.
4. Siva is not subject to anyone’s Nigraha and Anugraha. Surely his lordship is not dependent on any one else.
5. If his lordship is like this, characterised by freedom, it can be either innate or subject to his embodied state.

223. Matsya P. 3. 3 1 JWWW I In the half male and half female form (arforftenc ^t) Siva symbolises the progenitive principle.

6. But a physical form does not fit in with a free being for this basic reason. But the form is an effect of some cause. Lordship has no cause for its being.

7. Everywhere the greater and the lower Bhavas are mentioned. How can these two be relevant in one place?

8. Indeed the great Atman is devoid of attributes. How can he become possessed of attributes? Svabhava is unrecertifiable.

9. If you say that his innate nature is reverted by his own wish he being free, why does not Isana make an interchange in permanent and non-permanent things?

10. The wise have said that the embodied Atman is Sakala; the unembodied Siva is Niskala. The embodied Atman is presided over by Siva.

11. If it is contended that the embodied Atman is the form of Siva, the dependence of the embodied on the form becomes certain. How can we explain that?

12. Otherwise how is the form adopted by the non-dependant? The adoption of form is with a purpose to get the fruit of his desire.

13. The assuming of physical bodies out of wish is not consistent with freedom. Such a wish too follows the activities of men.

14. Even beings including Brahma and PiSacas can assume or cast off their bodies out of their wish. But don’t they come under the scope of Karmans?

15. They consider the assumption of bodies at one’s choice on a par with jugglery. It is not beyond the achievements derived from Anima and other powers.

16. While Visnu who had assumed the cosmic form was fighting with Dadhica the latter assumed the cosmic form of Visnu.

17. Although Siva is the great Atman and superior to all, his similarity with other beings is observed by us because he has a body.

Ser RS II. Ch.

Vayaviyasarhhit
18. They say that Siva the supreme cause blesses us all. He curbs and kills the gods. How can he be a blesser of all?

19. The lord cut off the fifth head²²⁵ of Brahma who stubbornly and repeatedly censured Siva calling him “O son.”

20. In the form of a Sarabha he forcefully attacked Visnu the man-lion. Pressing him with his feet he tore off his heart by his sharp claws.

21. With the sacrifice of Daksa for a pretext none among the gods or their womenfolk was spared from punishment by the heroic VIrabhadra.

22. The three cities 226 along with the Daityas, their womenfolk and children were made the fuel for the fire from his eyes in an instant by him.

23. Kama the husband of Rati, the cause of the sexual pleasure of the people was consigned to the fire from his eyes even as the gods were lamenting.

24. Angrily glancing at some cows walking along the sky and shedding milk over his head he reduced them to ashes immediately.

25. The demon Jalandhara who bound Visnu and his Serpent and hurled them a hundred Yojanas, was pierced after evolving a discus by making a circle in water with the foot 227.

26. He then killed him with his trident in the water (?). By performing penance Visnu secured the discus and became powerful.

27. The family of cruel demons who desired to kill him was scorched in fire. The chest of Andhaka was pierced with the trident.

28-29. After creating a dark woman from his neck he killed Daraka. After creating KausikI out of the outer skin of Gauri, Sumbha and Nisumbha were killed. The narrative on Skanda is found in the Skanda Purana.

30. The lord, requested by Brahma for the destruction of the leading Daitya Taraka229 the enemy of Indra, went to his harem on the Mandara mountain.

31-32. The lord indulged in sexual dalliance with the goddess for a long time. Due to the excessive sport the earth appeared to sink into the nether worlds. He deceived his own name and the goddess by withholding the discharge of semen in her. The unbearable semen was discharged into the fire like nectar or the sanctified Havis.

33-34. The fire cast it off into Ganga and other places. Svaha who assumed the form of the Krttikas and sported with her husband gathered the parts and deposited them in the Sara plants somewhere on the Meru. Svaha was turned into gold in the process.

35. After some time her lustre illuminated quarters and the mountains. Meru itself was turned into gold.

36. After a long time the splendour grew into a boy of beautiful and tender limbs, a model for all boys.

37. On seeing him of charming features, the world of the gods, Asuras and mankind was surprised and fascinated.

38-40. The lord himself came there along with the goddess to see his son. He took the boy on his lap. The gods and the sages though averse to worldly pleasures glanced at his smiling face. The lord made him play on his chest and enjoyed the fun. The lord and the goddess congratulated each other.

41-45. He asked the goddess to feed him on her breast-milk. He blessed him saying “your incarnation is for the welfare of the world.” The lord and the goddess were not satiated. Indra who was afraid of the demon Taraka joined in alliance and performed the coronation of the infant as the commander-in-chief of the gods. The lord vanished himself keeping him in the protection of Indra and the gods. Taraka’s head along with Indra’s fear was chopped off by his trident in battle, the trident that resembled the deadly fire and pierced the Asura Kraufica. Visnu, Brahma and other gods particularly eulogised him.

46-47 Ravana, king of Rak?asas, arrogant of his prowess lifted up Kailasa with his long arms. Siva, the trident-bearing lord of the gods could not brook that sin. He pressed it with his big toe and the demon sank under the pressure.

48. For a brahmin boy whose life came to an end and who sought refuge in him, the lord came there hurriedly and kicked Yama with his foot.

49. The submarine fire, not knowing the bull as the lord’s vehicle swallowed him. Thereafter the universe became a vast sheet of water.

50. By means of different activities blissfully beautiful and unknown to the people, the universe has been set to motion frequently.

51. If Siva is calm and blesses all, he shall fulfil all desires. Being competent why does he not liberate?

52. The variety of beginningless Karmans cannot be the restraining factor here. The Karman that is the cause is also effected by the lord.

53. Of what avail is much talk? Maruta, please explain in detail so that the arguments of atheism may be refuted quickly.

# CHAPTER THIRTYONE

# (Instruction in perfect wisdom)

Vdyu said: O brahmins, but proper that you have had your doubts prompted by sufficient reasons. Mere desire to know does not bring about atheism in those with good intellects.

1. I shall mention authoritative testimonies in this context quelling your delusions. The wickedness of the wicked is due to the absence of the grace of the lord.

2. It is clear and certain that nothing can be done without the grace of Siva, the perfect and supreme soul.

1880 Sivapurdna

# 4.

Innate good nature alone is the sufficient ground for the lord’s benediction; nothing can be blessed without innate good nature.

# 5.

The universe in the form of Pasu and Pa£a, has to be blessed. The lord endowed with the authority blesses the universe.

# 6.

The lord, the commander blesses everything always. If a means is adopted for that, how does Siva become dependant?

# 7.

No blessing can be independent of one that is blessed. Hence the meaning of the word freedom is not characterised by ‘not depending on another’.

# 8.

That which is to be blessed is accepted as ‘depending on another’. Without blessing, the enjoyment of pleasures or liberation cannot take place.

# 9.

Embodied Atmans too stand in the category of those who are to be blessed. Siva’s blessing is construed in the form of driving out their ignorance. There is nothing in Siva influenced by ignorance.

# 10.

Siva in the form of the idol, whereby despite its beings Saguna the Niskala is realised, is called Saivamurti only in a figurative use.

# 11.

Actually in the Niskala form Siva is not the cause of the universe. In the Sakala form too he has not been seen by any.

# 12.

The state of being understood through the testimonies alone indicates his nature. Merely on account of this it should not be treated with indifference without the implication.

# 13.

Some form, intense with the similarity of Atman, is Siva’s idol. The other, the great one, the Atman of the Mfirti is its implication.

# 14.

Just as fire cannot be obtained without its being mounted in the twigs so also Siva is not known or understood without its being superimposed in the idol.

# 15.

If some one says “Bring fire,” only the burning twig is brought. The fire by itself is not brought. In the same way Siva is to be worshipped in the form of the idol.

# 16.

That is why an idol is used in the worship of Siva.



---


# Vdyaviyasuifikita

# 1881

for what is done unto the idol is what is done unto Siva himself.

17. In the form of different idols, phallic etc. and particularly in Area (offerings of flowers etc.) Siva is worshipped by us.

18. Just as the Atman of the idol is blessed by the great Atman so also we, the pal us, are blessed by Siva stationed in the Murtyatman.

19. The Murtyatmans, Sadasiva and others are presided over by Siva for blessing the worlds.

20. It is for the enjoyment of pleasures and for salvation in particular, that Siva’s connection with the Murtyatmans in the form of Tattva and Atattva is accepted.

21. Enjoyment of pleasures is in the nature of the ultimate transformation of the Karmans either by way of happiness or by way of misery. There is no Karman in Siva and hence of what nature can his enjoyment be?

22. Siva blesses every one. He does not curb any. It is impossible to attribute to Siva those faults which are usually present in those who kill.

23. The instances of killing and curbing pointed out with regard to Brahma and others are those of the activities of Srikanthamurti performed for the welfare of the worlds.

24. Surely Srikantha has the overlordship of the universe. Siva presides over the Murti Srikantha in the course of his divine sport.

25. Only the gods and others who were faulty were restrained or slain by him as described above. Thereby the gods became sinners and the people free from ailments.

26. Restraining or killing as such is not declared despicable by the learned. That is why the punishment meted out by kings to those who deserve it, is commended.

27. If he does not have that which is achieved through the suzerainty of the whole class of effects how can he rule over the universe?

28. The wish of the lord comprises the establishment of rules and conditions. Brahma is the commandment. His order is the mode of direction such as, 'This shall be done. This shall not be done.'



---


# 29.

The characteristic of a man of good nature is the strict adherence to his directives; the opposite thereof is that of the non-saintly one.

# 30.

If good nature is to be preserved the evil one is to be eschewed. It is quelled by the expedients of Sama etc. If other means fail punishment alone is the means.

# 31.

This is the characteristic of what is beneficent viz. chastisement ending with disciplinary measures. What is contrary to this is called maleficent.

# 32.

The lord is the standard example of those who perpetually abide by what is beneficent. How can he be condemned by good men for curbing and killing the evil ones alone.

# 33.

Perpetrators of improper actions are to be decried and despised by a judicious person. Improper action is that which afflicts and harasses the world.

# 34.

Every act of curbing and restraining is not attended with hatred. A father who trains his son even by curbing and restraining him does not hate him.

# 35.

There is bound to be some ruthlessness in him who curbs or slays those worthy of it even by standing detached.

# 36.

The lord does not injure others though guilty, otherwise. Of course, he injures the ignorant by adopting neutrality.

# 37.

Hence we shall say that he who inflicts injury ultimately painful is ruthless. Thus a few insist upon this condition. Others do not.

# 38.

Ruthlessness cannot be attributed to the surgeon who operates upon the patient. The inducing factor is kindness alone.

# 39.

Even kindness to violent enemies is not conducive to ultimate good. He who is kind to such persons is ruthless though his ruthlessness is concealed by an illusory kindness.

# 40.

Even neglect and indifference for the opponents who ought to be protected, results in default. He who ought to be protected perishes immediately if neglected despite the capacity of the protector.

# 41.

He who neglects the worthy of being protected.

V&#x26;yaviyasarhhita 1 883

on considering the apparent defaults though he observes his plight is in effect ruthless.

# 42.

Hence it is not generally agreed that kindliness is conducive to good in every respect. What is admitted is the performance of what is befitting. Everything else is unap-proved.

# 43-45.

In reality there are the defects of passion, etc., in the Murtyatmans (Sadagiva, Brahma and others). Still the defects belong to them alone and not to Siva. There may be flaw in the copper put in fire but due to its contact fire does not fade. If impure things are consigned to fire they do not make the fire impure. Some impure things become pure due to their contact with fire. Similarly Siva does not become impure due to the contact with the Atmans that are to be purified.

# 46.

The Atman alone is purified through the contact with Siva. If the iron-rod is put in fire and heated, the burning is that of the fire, not of the iron-rod.

# 47.

The prosperity, glory etc. of the Murtyatmans is really that of lord Siva and not of the Atmans. It is the fire, not the fuel, that blazes upwards.

# 48-50.

The state of being the coal belongs to the wood and not to the fire. Similarly Sivatva is imposed on wood, stone and clay. But the attributes Maitri, etc., are secondary and they act differently. They are conducive to both good and evil to those who are endowed with qualities. What is both secondary and non-secondary is not wholly conducive to good or evil.

# 51.

Learned men do not say that the meaning of Anugraha is secondary. But the liberation from worldly existence is in the form of Ajfia and is beneficent.

# 52.

Carrying out his Ajfia is beneficent. What is beneficent is Blessing. He who employs everything in what is beneficent is the cause of blessing to all.

# 53.

The sense of the word Upakara (benevolence) is also Anughraha. Since that too is of beneficent nature Siva is all-benevolent.

# 54-55.

Everything in the form of sentient and non-sentient is engaged in what is beneficent? But obstructed by

their innate nature all do not get the benefit simultaneously. The sun spreads his rays on all the lotuses impartially. But all the flowers do not bloom simultaneously; they do so in accordance with their innate nature.

56-57. Even the innate nature of the entities is the cause of what is destined to be. The innate nature does not transform that what perishes. The contact with fire melts only gold and not the coal. Siva liberates those whose ignorance is ripe and not the others.

58. What is capable of becoming does not become so by itself without conception. But the maker needs no such conception and is free perpetually.

59. Siva the blesser is innately pure but the Atmans (individual souls) are naturally impure.

60. Otherwise how is it that they invariably undergo worldly existence and do not merge into Siva? Being infested by Karman and Maya is called worldly existence by the learned.

61. There is sufficient cause for this that this infestation is for individual souls and not for Siva. That cause is the personal but not extraneous dirt.

62. Should it be extraneous it may happen to anyone through any cause. But this cause is single due to its nature not being variegated.

63-64. Though the Atman-hood is common some are bound and some liberated. Among those in bondage some have differing degrees of knowledge and eminence due to their being inclined towards abstinence and enjoyment. Some attain the status of identicality with the lord. Some attain the state of nearness.

65. Among those who have attained identicality, some are Sivas. They are stationed on the top of the Adhvas (pathways). Mahesvaras are stationed in the middle; Rudras in the lower region.

66-67. In the vicinity too the three are stationed beyond Maya: the Atman is stationed below; the Antaratman is stationed in the middle and the Paramatman is stationed beyond. They are Brahma, Vi$nu and Mahesvara. Some Vasus too are stationed in the region of Paramatman.



---


# 68.

Some are stationed in the region of Antaratman, some in the region of Atman. In the region of &#x26;antyatita Saivas are stationed and in the Santa region the Mahesvaras are stationed.

# 69.

Just as Raudras are stationed in Vidya and the Vaisnavas in Pratisfha, so also the Atmans. Brahma and Brahma-born are stationed in Nivrtti.

# 70.

The eight groups of Deva-Beings are the chief ones. The human beings constitute the middling. The five Beings birdes etc. constitute the lower ones. Thus there are fourteen Beings.

# 71-72.

The state of being chief or subsidiary shall be known as the dirt of the worldly being. Just as the food we take in has two states, the undigested and the digested, so the dirt too. When it is undigested the men go lower down; when it is digested they go up. Thus the dirt plays its part in the worldly existence.

# 73.

The individual souls are threefold: those with single dirt, with two dirts and with three dirts. Those with single dirt are the higher ones, those with two dirts the middlings and those with three dirts shall be known as the meanest. Thus they are stationed in order.

# 74.

Those with three dirts are presided over by those with two dirts and those in turn are presided over by those with single dirt. Thus is the conditioned difference in the universe.

# 75.

Siva presides over all these, those with single, two and three dirts. Though they are of non-Siva nature they are presided over by Siva.

# 76.

Similarly the universe which is not in the nature of Rudra is presided over by Rudra. The Mahtbhumi, ending with the cosmic Egg, is presided over by Salarudra etc.

# 77.

The atmosphere ending with Maya is pervaded in order by the lords of gods of the size of the thumb all round.

# 78.

The heaven ending with Mahamaya is presided over by the lords of worlds, Vayu, etc., which are stationed within the Adhvas and whose ends are not resorted to.

# 79.

They are the squatters in heaven, atmosphere and earth. They are the gods observing the rites of the gods.

# Sivapurdna

80. Thus functions the ailment of worldly existence with the three dirts and their pathological reasons separately, whether ripe or unripe.

81. The medicine for this ailment is the perfect knowledge of Siva and nothing else. The physician is the lord Siva himself who heals the sufferer.

82. In this regard no doubt need be entertained “Siva can liberate the souls without subjecting them to misery. Why does he then subject them to misery?

83. It is certain that the entire worldly existence is misery itself. How can misery be non-misery? The innate nature cannot be otherwise.

84. A patient does not become non-patient merely because the physician administers medicine. The physician redeems the patient from the sickness through the medicines.

85. Similarly, through the administration of the medicine in the form of his Ajna, Siva liberates the souls from misery —the souls innately dirty and innately miserable.

86. This inequality like the physician is not the cause of the ailment. So Siva is the cause of worldly existence need not be a symbol of defect.

87. When misery is innately acquired how can Siva be its cause? The dirt is inborn in men. It is that which makes them undergo the sufferings of worldly existence.

88. The dirt which is the cause of worldly existence, the insentient Maya, etc., cannot function by itself without the proximity of Siva.

89. The wise say just as the magnetic stone causes the movement of the iron filings by its mere proximity, so also Siva causes the movement of the world.

90. It is not possible to avoid the proximity of Sat without its cause. Moreover the presiding deity Siva is even unknown to the universe.

91. Nothing functions without Siva. Everything is induced by him. Still he is not deluded.

92. His Sakti in the form of Ajna is the all-round restraining factor. This universe is perpetually covered over by it. Still he is not defiled.



---

Vdyaviyasamhitd
1887

93. This is ruled over even from the beginning. He is the lord. His ruling is his Ajfia. Still he is not defiled.

94. He who considers otherwise due to delusion is evil-minded. He perishes and that too due to the power of his Sakti. Still he is not defiled.

95. In the meantime an unembodied voice was heard from the sky. “Satyarn (Truth), Amptam (nectar), Saumyam (gentle), Om Amen. This sound came out clearly.

96. Then the sages were surprised and delighted; their doubts were quelled. They bowed to the lord, the wind-god.

97. Although he had cleared their doubts he thought that their knowledge was not firmly established. So he said: Vayu said: —

98. Knowledge is of two types: indirect and direct. They say that the former is unsteady and the latter is stable.

99. What is acquired by reasoning and instructions is the indirect knowledge. The direct knowledge results from the practice of rites.

100. Coming to the conclusion that salvation is not possible without direct knowledge, strive assiduously for the acquisition of practice.

# CHAPTER THIRTYTWO

# (The description of excellent practice)

The sages said: —

1. What is that excellent practice of holy rites, whereby salvation is directly acquired? O Maruta, it behoves you to explain it as well as its means.

Vayu said:

2. What is termed excellent practice is the great cult of Siva wherein Siva the bestower of salvation is directly perceived.



---


# 3.

It is fivefold divided into five sections, holy rites, penance, japa, meditation and knowledge.

# 4.

The five activities along with attendant virtuous rites constitute the greatest Dharma. Thereby one attains the direct and indirect knowledge that bestows salvation.

# 5.

The two Dharmas the higher and secondary are mentioned in the Vedas. In the matter of Dharma the Vedas constitute the final authority for us.

# 6.

The higher dharma up to the practice of Yoga is mentioned in the Vedantic section of the Vedas. The secondary Dharma is mentioned in the Karmakanda section of the same.

# 7.

The Atmans freed from Pasa are authorised in the higher Dharma and in the other one, every one is authorised.

# 8.

This higher Dharma is the means for achieving the greatest virtue of Siva. It shall be supplemented in all parts by Dhasmasastras and other holy treatises.

# 9.

The greatest Dharma of Siva termed the excellent practice is explained in the Itihasas and the Puranas.

# 10.

In the Saiva Agamas a detailed explanation of everything including the consecratory rites is given.

# 11.

The Saiva agama is of two varieties: Srauta and A^rauta. The Srauta consists of condensed Vedic texts; the other one consists of independent texts but well consecrated.

# 12.

The independent texts were originally ten but supplemented subsequently by eight more so as to constitute eighteen texts. They are called Kamika etc., and the entire literature is called “Saiva Siddhanta.”

# 13.

The Srauta literature consists of a billion verses. In it the Pasupata Vrata and Jnana are explained.

# 14.

In every circle of Yugas, Siva incarnates as Yogacarya in different places and propagates yoga.

# 15.

The four great sages Ruru, Dadhlca, Agastya and the renowned Upamanyu have condensed these principles and propagated them.

# 16.

They are all Pasupatas and exponents of the Samhltas. Hundreds and thousands of their descendants have been the preceptors of their principles.

# 17.

The great virtue of Siva mentioned before is four-

fold with regular performance and observance as the basic, Atman for them. Among them the Pasupata yoga facilitates the direct perception of Siva.

# 18.

Hence the excellent practice is this Pasupata Yoga. The mode of it as practiced by Brahma shall now be mentioned.

# 19.

This is Namastakayoga prescribed by Siva himself. By means of this Yoga the discernment of Siva is generated.

# 20.

Through this discernment the stable and perfect knowledge is attained ere long. Siva is delighted with him whose knowledge is well-founded.

# 21.

Thanks to his grace the great Yoga is attained which facilitates the direct perception of Siva. By perceiving Siva directly the cause of worldly existence is quelled.

# 22.

Then the devotee is liberated from worldly existence and being liberated he becomes identical with Siva. The means mentioned by Brahma is now separately mentioned here.

# 23-24.

Siva, Mahesvara, Rudra, Visnu, Pitamaha, Samsaravaidya, Sarvajria and Paramatman—these eight names mainly indicate Siva. The first five are the names of the deities presiding over the Kalas, Santyatita etc.

# 25-28.

The five names of Sadasiva originate from the conditioning factors. When the conditioning factors cease to exist they too recede. The region is eternal and the Atmans who occupy them are non-eternal. When the Padas are changed the Padins are released. In another evolution they attain the same region. But the first five Atmans undergo the change of names. The last three names are due to the adoption of the three conditioning factors. They indicate only Siva.

# 29-30.

He who is naturally pure is called Siva. He has the antecedent non-existence of the contact of the primordial dirt. Or, he who is full of good attributes and is Isvara is called Siva by good men who propound the Saivite principles.

# 31-35.

The name MaheSvara is explained thus: Prakrti is greater than the twenty-three principles. Purusa the twenty-fifth principle is greater than Prakrti.

230. The twenty-two verses (23-44) of this chapter are the same as the verses 1-22 of Kailasa S. Gh.

231. See P. 1072 note

first Svara in the Vedas. Since his real nature is comprehensible only through the Vedas he is established in the Vedanta. He who is beyond this Purusa, who is associated with Prakrti is Mahesvara because both the Prakrti and Puru?a function in subservience to him. Or, MaheSvara is the wielder of Maya. Maya is Prakrti the principle with the three Gunas. It is unchanging. He who makes this Maya energetic is Mahesvara. He is glorified as Kalatman, Parajnatman, the primordial, the gross and the subtle.

# 36.

The explanation of the word Rudra: ‘Rud’ means misery and ‘Dravayati’ means ‘routs’. Since the lord quells our misery he is called Rudra.232 He is Siva, the great cause.

# 37.

Siva pervades all living beings, the principles and elements. He is wakefully present in the bodies and presides over them. Hence he is called Visnu.

# 38.

Siva is the progenitor of the souls that have attained the status of fathers. He is therefore called the grandfather.

# 39-40.

Siva is called the physician of the universe. Just as the physician who is conversant with the pathology diagnoses and cures the ailment with medicines so also the lord annihilates the worldly existence along with its roots. He is so called by all those who understand the nature of principles.

# 41-43.

Even when they have the sense-organs for comprehending the ten objects of sensual perception, the atoms do not know the beings gross and subtle, present in the three periods of time, in their entirety because they are hidden by the particles of dirt in the form of Maya, whereas Sada£iva has not these causes of perception. Even when they are not present, he knows without any strain every object as it is. Hence, he is Sarvajna (omniscient).

# 44.

Siva is the Atman of all. He perpetually possesses all these qualities. There is no greater Atman than Siva. Siva is Paramatman.

# 45-47.

By the grace of the preceptor the eight names shall be acquired. The knots of the Kala, Nivrtti and others shall be cut off with the five names of Siva and purified by repetitions, strokes and non-restraints. By means of the Su$u-

mp£, the Puryaftaka alone with the chest, neck, palate, middle of the eyebrows and the hole on the top of the head, shall be cut off.

48-49. The Atman shall be taken above to the splendour of Siva beyond the moon stationed in the twelve-petal led lotus of the heart. The mouth is shrunk in size. The body is drenched with the shower of the nectar of the Sakti and merged in their reasons. The Atman is then let down into the heart.

50-52. The devotee then meditates on the great god Siva, favourably disposed to his devotees who is conceived as sitting in the white twelve-petalled lotus beyond the moon, who in the sweet crystal-pure, delighted, cool, lustrous form of Ardhanarisvara, shall be meditated upon. The devotee shall have the mind in normal state. He shall then worship the lord with the eight names of Siva and the sacred flowers.

53. At the end of the worship the devotee shall perform Pranayama and concentrate the mind well. He shall perform the japa of the eight names of Siva.

54-56. He shall perform eight Ahutis in the navel and repeat “Hamah” alope with the Purnahuti, offering eight flowers and conclude worship. With a palmful of water he shall dedicate his Atman. By doing this, ere long, the auspicious knowledge of Pasupata cult is obtained. He acquires its magnificent status and the excellent conduct. Then securing the great Yoga he is liberated. There is no doubt in this.

# 4-9.

There, first of all, on the thirteenth day he shall perform the special worship after taking his bath and performing the daily rites. He shall take the formal permission of the preceptor after bowing to him and honouring him. He shall wear pure white cloths. The sacred thread shall be white. He shall wear a garland of white flowers. White unguent shall be measured over the body. He shall be seated on Darbha grass. He shall hold a handful of Darbha grass, sit facing east or the north. After performing the Pranayama three times he shall meditate on the lord and the goddess. By way of submitting to them he shall perform the Sankalpa saying, “I am performing this Vrata (of Pasupata)”. The time limit for this Vrata is till death, or twelve years or six years, or three years or twelve months, or six months or three months or a month or twelve days or six days or three days or one day.

# 10-11.

He shall arrange the sacrificial fire duly as in the Virajahoma. He shall make the offerings of ghee, sacrificial twigs and caru and perform homa. After the Purnahuti, deserving the purity of the Tattvas, he shall perform the homa with the five-syllabled mantra and the sacrificial twigs.

# 12-15.

In the course of the sacrifice he shall think thus: “Let the Tattvas in my body be purified.” The Tattvas are:—The five elements, the five Tanmatras, the five sense-organs of knowledge, the five organs of activity, the seven Dhatus beginning with the skin, the five vital airs beginning with Prana, mind, intellect, ego, the three Gunas, Prakrti, Purusa, Raga (passion), Vidya, Kala, Niyati, Time, Maya, pure Vidya, Mahesvara, Sadasiva, Sakti and Siva Tattva.

On the morning of the fourteenth day he shall perform everything as mentioned before. On that day he shall observe fast and thus spend the latter part of the day.

On the full moon day also he shall perform similar rites. At the conclusion of the sacrifice the sacred fire shall be extinguished and the ashes gathered assiduously.

Then in the same way he shall dust the body entirely repeating the Pranava Om and ‘Siva'.

# 25

Then repeating the mantra ‘Triyayusam' he shall wear Tripun^ra marks. He shall realise his own Siva-hood and perform ‘Sivayoga'.

# 26

He shall act thus during all the three Sandhyas. This Pa£upata Vrata yields worldly pleasures and salvation dispelling Pasu-hood.

# 7

Freed from Pa£u-hood, the devotee shall worship the phallic image of Siva.

If capacity permits, an eight-petalled Padma shall be made in gold embellished with the nine precious gems. The pericarp and the filaments shall be furnished.

If the capacity does not permit, a red or a white lotus shall be used. If that is not available, an imaginary lotus shall be conceived.

# 30.

In the middle of the pericarp a small crystal phallic image along with its pedestal shall be kept and worshipped.

# 31.

After installing the phallic image in accordance with the rules with due consecrations the pedestal shall be conceived along with the idol of five faces.

# 32.

The ablution shall be performed with golden vessels, filled with Paficagavya 234 collected in accordance with one’s capacity.

# 33-35.

The vessels shall contain scents along with camphor, sandal and saffron and these shall be smeared over the phallic image bedecked in ornaments. He shall worship it with Bilva leaves, red, white and blue lotuses, other fragrant flowers, holy and auspicious leaves, Durva grass of various types, in accordance with their availability and the rules of worship.

# 36.

Showing of lights, incense and the food offerings shall be made to the deity. After offering it to the deity the devotee shall be engaged in auspicious activities.

# 37.

In this Vrata exquisite and pleasing things acquired legitimately, whatever they may be, shall be offered to the deity.

# O 38.

The number of lotuses to be offered is a thousand.
Brahmins, with regard to the other flowers it shall be a hundred and eight for each.

# 39-40.

The leaf of the Bilva tree shall never be excluded. A gold lotus is greater than a thousand lotuses. The case of blue lotuses is also on a par with that of Bilva leaves. With regard to the other flowers there is no restriction. They shall be offered just as they are available.

# 41-43

The Arghya with eight materials of worship as constituents is highly commended. So also the incense and the unguent. To the deity Vamadevasandal paste is recommended. To the Pauruga deity yellow orpiment shall be.

Worship shall be concluded with the waving of lights. The drinking bowl with the complements and bedding shall be offered.

56-57. A moon-like necklace shall be dedicated to the bedding. Everything done or caused to be done shall be royal in its quality, very pleasing and befitting. The contrary worship shall be avoided. After reciting the Vyapohana hymns the Japa of the five-syllabled Mantra shall be performed.

58. After circumambulation and obeisance the devotee shall dedicate himself. Then in front of lord he shall worship two brahmin preceptors.

59-64. After offering Arghya and eight flowers the lord shall be ritualistically dismissed from the phallic idol. After restraining the fire from the fire and ritualistically removing that also, the devotee shall perform the service everyday. Then he shall hand over the phallic idol with the insignia and lotuses to the preceptor. Or he shall install it in the temple of Siva. After worshipping the elders, brahmins, Vrata-performers in particular, he shall propitiate brahmin devotees and if possible poor and helpless people also. If he is competent he shall observe fast or take to a diet of fruits and roots. Or he shall have milk for his diet, or live on alms or take single meal everyday only in the night. He shall be pure in body and mind and lie on the bare ground or ashes or grass. He shall wear deerskin or bark garment and observe celibacy. Thus he shall perform the holy rite.

69-70. Of what avail is much talk? A performer of the rite shall not commit any misdeed. If inadvertently he does commit, he shall consider its seriousness or otherwise and perform adequate expiatory rites in the form of worship, sacrifice, Japas etc. Till the conclusion of the Vrata he shall not repeat the mistake.

71. He shall make charitable gifts of cows and oxen, perform worship in accordance with her wealth and capacity devoutly and free from any specific desire, for the pleasure of Siva.

72. The common features of this Vrata have been narrated briefly. I shall now explain the special features for every month in the manner I have heard.

73-76. In Vai£akha the phallic idol of adamant, in Jye$tha that of an emerald, in A$adha that of pearl, in Sravana that of Sapphire, in Bhadrapada that of ruby, in Alvina that of onyx, in Karttika that of a coral, in Marga£ir$a that of lapis lazuli, in Pau$a that of topaz in Maeha that of the sun-stone; in Phalguna that of the moon-stone and in Caitra that of sun-tone is auspicious. If gems are not available gold shall be substituted in every month.

77. If gold is not available silver, copper, rock or clay shall be used for making the phallic idol whichever is available. Even lac can be used.

78-82. Or he can make the idol as he pleases having all types of flowers. At the conclusion of Vrata after performing the daily rites he shall perform the special worship and sacrifice as before. After worshipping the preceptor and the Vratins in particular he shall take the permission from his instructor. Sitting facing the east or the north on a Darbha seat holding Darbha grass in the hands he shall restrain Prana and Apana. He shall make the Japa of the Mula mantra to the extent of his ability; he shall meditate on Siva and Siva. Taking permission and bowing as before he shall say with palms joined in reverence: “O lord, at your behest, I am concluding this Vrata.” After saying thus he shall cast off the Darbhas at the root of the idol towards the north.

83. Then he shall eschew the staff, the matted hair,



---


the bark garment and the girdle too. After performing Acamana he shall repeat the five-syllabled mantra.

# 84.

He who has resolved to perform this Vrata till death and takes the initiation accordingly and performs the Virata undistrressedly is a Naisthika.

# 85.

He is an Atyasramin, a Mahapasupata, the most excellent of all austere persons and a great Vratin.

# 86.

Among those desirous of salvation there is none like him who is so content. The Naisthika who becomes an ascetic is called the excellent Naisthika.

# 87.

He who performs this rite for twelve days or every day is on a par with the Naisthika, his Vrata being too severe.

# 88.

A person who applies ghee over his body and performs the rite with devout feelings even for two or three days is also a Naisthika.

# 89.

He who performs the excellent Vrata without a desire for the fruit feeling that it is his duty, always dedicating his Arman to Siva has no one equal to him.

# 90.

A scholarly brahmin covered with ashes is immediately liberated from the terrible effects of even the great deadly sins.

# 91.

The great virility of the Rudra fire is what is glorified as the ashes. Hence a person possessing the ashes is a virile and powerful person at all times.

# 92.

A person who has bathed with the ashes is called Bhasmanistha. His faults perish due to the contact of Bhasma fire.

# 93.

He who has smeared his body with the ashes, wears Tripundraka with Bhasma and has a Bhasma bath is Bhasmanistha.

# 94.

Surely the evil spirits, ghosts and goblins and repugnant diseases flee at the very proximity of a Bhasmanistha.

# 95.

It is called Bhasita because it shines; Bhasma because it devours sins; Bhuti because it causes prosperity and Raksa because it protects.

# 96-

What else need be cited to indicate the glory of



---

VdyaviyasamhUa 1899

Bhasma? The Vratin who has had the Bhasma-bath is lord Siva himself.

97. This Bhasma is a great weapon of the devotees of Siva. It is a divine missile whereby the mishaps of the elder brother of Dhaumya in the course of his penance had been removed.

98. Hence one should endeavour in all possible ways to collect Bhasma like wealth after performing the Pasupata vrata and be engaged in Bhasma-bath.

# CHAPTER THIRTYFOUR

# (The penance of Upamanyu)

The sages said:

1. It was for obtaining milk that penance was performed by the boy Upamanyu, the elder brother of Dhaumya. So an ocean of milk was granted to him by lord Siva.

2. How could that infant attain power to propound the sacred doctrine of Siva? How could he realise the existence of Siva and perform the penance?

3. How could he attain the perfect knowledge in the course of his observance of penance? How did he secure the protective ashes, the virile element of the Rudra fire?

Vayu said:

4. It was not an ignorant common infant who performed the penance. He was the son of a great, wise and learned sage Vyaghrapada.

5. He was a great Siddha in his former birth who had fallen from his position for some reason. Fortunately, he was born as the son of a sage.

6. His penance for the sake of obtaining milk became the gateway to the future grace of lord Siva obtained due to good luck.

237. For the similarity of expression and contents of this and the following chapter, see LiAga P. i. 107. The Upamanyu episode of the Linga P- is concise and condensed; that of $P is detailed and comprehensive. The former seems to be the abridged version of the latter.

2‘jtt. LiAga P. omits to mention Vyaghrapada, father of Upamanyu.

# 7.</h7> Siva granted him perpetual bachelorhood, lordship of all the Ganas along with an ocean of milk.
# 8.</h7> The acquisition of Siva’s knowledge is due to Siva’s grace alone. He acquired the knowledge of Sakti even as a boy.
# 9.</h7> His ability to propound the Sivalastra was also derived from the lord. He rejoiced in attaining the ocean of knowledge from the sage.
# 10.</h7> There was an apparent reason for his acquisition of Siva-jfiana. These were his mother’s words full of sorrow for the milk.
# 11-12.</h7> Once the boy had tasted some quantity of milk in the hermitage of his uncle. His uncle’s son had drunk ample milk to his satiety. The jealous Upamanyu affectionately told his mother thus.
Upamanyu said: —

# 13.</h7> O mother, my blessed mother, O saintly woman, please give me sweet cow’s milk. I shall drink it very hot.
# 14.</h7> On hearing the words of her son, the saintly mother, the wife of Vyaghrapada, was very much distressed.
# 15.</h7> With love and affection she embraced the son and fondled him. Considering her poverty she became dejected and lamented.
# 16.</h7> The boy Upamanyu could not forget the milk he wanted. He, the innocent child of great splendour, cried frequently pressing his mother to give him milk.
# 17.</h7> Realising that the boy was tenacious, the saintly brahmin lady thought of a plan to quieten his stubbornness.
# 18-19.</h7> She had gleaned a few grains which the sweet-voiced lady ground into a paste with water. “Come on, dear,” she addressed her son and though she was distressed at heart she gave him the improvised milk.

Vayaviyasam hita
in misery caught hold of him, kissed on his head, wiped his lotus-like eyes with her hand and said:

The mother said:

1. Rivers full of gems whether in heaven or in the nether worlds are never seen by unlucky people and those devoid of devotion to Siva.
2. If Siva is not pleased with them, they do not get those pleasing things viz. kingdom, heaven, salvation or a milk diet.
3. Everything is the result of Siva’s grace and not that of any other lord. Those who are devoted to other lords wander in distress.
4. Whence can we have milk, we who stay in the forest for ever? O dear, where the sources of milk and where we the forest-dwellers?
5. Wanting everything and overwhelmed by poverty I, your unfortunate mother, have given you this improvised milk grinding the fried grains into paste with water.
6. You tasted the boiled milk at your uncle’s. So when you drank this sour stuff you found out on comparison that what I gave you was not milk. When you cry out saying so you make me miserable. Without the grace of Lord Siva you cannot have milk.
7. What is dedicated with devotion at the lotus-like feet of the lord accompanied by Siva and his Ganas is the cause of all riches.
8. The great lord who is the bestower of wealth and befitting benefits to those who desire them, has not been worshipped by us now.
9. Aiming at riches we have not worshipped Siva hitherto. So we are poor. Hence you do not get milk.
10. O son, nothing else is obtained by us except what has been given by us in respect of lord Siva or Vishnu.

Vayu said:

On hearing the words of his mother, true but

expressive of her grief, the boy, though distressed within spoke thus in a mature way.

Upamanyu said: —

34. O mother, do not feel unhappy; if there is Siva and Siva everything good will result. O blessed lady, eschew your grief. O mother, listen now to my words. If there is lord Siva anywhere sooner or later I shall get an ocean of milk.

Vayu said: —

36. On hearing the words of her highly intelligent son the delighted noble mother replied.

The mother said: —

37. O dear, what you have thought of is auspicious. It increases my pleasure. Do not delay. Worship Sada-Siva and the goddess Siva.

38. Definitely there is Siva superior to all, the great cause. The entire universe is created by him. Brahma and others are his servants.

39. If we have any prosperity it is created by his grace. We are only the slaves of the lord. Except Siva, the benefactor of the worlds we do not know anyone else.

40. Eschewing other gods physically, mentally and verbally, worship him alone, with Siva with due devotion.

41. “Namah Sivaya”, this mantra is directly expressive of Siva, the overlord of the gods, the bestower of boons.

12. The seven crores of mantras including the Pranava Om merge into this mantra and come out again.

43. Those Mantras are also beneficent with regard to those who are authorized therein. At the behest of the lord everyone is authorized in this Mantra.

44. Just as Siva, this mantra too is capable of protecting all Atmans base or excellent.

45. This mantra is stronger than any other mantra. Only this and no other mantra is capable of protecting all.



---

Vdyaviyasartihitd 1903
# 46.

Hence eschew all the other Mantras and devote yourself to this five-syllabled mantra. When that is in the mouth nothing is inaccessible here.

# 47.

The excellent Aghora missile affording protection to the devotees of Siva originates from this mantra. Considering this, be devoted to it and not otherwise.

# 48.

This Bhasma produced in the Viraja fire was obtained by me from your father. It is excellent and it averts great mishaps.

# 49.

Accept the Mantra bestowed on you by me. If the Japa of this mantra is performed your protection will be assured.

# 50-51.

Vayu said: The mother directed him thus saying, “May it be auspicious” and allowed him to go. The sage accepted her words with his bent head. Bowing to her he made preparations for performing penance. Then the mother said to him, “May the gods do everything auspicious for you.”

# 52.

Permitted by her he went to the mountain Himavat and performed penance with purity of minds. He took in only wind (no food).

# 53-54.

With eight bricks he built an altar and installed Siva’s phallic image of clay. He invoked the unchanging lord Siva accompanied by the Ganas and Parvati. He worshipped him with the leaves and flowers available in the forest repeating the five-syllabled Mantra with devotion. He performed penance for a long time.

# 55-56.

Assuming the forms of Raksasa certain ghosts of sages cursed formerly by Marici harassed the lonely, lean boy Upamanyu performing penance though he was an excellent brahmin devotee of Siva. Thus they caused obstacles to his penance.

# 57.

Though harassed by them he somehow maintained his penance. He uttered “Namah Sivaya” like one in great distress.

# 58.

At the very hearing of that sound the sages who hindered the penance left off that boy and began to serve him.

59.  O sages, the whole universe including the mobile and immobile beings became ignited due to the penance of that brahmin, the noble Upamanyu.

# CHAPTER THIRTYFIVE

# ( The story of Upamanyu)

Vayu said:

1. Then the excellent gods with their bodies illuminated hastened to Vaikuntha. After bowing they mentioned everything to Vi$nu.
2. On hearing them, lord Visnu thought “What is this?” After understanding the reason he immediately went to the Mandara mountain with a desire to see lord Siva. On seeing the lord and bowing to him with palms joined in reverence he said:

Vi$nu said:

O lord, a certain brahmin well known as Upamanyu has burnt everything by his penance for obtaining the milk.

Vayu said:

On hearing the words of Visnu, lord Siva said: “I shall prevent the boy. You may please go back to your abodes”.
On hearing the words of lord Siva, Visnu the favourite of the gods went to his abode after consoling the gods and others.
In the meantime, the trident-bearing lord Siva resolved to go there assuming the form of Indra.
Taking up the physical form as the king of gods, accompanied by gods, Asuras, Siddhas and serpents, and seated on a white elephant Sadasiva went to the hermitage of the sage.



---


1. The elephant fanned the lord with the chowrie and held the white umbrella with the left hand while bearing the lord of gods accompanied by Sacl.

2. Lord Sadagiva accompanied by assuming the form of Indra, shone with that umbrella like the Mandara mountain with the disc of the moon.

3. Assuming the form of Indra, lord Siva went to the hermitage of Upamanyu in order to bless him.

4. On seeing lord Siva, in the form of Indra, the sage bowed his head and spoke.

Upamanyu said: O

5. O lord of gods, lord of the universe, excellent god, my hermitage is sanctified since you have come here.

Vayu said:

6. Glancing at the brahmin who stood steady after saying thus, with palms joined in reverence, Siva in the guise of Indra spoke majestically.

Indra said: — O

7. O sage of good rites, elder brother of Dhaumya, I am delighted with your penance. Mention the boon you wish to have. I shall grant you whatever you desire.

Vayu said:

8. The leading sage when urged thus by Indra spoke with palms joined in reverence— ‘I request you to grant me the boon of devotion to Siva*.

9-11. On hearing that Indra said:— “you do not know me the lord of gods the overlord of the three worlds, Indra, saluted by the gods. O brahminical sage, be my devotee. Always worship only me. Welfare be to you. I shall give you everything. Abandon Rudra who is devoid of attributes. What purpose of yours can be served by Rudra who without attributes has become a ghost ostracised from the midst of the gods.”

Vayu said:

12. On hearing that, the sage began to repeat the



---


1906 Sivapurdna

five-syllabled Mantra. He thought that Indra had come there to put obstacles in his holy rites and so said. Upamanyu said:

# 21.

You have said all these things in your eagerness to disparage Siva. In that context you have mentioned the Nirgunatva of the great lord.

# 22*

You do not know Rudra the lord of the chiefs of the gods, the progenitor of Brahma, Visnu and Siva and who is greater than Prakrti.

# 23.

I desire to get my boon granted by the lord who is separate from Sat and Asaf, who is the unmanifest, as mentioned by the propounders of Brahman and who is eternal, single and multifarious.

# 24.

I desire to secure the boon from that lord whom the knowers of truth meditate upon, who bestows the goal of Samkhya and Yoga, viz. release.

# 25.

There is no higher truth than Siva who is the cause of all causes, the creator of Brahma, Visnu and other gods and who is the lord beyond attributes.

# 26.

Of what avail is such talk? I infer that in the previous birth I committed a great sin because a disparaging remark about Siva was heard by me.

# 27.

On hearing the censure of Siva, one shall immediately abandon one’s life and slay that person too. He then attains Siva’s region. 239

# 28.

O base god, let my desire for milk wait. After killing you with Siva’s missile I shall abandon this body of mine.

Vdyu said:—

# 29.

After saying this, Upamanyu, ready to die himself eschewed his desire for milk and got ready to kill Indra.

# 30*31.

He took the ash and reinvigorated it with the Aghorastra mantra. Aiming it at Indra he cast it off and

Vdyaviyasamhita 1907

shouted loudly. Remembering the feet of Siva he attempted to burn off his body. Upamanyu held the fiery missile ready for discharge.

32. When the brahmin attempted this, lord Siva disguised as Siva who destroyed the eyes of Bhaga prevented the missile of the Yogin gently.

33. At the behest of the lord, Nandin the favourite of Siva caught in the middle the Aghorastra hurled by him.

34. Assuming his own form with the crescent moon for his crest, Lord Siva revealed himself to the brahmin.

35-36. The Lord showed to him a thousand oceans of milk, nectar curds, ghee, fruits, foodstuffs and a mountain of sweet pies.

37. The lord appeared thus seated on the bull along with the goddess and surrounded by the lords of Ganas and holding the divine missiles, trident etc.

38. The Dundubhi drums were sounded in the heaven. There was a shower of flowers; the ten quarters were filled with the gods, chiefs of whom were Visnu, Brahma and Indra.

39. Then Upamanyu enveloped by the waves of bliss fell at his feet, his mind made humble with devotion.

40. Then the smiling lord Siva called him nearer, kissed him on the head and granted him boons. Siva said:

41. Partake of various foodstuffs as you please along with your kinsmen, for ever. Be happy always, free from misery. Be my devotee.

42. O fortunate Upamanyu, this goddess Parvati is your mother. You have been adopted as my son. The milk ocean is given to you.

43. So also the ocean of honey, of rice with curds and ghee and of fruits etc.

44. O sage, mountains of sweet pies, the ocean of food stuffs, these are given to you. Please take them.

45. Your father is lord Siva. Your mother is Parvati, the mother of the universe. I give you the status of a god; the eternal chieftainship of the Ganas.

Choose boons as you please. I am delighted. I shall grant you boons. You need not hesitate at all.

Vaju said:

47. Saying thus lord Siva caught him with his hands, kissed him on the head and handed him over to the goddess saying, “This is your son.”

48. The goddess received him with pleasure like Guha, placed her hand on his head, granted him the unchanging status of a Bachelor.

49. The milk ocean came in an embodied form holding sweet milk in his hands. Approaching the saintly boy he gave him imperishable condensed milk.

50. The goddess, out of delight, gave him the Yogic prosperity, perpetual contentment, imperishable Brahma-Vidya and the greatest affluence.

51. The delighted Siva saw the splendour of his penance, granted boons again to the sage Upamanyu.

52. He gave him the Pasupata rite, the PaSupata knowledge and the perpetual ability to propound and discourse.

53. Obtaining the divine boons and the perpetual bachelorhood from Siva and Siva he became joyous.

54. Delighted in his mind he bowed with palms joined in reverence. The brahmin then requested lord Siva for a boon and said.

55. “O lord of the chiefs of the gods, be pleased. Please grant me devotion to you, great, divine and unflinching.

56. O great lord, grant me an abiding faith in persons devoted to you. Grant me the great slavery and the perpetual proximity to you.

57. After saying this, Upamanyu the excellent brahmin eulogised the lord in the words choked with delight.

58. O great lord, O lord of gods, favourably disposed to those who seek refuge in you. O ocean of mercy, be pleased always, O Siva, accompanied by Parvati.

Vayu said:

59. Thus requested lord Siva, the granter of boons.

replied with delighted mind to Upamanyu the excellent sage.

Siva said:

1. O dear Upamanyu, I am delighted. Indeed everything has been granted by me to you. O brahminical sage, you are of steady devotion. I wanted to test you.
2. Be free from old age, death and misery. Be glorious and endowed with splendour and divine knowledge.
3. Your kinsmen, your family and spiritual lineage shall be everlasting. O excellent brahmin, your devotion to me shall be permanent.
4. O excellent brahmin, I shall always be present in your hermitage. Near me you shall always blissfully sport about.
5. Thus granting him the boons lord Siva who had the lustre of a crore suns, vanished there itself.
6. Securing the boons from the lord, Upamanyu, delighted in his mind, went to his mother’s abode and attained the supreme bliss.

# Section II

# CHAPTER ONE

# [Acquisition of sons by $rikr$na]

1. Obeisance to the lord whose chest is marked by the saffron from the plump pair of breasts of Gaurl and who causes the entire world whirl like a wheel.

Suta said:

2-4. After narrating how Uparnanyu attained favours from the lord, Vayu got up for the routine observances when the sun reached the middle of the sky. All the sages, the residents of the Naimisa forest, resolved within themselves what topic should be asked. After performing their duties as usual, they saw that the lord Vayu was coming and so sat waiting for him.

5. At the end of the observance of the daily routine lord Vayu occupied his assigned seat in the middle of the assembly of the sages.

6. Vayu, saluted by all the worlds, comfortably seated himself in the seat. Keeping well in his mind the glorious prosperity of the lord, he spoke thus.

7. “I resort to that great lord, the unvanquished and the omniscient whose prosperity and glory constitute the universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings.

8. On hearing the auspicious statement the sages of quelled sins spoke these words in order to hear further the details of the lord’s glory.

*The sages said:

9-11. O lord, you have already mentioned the details of Uparnanyu of noble soul, how he attained various favours from the supreme lord by means of the penance performed for the sake of milk. Formerly, we had heard that this elder

Brother of Dhaumya was met by firjkrsna of unstrained activities, son of Vasudeva. Then Krsna performed the Pasupatavrata and attained perfect knowledge. How did lord Krsna attain the perfect knowledge of Pasupati?

Vdyu said:

12. Vasudeva, the eternal god, had taken his incarnation out of his own free will. Still he performed the purificatory rites for his body thereby indicating that the human body is worthy of censure.

13. He went to the great sage’s hermitage resorted to by other sages, in order to perform a penance for the sake of sons. There he saw the sage Upamanyu.

14-15. The sage had great splendour all over his body being rendered white due to the Bhasma smeared over. His forehead was marked with Tripundras. He was bedecked in rosaries of stringed Rudraksa beads. The clustered malted hair embellished him. He was surrounded by sages who were his disciples, just as the Veda is surrounded by the scriptural texts. He was calm and engaged in meditation on Siva.

16. On seeing him hairs stood on their ends in the body of Krsna due to delight. Respectfully he circumambulated him thrice and knelt before him. With shoulders drooping and palms joined in reverence he delightfully eulogised him.

17. At the mere vision of the sage, all dirt born of Maya and Karman of Krsna was quelled.

18-19. When the dirt of Krsna had been quelled, Upamanyu dusted him with Bhasma repeating the Mantras “Agniriti” 240 etc. He was then made to perform the Pasupata Vrata lasting for twelvemonths. Then the sage imparted to him the excellent knowledge.

20. Since then the divine Pasupata sages of duly completed rites surrounded him.

21. Then at the behest of his preceptor, Krsna of great prowess performed penance for the attainment of a son with Siva and Parvati as the deity aimed at.

22. Due to that penance, at the end of a year, lord

Siva, equipped with great splendour and accompanied by his Ganas and Parvati appeared there.

23. After bowing to Siva of handsome features, who appeared before him for granting boons, Krsna eulogised him with palms joined in reverence.

24. Krsna of composed mind obtained his son Samba of good qualities bequeathed by Siva who was delighted by his penance.

25. Since it was Siva accompanied by Amba, who blessed him with a son, he named Jambavati’s son Samba.

26. Thus I have narrated to you how Krsna of wide activities attained knowledge from the great sage and a son from Siva.

27. He who recites this everyday, listens to it or narrates it to others attains Vi?nu’s wisdom and rejoices with him.

# CHAPTER TWO

# (The glory of lord Siva)

The sages said: How

1. What is the PaSupata knowledge? Is Siva the lord of Pasus? Why was Dhaumya’s elder brother asked by Krsna of unstrained activities.

2. O lord Vayu, of the form of Siva, please explain all these things. In the whole of the three worlds there is no other person competent to explain it like you.

Suta said:

3. On hearing the words of the sages, Vayu thought upon Siva, and began to explain.

Vayu said:

4. This excellent and exalted PaSupata knowledge was mentioned to the goddess by lord Siva on the mountain Mandara.

V&#x26;yaviyasarhhitit 1913

5. The same question was asked by Kf?na, the cause of the universe about the animal nature of the gods and others and the overlordship of Siva.

6. I shall explain it succinctly as imparted to K??na by Upamanyu. Please hear attentively.

7. Formerly Visnu in the form of Kr§na bowed to Upamanyu sitting in his hermitage and spoke courteously. Lord Kr$na said:

8. O lord, I wish to hear about the divine Pa£upata knowledge as mentioned to the goddess by the lord. I wish to hear about his prosperity and glory entirely.

9. How is the lord known as Pa£upati, lord of Pa£us? Who are the Palus? What are those Pa£as (strings) with which they are bound? How are they released?

10. Thus implored by the noble Krsna the glorious Upamanyu bowed to the lord and the goddess and spoke as follows. Upamanyu said:

11. Every being beginning with Brahma and ending with immobile beings is called Pa£u in relation to the lord of gods. Every being is subject to worldly existence.

12. Siva, lord of the gods, is known as Pa£upati in view of his being the lord of the Pa£us. The Pati binds the Pasus through the Pasas (strings) of dirt.

13-14. He alone releases when he is meditated upon and worshipped with devotion. The twenty-four principles, Maya, Karman and the three Gunas are called Visayas. These are the Pa£as that bind the Pa§us. After binding the Pasus, from Brahma to the grass, by means of these Pa£as, lord Siva makes them do their respective duties.

15-20. At his behest Prakrti generates Buddhi befitting the Puru§a. Buddhi (cosmic intellect) generates Ahankara (Ego). The ego generates the eleven sense-organs and five Tanmatras. At his bidding the Tanmatras too, create the great Bhutas entirely in their order; the great Bhutas create the physical bodies of all beings from Brahma to the grass. Intellect determines and resolves. Ego feels pride in and

identifies with what is possessed. Consciousness observes and becomes conscious of things. Mind conceives and imagines. The organs of knowledge apprehend the objects separately.

21-22. The sense-organs grasp their objects and not others and this is due to the divine command of the lord. The organs of activity too do their own duties. Nothing else. It is due to Siva’s order that sound, etc. are grasped, speech, etc. are made. Siva’s weighty command is not to be transgressed by any.

23-26. It is only at the behest of the lord that ether pervades all, yields space to the elements. At the bidding of Jiva the wind sustains the entire universe, internal and external, under different names of Prana, etc. At the bidding of the lord the firegod bears offerings to the gods and oblations to the Pitrs. It facilitates cooking etc. At his behest the waters enliven all. At the bidding of the lord the earth holds up the universe for ever.

27-30. In respect of Siva’s inviolable command lord Indra protects the gods, kills the Asuras and guards the worlds. By Siva’s command lord Varuna rules over the waters and binds those who are to be punished, by means of his noose. At the behest of Siva the lord of wealth, the lord of the Yaksas, distributes wealth to the living beings in accordance with their merit. At the bidding of Siva, Isana bestows knowledge on the intelligent ones and affords them riches, and curbs the evil-doers.

31-34. It is at the direction of Siva that the earth is supported by Sesa. The Raudri and TamasI form of Visnu that brings about destruction is created by the four-faced lord. At his behest, through other forms of his own, he protects the universe and annihilates it in the end. He protects, creates and devours the universe through his own three bodies. At his bidding alone Rudra annihilates the universe in the end.

35-37. The Atman of the universe thus assuming three different forms creates and protects too- Time creates, protects and destroys at his behest. At his bidding with the three parts of his splendour, the sun supports the universe, commands the shower and rains in the heaven. At the behest of

the moon-crested lord, the moon nourishes the plants, delights the living beings and 'is imbibed by the gods.

38-43. Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Asvins, Maruts, heaven-walkers, Sages, Siddhas, Serpents, human beings, beasts, animals, birds, worms, immobile beings, rivers, oceans, mountains, forests, lakes, Vedas with their ancillaries, the scriptures, the compendiums of mantras, sacrifices, etc., the worlds beginning with Kalagni and ending with Siva and their overlords, the innumerable Brahmandas, their coverings, the past, present and future, the quarters, interstices, the different units of time, Kala etc. — all these, whatever is seen or heard in the world, are presided over by the order of Siva.

44. It is through the power of his order that the earth, the mountains, clouds, oceans, luminary bodies, Indra and other gods, the mobile and immobile beings sentient or non-sentient are sustained.

45. O Krsna, listen to the wonderful feat performed by the order of Siva of unmeasured activity and heard by me from the Upanisads.

46. After conquering the Asuras in the war formerly, the gods including Indra began to argue with one another “I am the victor, I am the victor”.

47. Then lord Siva assumed the guise of a Yaksa and stood in their midst devoid of his characteristic features in the limbs.

48. He set a blade of grass on the ground and told the gods, “He who can deform this grass is the conqueror of the Daityas.”

49. On hearing the words of the Yaksa, the thunderbolt-bearing consort of SacI became infuriated. Smiling a little he attempted to take up the grass.

50. When he could not lift it up he hurled his thunderbolt at it in order to cut it.

51. The thunderbolt coming into contact with the grass appeared to clash with a steel and fell aside.

52. Then the guardians of the quarters and the worlds, of great strength exerted themselves and hurled thousands of their weapons at the grass-blade.

53. The great fire blazed, the fieicc wind blew and the



---


lord of the waters swelled as if the hour of dissolution had arrived.

54. Thus everything initiated by the gods strenuously against the grass was a flop. O Kr$na, it was due to the power of that Yak$a alone.

55. Then the infuriated lord of go 4s asked the Yak$a, “Who are you, sir?” Then even as they were watching, the Yak$a vanished.

56. In the meantime the goddess Haimavati bedecked in divine ornaments, appeared in the sky smiling and shining brilliantly.

57. On seeing her the wonderstruck gods, Indra and others bowed to her humbly and asked, “Who is this uncommon Yaksa?”

58. The goddess smiled and said— “He is invisible to you. He is the lord by whom this wheel of the world including the mobile and immobile beings, revolves.

59. In the beginning the universe is created by him, and it is annihilated again by him. There is none to control him. Everything is controlled by him.”

60. After saying this the great goddess vanished there itself. The surprised gods bowed to her and went to heaven.

# CHAPTER THREE

# ( Upamanyus advice to lord Kr$na )

Upamanyu said:

1. O Kf§na, listen; this universe of the mobile and immobile beings is pervaded by the Murtyatmans of lord Siva, the great Atman. over these by means of his own

2. Siva presides all Murtis. His Atman is incomprehensible. This is said by the sages.

3. These shall be known as his Murtis whereby this universe is pervaded viz: — Brahma, Vi$nu, Rudra, MaheSana and Sada£iva.



---


# 4.

There are other bodies as well, called Paficabrahmans. There is nothing which is not pervaded by those bodies.

# 5.

The famous Paftcabrahmans, the bodies of the lord are I Sana, Purusa, Aghora, Vamadeva and Sadyojata.

# 6.

His greatest first Murti, liana, presides over the individual soul the enjoyer of Prakfti.

# 7.

The Murti of Siva the lord having embodied forms, named Tatpurusa, presides over the unmanifest which is worthy of being enjoyed and which is in the form of the support of the Gunas.

# 8.

The highly venerable Murti Aghora, of the trident-bearing lord, presides over the principle of cosmic intellect consisting of eight parts of Dharma etc.

# 9.

Persons who know the Agamas call the Murti Vamadeva as the presiding deity of Ego.

# 10.

The intelligent men say that the Murti Sadyojata of Siva of unmeasured splendour is the presiding deity of the mind.

# 11.

Scholars understand that the Murti Isana is the presiding deity of the ear speech, sound and the all-pervasive ether.

# 12.

Experts of the Puranas understand that the Murti Tatpuru$a is the presiding deity of the skin, hand, touch and Vayu.

# 13.

The wise understand that the Murti Aghora is the presiding deity of the eye, leg, colour and fire.

# 14.

The devotees understand that the Murti deva is the presiding deity of the tongue, anus, taste and the waters.

# 15.

They say that the Murti Sadyojata is the presiding deity of the nose, sexual organ, smell and the earth.

# 16.

The five Mflrtis of the lord, the sole causes of prosperity shall be assiduously saluted by men seeking Sreyas.

241. Iiina, Purusa (Tatpurusa), Aghora, Varna and Sadya are the five forms of Siva. In the light of this version, the expression ‘Vftmaiafijfia' in SRS I. 30 shall be emended to ‘Vamassadyab' and translated accordingly.



---


# 17. The universe consists of eight Murtis, of the primordial lord of the gods, wherein lies stretched the universe as the gems and beads in the string.

# 18. These famous eight Murtis are Sarva, Bhava, Rudra, Ugra, Bhima, Pasupati, Isana, and Mahadeva.

# 19. The earth, waters, fire, wind, ether, ksetrajna, the sun and the moon are presided over by the eight Murtis, Sarva, etc, of the lord.

# 20. This is the conclusion of the scripture that the Murti of Sarva, in the form of the earth upholds the universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings.

# 21. The Murti of Bhava the great Atman, in the form of water enlivens the universe.

# 22. The Murti of Rudra having terrible form, is stationed all over the universe internally and externally and it consists of fire.

# 23. The Murti of Ugra in the form of the wind and makes everything throb itself sustains everything.

# 24. The Murti of Bhima is in the form of the ether. It splits the elements. It is all-pervasive and gives space to everything.

# 25. The Murti of Pasupati is the presiding deity of the Atmans, immanent in the souls and splitting the binding cords of the Pasus.

# 26. The Murti of Mahesa named Isana, otherwise called the sun, illuminates the universe and moves about in the firmament.

# 27. The Murti of Mahadeva is the cause of the moon who delights and nourishes the universe with his nectarine rays.

# 28. The eighth Murti of the supreme lord Siva is the Atman. It pervades all the Murtis. Hence the universe has Siva as its Atman.

# 29. Just as the branches are nourished by watering.

24J. The Astainurli concept of Siva finds its parallel in Srs Ch. 2. According to this concept, the eight forms— Sarva, Bhava, Rudra, Ugra, Bhima, Pasupati, Isana and Mahadeva symbolize the five gross material elements, the individual soul (ksetrajna), the principle of heat (sun) and cold (moon) respectively. There are variations in regard to their presiding position entailing puranas.

V&#x26;yaviyasarhhitd 1919

the roots of the tree, so also by the worship of Siva his body, the universe, is nourished.

30. The propitiation of Siva bestows protection, blessing and renders help unto all.

31. As the father is delighted at the pleasure of his sons and grandsons so also Siva is pleased at the pleasure of all.

32. There is no doubt if any embodied soul is curbed it is a displeasing injury committed on the eight-bodied lord.

33. With pious emotions worship Siva who presides over the universe in the form of Astamurli Rudra, the great cause.

# CHAPTER FOUR

# (The exalted magnificence of Court and Siva)

Krfna said O — holy lord, it has been heard how this universe is pervaded by the Murtis of lord Siva, of unmeasured brilliance.

1. Now I wish to know the innate nature of the great lord and the goddess. How is this universe having male and female traits presided over by them?

Upamanyu said:

2. I shall explain succinctly the glorious magnificence and the innate nature of Siva and Siva. It cannot be adequately explained in detail even by Siva.

3. Sakti is Mahadevi herself and Mahadeva is one possessing Sakti. The entire universe of mobile and immobile beings is a fragment of their exalted magnificence.

4. Some objects are in the form of Cit and some in the form of Arit. Each of them is again twofold Suddha and Para; Asuddha and Apara.

243. For the similarity of expression and contents of this chapter see SRS. 3

244. Siva in the half-male and half-female (lardhnnfulsvara) form is the cause of the universe. The concept has its basis in the Purusha-Prakrti doctrine of Samkhya philosophers. For details see Shlniiyakarika of Isvarakrsna.



---


# 6.

The wheel of Cit that undergoes worldly existence along with the wheel of Acit is A£uddha and Apara. The other one is Suddha and Para.

# 7.

Both the Git and Acit whether Para or Apara and the lordship of Siva and Siva are natural.

# 8.

The universe is subject to the control of Siva and Sivas, but Siva and Siva are not subject to the control of the universe. Since the universe is to be ruled over, Siva and Siva are the sovereigns of the universe.

# 9.

Just as Siva so also the goddess. Just as the goddess so also Siva. No difference shall be thought of between the two as between the moon and the moonlight.

# 10.

Just as the moon does not shine without the moonlight so also though existing Siva does not shine without Sakti.

# 11-12.

Just as the sun does not exist without its light nor does the light thereof exist without the sun, so also there is mutual dependence between Sakti and Saktiman. There is no Sakti without Siva and no Siva without Sakti.

# 13-14.

The Sakti is the primordial and solitary one, of the form of Git and depending on Siva, by means of which Siva can bestow worldly pleasures and salvation and which is of the same characteristics as Siva, the great Atman through the diverse befitting attributes of the lord.

# 15.

The solitary and great Sakti of the form of Cit, is of parturient trait. It creates the universe with its manifold ramifications at the will of Siva.

# 16.

It is also called Mulaprakrti, Maya and Triguna. It is threefold. The universe is hurled back by her and pervaded.

# 17.

As one unit, as twofold, in hundreds and thousands Saktis ramify themselves in their function.

# 18.

At the will of Siva, the great Sakti united with Sivatattva manifests from it at the first creation, like the oil from the gingelly seed.

# 19.

Then the Sakti being agitated by the Kriya

243 YV&#x3C;* aave emended the reading ftpft to «T faftCT 3T5T and translated accordingly.

Vdyaviyasartihita 1921

Sakti originating from the Saktiman, the primordial sound originates at the outset of creation.

20. The Bindu comes out of the Nada; from Bindu comes out Sada$iva. From him is born MaheSvara and Suddhavidya originates from MaheSvara.

21. That is the deity of speech, the Sakti of Siva named Vagina; the same in the form of letters becomes manifest as M&#x26;tfka.

22. Then by the infusion of the infinite, Maya creates Kala, Niyati, Kala and Vidya and through Kala, Raga and Puru$a.

From Mfiya again originates the manifest consisting of the three Gu^as. From this Avyakta the three Gu^as become separated.

24-25. The three Gu^as are Sattva, Rajas and Tamas whereby the entire universe is pervaded. From the Gu^as, on being agitated and stirred up, the three deities are born as well as Mahat and other Tattvas in due order. At the behest of Siva innumerable seeds are born. They are presided over by the infinite and other VidyeSas, the Emperors.

26. In accordance with the difference in bodies, Saktis are said to be different. They shall be known as having diverse forms both gross and subtle.

27. The Sakti of Rudra is called Raudri, that of Vi?nu Vaisnavl; that of Brahma Brahmani and that of Indra Aindri.

28. Of what avail is much talk? What is glorified as universe is pervaded by Sakti just as the physical body is pervaded by the immanent soul.

29-30. The entire universe of the mobile and immobile beings is full of Sakti. Kala, the greatest Sakti of the great Atman, is called Para Sakti, and it follows the wish of the lord and creates the mobile and immobile universe.

31. Lord Siva is Saktiman possessing the three Saktis of knowledge, activity and wish. He pervades the universe forever and stays.

32. “This shall be this way.” “This shall not be

1922

# Sivapurdtta

this way.” It is in this form that the wish of the lord permanently restrains activities.

33. Sakti of knowledge is in the form of Buddhi and it determines its effect, instrument, cause and purpose factually.

34. Sakti of activity in the form of conception formulates and evolves the effect—universe, in the manner wished for and in the manner determined.

35. When the threefold Saktis are risen, the Sakti of parturient traits urged by the Parama Sakti gives birth to the universe.

36. Siva is called Saktiman since he is in association with it. This universe born of both Sakti and Saktiman is termed Sakta and Saiva.

37. Just as no boy is born without parents, so also the universe of mobile and immobile beings does not originate without Siva and Siva. The universe has both a male and a female source, hence it is in the nature of male and female.

38. It is the effect of the superhuman power of male and female. It is presided over by a male and a female. Siva is the great Atman and Siva the great Sakti.

39. Sadasiva is Siva and Manonmani is Siva, Mahesvara is known as Siva and Siva as Maya.

40. Purusa is the great god and Prakrti the great goddess. Rudra is the great god himself and Rudrani is his beloved.

41. Visnu is lord Visvesvara and Laksmi his beloved. When Brahma the creator is Siva, Brahman! is the beloved of Brahman.

42. The sun is lord Siva and his light is Siva. Mahendra is Siva and Sac! is Parvati.

43. Firegod is Mahadeva and Svaha Siva. Yama is Siva and Yam! is Siva, the daughter of the mountain.

44. Nirrti is lord I$a. Nairrti is Siva. Varuna is lord Rudra. Varuni is Siva.

45. V'ayu is the moon-crested lord Siva and his wife is Siva, the captivator of Siva’s mind. Sacrifice is the destroyer of sacrifice (=Siva) and Rddhi is Siv|.

All that is worthy of being enquired about is sustained by Siva’s beloved. The enquirer is the universal soul Siva himself with crescent moon for an ornament.

All objects of taste are identical with the goddess and Siva is the taster. All lovable objects are identical with Siva and Siva is the lover.

# 71.

The two who are in the form of all and confer welfare on all shall be worshipped, bowed to and meditated upon always.

# 72.

O Kr$na, the innate nature of the lord and the goddess has been explained to you by me in accordance with my ability but I have not exhausted it.

# 73.

The innate nature of the lord and the goddess is beyond the minds of even great men. How can it be explained?

# 74.

Just as it is present in the intellect and the minds of the devotees who have dedicated their minds to the lord.

VSyavtyasarhhitS

and who do not turn to any one else, so also it is not present in the intellect of others.

# 75.

The excellence and superhuman power that has been explained now is based on Prakfti and is great as well. Those who know esoteric secrets understand the secret of non-Prakrtika excellence.

# 76.

The superhuman excellence of the lord which is non-Prakrtika is that from which words recede along with the mind and the sense-organs.

# 77.

That superhuman power of Parame§thin is the greatest splendour, the greatest goal and the acme of achievement.

# 78

Persons who have conquered their vital breath and the sense-organs endeavour to achieve it in order to seal up the door to the prison in the form of womb.

# 79.

A person who has understood the superhuman excellence of Siva and Siva which is the divine medicine to resuscitate the dead on being bitten by the serpent of worldly existence, is not afraid of anything.

# 80.

The individual soul who understands factually the Para and the Apara excellences goes beyond the Apara Bhuti and enjoys the Para Bhuti (the greatest excellence).

# 81.

O Krsna, thus I have explained to you the innate nature of the great souls, Siva and Siva, though it is a secret because you are a qualified devotee of Siva.

# 82.

It is the injunction of the Vedas that the Vibhuti of the lord and the goddess shall not be imparted to those who are not disciples or who are not devotees or who are not the followers of Siva.

# 83.

O Krsna of great welfare, so you do not tell others about this. Mention it to people, like you, who are deserving.

# 84.

He who imparts this Vibhuti of Siva and Siva to qualified and competent men is liberated from the ocean of worldly existence and attains Sayujya21 of Siva.

Sayujya is the fourth grade of liberation, the other three being Sarupya, Salokya and Sannidhya. Herein the aspirant attains absorption in the divine essence. But SP. recounts another grade also, namely Kaivalya which means the devotee’s total merge or extinction in his godhead. See KRS 1 1. 3 et seq.

85. By reciting this, crores of sins perish. Repeated thrice or four times it quells even more.

86. All displeasing enemies perish. Friends increase. Learning flourishes. Auspicious intellect functions in Truth.

87. He acquires devotion to Siva, Siva, their followers and attendants. He acquires whatever is pleasing and all other things undoubtedly.

88. One should recite this with purity of mind, devotion to Siva and full conviction. If due to powerful previous Karmans the fruition is prevented, he shall repeat it again. There is nothing inaccessible to him.

# CHAPTER FIVE

# (Knowledge of paiupati principle)

Upamanyu said:

1. This universe of the mobile and immobile beings is the cosmic body of the lord of the gods. The Pasus do not know it at all due to the intricacy of the Pasa.

2. O scion of the family of Yadu, not knowing his great, nature, never subject to alteration or doubts, some sages call him many though he is one.

3. About the great lord, without beginning or death, some say he is Aparabrahmarupa, some say he is Parabrahmarupa.

4. According to them Aparabrahmarupa is that aspect when the godhead is identified with the elements, Antahkarana the Indriyas, the Pradhana and the sensual objects. The Parabrahman is the great Brahman in the form of Cit.

5. The godhead is called Brahman because it is immense and it expands. Some say that the l£a is of the form of Vidya and Avidya. Thus there are two forms of lord Brahman, the lord of Brahma.

6. They say that Vidya is Cetana (consciousness) and Avidya is Acetana (insentience). The universe too



---

VSyamyasamhitS
is in the form of Vidya and Avidya as belonging to the lord, the preceptor of the universe.

7. There is no doubt in this that the universe is his form because it is subservient to him. Others know the form of Siva as delusion and Para Vidya.

8. Delusion usually means Ayathabuddhi (not knowing as it is) in regard to the objects. Vidya is opposite to it where the knowledge is in the true form.

9. The great principle is devoid of alteration or doubts. The opposite thing is connoted by the word Asat as explained by those who propound the Vedas.

10. Since he is the lord of the two, Siva is called the lord of the Sat and Asat. Some say that he is in the form of Ksara and Aksara. Others say that he is beyond Ksara and Aksara.

11. The living beings are called Ksara. The Kutasthais called Aksara. Both these are the forms of the lord because they are under his control.

12-13. Beyond the two is Siva the quiescent. Hence he is Ksaraksarapara. Some say that Siva is the great cause, that he is in the form of the universal as well as the individual and the cause of both. The Samasti is unmanifest, they say and the Vyasti is manifest.

14. They are the forms of the lord because they function at his will. Since he is their cause, those who know the meaning of the ‘cause’ say that Siva the great cause is the cause of both the universal and the individual.

15-17. The lord is explained by some as the one who inheres in the form of Jati and Vyakti. That which inheres whole bodies is called Jati. Vyakti is in the form of the separate unit and is the support of Jati. Both are protected by his Ajfia. So the lord is called Jativyaktivapus.

18-21. By some Siva is called Pradfyana-Purusa-Vyakta-Kalatman. Pradhana is Prakrti. Purusa is the individual soul. The twentythree principles constitute the Vyakta (manifest) Prakrti. Kala is the sole cause of the transformation of the effected creation. Siva is the lord, creator, activisor, router, and the cause of evolution and dissolution of all these. He is one, the emperor, the unborn.



---

Hence he is called ‘Pradhana-Puru§a-Vyakta-Kala-Svaru-pavan’. He is the cause, leader, overlord and the creator of all these.

# 22.

By some he is mentioned as the Atman of Virat and Hiranyagarbha. Hiranyagarbha is the cause of the worlds, Brahma etc., Virat is the cosmic form or being.

# 23.

Siva is called as the immanent and the great soul. Others say he is the Atman of Prajfta, Taijasa and ViSva.

# 24.

Others say he is the fourth being Saumya. Others say that he is the measurer, measure and the measured as well as the intellect.

# 25.

Others declare that he is the maker, the action, the effect, the instrument and the cause. Others say that he is the Atman of wakefulness, dream and slumber.

# 26.

Some call him the fourth one or the being beyond the fourth one. Some call him devoid of Gunas or possessing Gunas.

# 27-33.

Some call him having worldly existence; Others having no worldly existence. Still others call him free, not free, terrible, gentle, passionate, passionless, inactive, active, possessed or devoid of sense-organs, stable, not stable, with colour or no colour, visible, invisible, expressible, inexpressible, in the form of word and sound or beyond that, possessed or devoid of thought and knowledge, comprehensible or incomprehensible, great and not great.

# 34.

Thus his innate nature, the true form, is being doubted. The sages are unable to determine the true nature of the lord due to the presence of different ideas and beliefs.

# 35.

On the other hand, only those who have resorted to the lord in all piety know Siva, the great cause, without any strain. 247

# 36.

As long as the individual does not achieve the realization of the primordial lord who has no lord above him and who is the ruler of the worlds, he remains in misery.

247 According to f>P. the concentrated devotion, not the philosophical argumentation or the talented discourses can resolve the perfect knowledge of Siva.

# CHAPTER SIX

# ( The Principle of &#x26;iva)

Upamanyu said:

1. 1-2. Siva has no bondage due to the atoms, effects, Maya, Prakrti, cosmic intellect, ego, mind, sense-organs, Tanmatras or the elements.
2. 3. To Siva of unmeasured brilliance there is no Kala or Kala; no Vidya or Niyati; neither lust nor hatred.
3. 4. He has no keen desire. He has neither happiness nor unhappiness; neither Karmans nor their after-effects; neither pleasure nor misery as a result of those Karmans.
4. 5. He has no connection with the seats of feelings nor with the impressions of actions. He has no contact with enjoyments of pleasures nor with their impressions of the three units of time — past, present, future.
5. 6. He has no cause or maker; he has no beginning no end nor the intervening space. He has no activity or instrument. He has neither Akarya nor Karya.
6. 7. He has neither kinsman nor non-kinsman; he has no one to check or to urge. He has no lord, preceptor or protector. He has no superior or equal.
7. 8. He has neither birth nor death; neither expectation nor disinclination. He is not subject to injunctions or prohibitions; he has neither liberation nor bondage.
8. 9. He never has anything not conducive to welfare or inauspicious. He has everything auspicious since Siva is the great Atman.

10. Presiding over everything by means of his Saklis, he is stationed without dropping his intrinsic nature. Hence he is known as Siva.

11. Since the universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings is presided over by Siva, he is known as omniformed. One who knows him as such, is never deluded.

12. Siva is Rudra. Obeisance to him. He is the great Purusa beyond the Sat. He has golden arms, he is the lord of gold.

13. Isana is the consort of Siva. He is the trident-bearing, and bull-vehicled lord. The sole Rudra is the great Brahman. He is the black and tawny Purusa. He shall be meditated upon in the cavity within the heart as minute as the tip of a hair, with golden hair, and lotus eyes. He is pink and copper-coloured.

15-16. He moves about golden in colour, blue-necked, both gentle and terrible and a mixture of the both, imperishable, deathless and unchangeable. Such is the great lord, the slayer of the god of death. He is liberated from the sentient and non-sentient. He is greater than the great universe.

17. Since the knowledge and supremacy of Siva excels those of others he excels all the lords of the worlds so say the intelligent persons.

18. In the beginning he was the instructor of the scriptural texts to the Brahmans born during the period of re-creation.

19. He is not conditioned by time. He is the lord of all. He is the preceptor of all the preceptors, subject to the influence of Time.

20. His Sakti is pure, natural and all-excelling. His knowledge is unparalleled. His physical body is eternal and built to defy death.

21. His lordship is unrivalled, so also his happiness, undying strength, power of brilliance, virility, forbearance and mercifulness.

22. Since he is full and perfect he has no selfish end to be served by creation etc. The fruit of his activities is only the blessing of others.

# 23.

Pranava is the word expressive of lord Siva. Pranava is the greatest symbol of Siva, Rudra and other words.

# 24.

Undoubtedly the great Siddhi can be acquired by meditation on Pranava that is expressive of Siva and by the performance of its Japa.

# 25.

Hence intelligent men well-versed in the Agamas considering identity between the word and its meaning call the lord as single-syllabled Matras A, U, M and

# 26.

In the Upanisads its are four nada.

# 27.

The letter “A” is the Rgveda; “U” is the Yajurveda; “M” is the Samaveda and the Nada is the Atharvaveda.

# 28.

The letter “A” is the great Bija, Rajas and the creator, the four-faced lord. The letter “U” is Prakrti, the womb, Sattva and the protector Visnu.

# 29.

The letter “M” is Puru§a, the seed, the Tamas and the annihilator Rudra. Nada is the great Purusa, Isa, Siva, devoid of Gunas and activities.

# 30.

Pranava expresses everything through the three Matras in three ways and indicates Sivatman through half a Matra.

# 31.

All this is filled by that Purusa than whom there is nothing else greater; than whom there is nothing smaller nor bigger and who like a tree stands steady and stiff in the heaven.

# CHAPTER SEVEN

# (The principle of Siva)

Upamanju said :

1. His Sakti shall be known as natural and dissimilar to the universe in its characteristics. It is single but appears in many forms like the light of the sun.
2. Endless are the Saktis, viz, wish, knowledge, activity and Maya etc. just like the flames of fire.
3. The Purusas— Sadasiva, Hvaraaud others, VidyeSvara Avidyeivara and others and Prakrti —greater than the greatest were born of this Sakti.
4. There is no doubt that the principles from Mahat to Visesa, the deities Brahma and others and whatever there is as effect are produced by it.
5. That Sakti is all-pervasive and subtle. It has the form of enlightenment and bliss. The moon-bedecked lord is called Saktiman.
6. Siva is the one who shall be known. Siva is intellect, the Vedas, the firmness, stability, fixity and the Sakti of knowledge, wish and activity.
7. Ajfia is the great Brahman. The two Vidyas are Para and Apara, Suddhavidya and Suddhakala since everything is created by Sakti.
8. Maya is Prakrti. Jiva is Vikrti. Whatever there is Sat or Asat is pervaded by Sakti.
9. The goddess enchants and deludes the universe without any strain through Maya. She releases the Jlvas sportively. With her ramified into twenty-seven forms, the lord stands pervading the universe. Hence the process of liberation functions.
10. Formerly some sages desirous of salvation held a discourse on Brahman. Their minds were pestered by doubts. They began to reflect and ponder. “What is the ultimate

240. Siva-Sakti shall be distinguished from the prakrti of the SiAkhya system which conceives Prakrti as twenty-fourth principle. S«ik*i in the present context is identical with Siva the 27th principle (Lihja P. 1. 71) and pervades all the Tattvas including Jiva and I ivara.

# 1933

Whence are we born? Whereby do we live? Where is our final establishment? By whom are we presided over? Whereby do we permanently abide by happiness or other things? By whom was the untransgressable arrangement of the universe made? It is not befitting to take time, nature, destiny, chance as the ultimate reason. Nor can it be the Purusa or any of the living beings or a Yogin greater than these. Time etc. are insentient and cannot function as the ultimate reason. Though the Atman is sentient and experiences happiness and misery, yet it is incapable of yielding. After these reflections, those who meditate can realise the Sakti of the lord, the splitter of the Pasa but hidden by the Gunas. Through this Sakti, when their binding cords are cut, they can see all causes through their divine eyes.

He is incomprehensible and through this Sakti he presides over all causes, including the Time-soul.

Then through his grace, the great Yoga and the path of devotion, they can attain the supreme divine goal. The Vedas declare that only those have permanent peace who see Siva in their hearts along with that Sakti and none of the others.

Never is Saktiman apart from the blissful Sakti due to the identity between Sakti and Saktiman.

In regard to salvation, the sequence of knowledge and activity is not intended because if there is divine grace, salvation is accessible to everyone.

Whether one is a god or an asura, an animal or a bird, a worm or a germ, one is liberated due to his grace.

There is no doubt that a child in the womb, a nascent child, a boy, a young, old or a dying man, a soul in heaven or hell, a fallen or a pious, or a wise man or a fool is immediately released if there is divine grace.

The merciful lord quells different dirts of his devotees though they may be unqualified. He is pleased with their devotion.

Their devotion is due to their grace and the grace is a result of devotion in view of the difference in states. A learned man is not deluded therein.



---


# 28.

This devotion with grace as its antecedent and causing worldly pleasures and salvation cannot be acquired in a single birth.

# 29.

Mahesvara is delighted with enlightened people not attached to worldly pleasures who follow the rules prescribed in Srulis and Smrtis and who achieve Siddhis in the course of several births.

# 30-31.

When the lord of gods is delighted a modicum of devotion is generated in the individual with the consciousness, “My lord exists”. Then he begins to be associated with penance and various Saivite holy rites. After their performance and their frequent practice the devotion becomes greater.

# 32.

As a result of that a greater grace is acquired. As a result of the grace liberation is attained. A liberated soul enjoys bliss.

# 33.

There is no doubt that even a man of limited piety is spared the excruciating pain of being crushed in the machine of the vaginal passage after three births.

# 34.

Service with or without the ancillaries is called devotion. It is threefold due to the three means of mind, speech and body.

# 35.

The meditation on Siva’s form is mental service. Repetition of mantras is verbal service. The rites of worship constitute the physical service.

# 36.

This threefold service is called the holy rite of Siva. It is of five kinds as explained by Siva the great Atman.

# 37-38.

In brief they are penance, holy rites, repetition of mantras, meditation and knowledge. Penance is the rite of Candrayana, etc. What is termed holy rite is the worship of Siva’s phallic image. Japa is the repetition of the names of Siva in three ways. Meditation is pondering over Siva. What is mentioned in the Saivite Agamas as perfect knowledge is meant by the word knowledge here.

# 39.

The Saivite Agama was narrated to Siva by Siva out of mercy for those who have resorted to him. That is the sole means of ultimate welfare.

# 40.

An intelligent man seeking welfare shall avoid too

much adherence to sensual objects and increase devotion towards Siva, the great cause.

# CHAPTER EIGHT

# ( The incarnations of Vydsa )

Lord Krsna said : —

1. O lord, I wish to hear about Siva’s knowledge expounded by Siva in the Vedasara for the salvation of his devotees. It is incomprehensible to non-devotees, the unintelligent and those who do not practise Yoga. It consists of five topics. It is censured by the unwise stupid persons.
2. At places it is opposed to the rites prescribed for the different castes and men in different stages of life. At places it is the same. It has been adopted from the Vedas, their ancillary texts and from the systems of Sariikhya and Yoga.
3. It extends to a hundred crores of verses as narrated by lord Siva. How shall the worship be performed, O lord? Who is authorised in the worship? What are the practices of Jnanayoga etc.? O sage of good rites, it behoves you to narrate all these things in detail.

Upamanyu said : —

I shall succinctly narrate the lore of Siva condensed from the Vedas as narrated by Siva. I shall avoid its praises or condemnations. It is convincing and divine. It can be acquired only by the grace of the preceptor. It is conducive to salvation without any strain. A detailed explanation of the same is impossible.
Formerly, with the desire to create, lord Siva, equipped with the causes of the effects already present, manifested himself from the unmanifest.

The principle of evolution that the effect before its manifestation existed in the invisible form in its cause is the main doctrine of the S-nlhya system. In the present context SP. is influenced by this thought.



---


# 9.

Then the lord, the sage, superior to all, procreated the first of the gods Brahma, the Brahmanaspati.

# 10.

While being born, Brahma saw the lord his father. The lord saw and commanded him.

# 11.

Brahma viewed by Rudra created the universe. He prescribed the rules for different states and stages of life separately.

# 12.

For the sake of sacrifice he created Soma. From Soma was born the heaven, earth, fire, sun, sacrifice, Vishnu and Indra.

# 13.

They and the gods eulogised Rudra with the hymns dedicated to him. The lord stood before the gods with his face beaming with delight.

# 14.

The lord took away their knowledge, sportively. The deluded gods asked him, "Who are you?"

# 15-18.

Lord Rudra said: "I had been the only primeval being, O gods, I am and I shall be. There is none except me or separate from me. I alone satisfy the universe through my splendour. There is none superior to or equal to me. He who knows me is liberated." After saying this the lord vanished there itself. Unable to see him the gods began to eulogise him with Samans. They performed the holy rites of Pasupata as prescribed in the AtharvaSiras Upanisads. They smeared Bhasma all over their bodies.

# 19-25.

In order to please them the lord came there with the Ganas and Uma. The leading gods saw the lord whom the awakened sinless Yogins of restrained breach see within their hearts. To the left of lord Siva they saw the beautiful goddess, the greatest Sakti who followed the wish of the lord. The chiefs of the ganas who had forsaken worldiness and acquired the region of Siva and the Siddhas were also seen. Then the gods eulogised the lord and the goddess with the divine hymns from the Vedas and the Puranas. The delighted bull-bannered lord saw the gods with mercy and spoke sweetly, "I am delighted." Then, bowing to him the gods asked him about this important topic.

# 26.

The gods said: "O lord, how shall they worship you on the earth? What is the path? Who is authorised in the worship?"



---


# 1 937

27. Glancing smilipgly at the goddess, Siva the chief of the gods revealed his terrible form brilliant as the sun.

28. It was equipped with the attributes of lordship. It comprised all splendours. It was surrounded by the Saktis, images, planets and the gods.

29-31. The lord had eight arms and four faces. Half of that form was female. On seeing this wondrous form, Vi$pu and other gods understood the lord as the sun and the goddess as the moon and the remaining parts as elements. They realised the universe of the mobile and immobile beings identical with him. Then they worshipped the lord and made obeisance to him.

32-33. O lord, be pleased to accept our worship. You have the colour of the saffron, the excellent disc and the colourful ornaments of gold. Your eyes resemble the lotus; you hold a lotus and you are the cause of Brahma, Indra and Narayana. The golden vessel is filled with excellent gems and water of brilliant hue. Vermilion and other things, Kusa grass and flowers too are offered.

34. Obeisance to Siva the quiescent, the primordial cause, to Rudra accompanied by the Ganas; obeisance to him in the form of the sun, to Visnu, to Brahma.

35-36. He who worships Siva thus in the solar disc with pure mind, in the morning, midday and at dusk and offers the excellent Arghya, or bows and reads the verses pleasing to the ears does not find anything inaccessible. If he is a devotee he is certainly liberated.

37. Hence for the sake of virtue, wealth, love and salvation, one shall mentally verbally and physically worship Siva in the form of the sun.

38. Then the lord stationed in the disc glanced at the gods, revealed the sacred scripture, the sequel to all the Agamas and vanished.

39. Understanding that the Brahmins, Ksatriyas and the Vaisyas are authorised in the worship, the gods bowed to the lord and went the way they had come.

40. After a pretty long interval the sacred scripture was forgotten. The goddess seated in the lap of her husband asked him about it.



---

1938
41. Urged by her, the inoon-crcstcd lord narrated to her the sacred scripture —the sequel to all Agamas.

42. At the behest of Brahma, it was propagated in the world by me, by my preceptor Agastya and the sage Dadhica.

43. In the revolution of Yugas the trident-bearing lord incarnates himself on the earth and propagates the knowledge for the salvation of his devotees.

44-48. Now listen to the incarnations of Vyasa who were masters of Yoga in the different Kalpas: — Rbhu, Satya, Bhargava, Angiras, the brahmin Savitr, Satatejas, Dharma as Narayana, Svaraksa, the intelligent Aruni, Krtanjaya, Krtafjaya (the second), Bharadvaja, the wise Gautama, sage Vacahsravas, the pious Suksmayani, sage Trnabindu, Krsna, Sakti, Saktcya, Uttara, Jatukarnya, Hari and sage Kr§nadvaipayana.

49-51. These incarnations of Vyasa are up to the end of Dyapara. There are the incarnations as Yogacaryas of Siva and their disciples. In different yugas the lord’s disciples are four. Their disciples and future disciples are in hundreds and thousands. By their endeavour, these are purified by their devotion and are liberated by their carrying out the behests of Siva in the world.

# CHAPTER NINE

# (Siva's incarnations as Yogacaryas)

Sri Krma said:

1. O lord, please enumerate the incarnations of Siva as Yogacarya and his disciples in the different circles of Yugas.

Ujpamanyu said:

2-6. The following twenty-eight are the Yogacaryas in the seventh Manvamara, in the Varaha Kalpa:— Sveta, Sutara, Madana, Suhotra, Kanka, Laugaksi, Mahamaya, Jaiglsavya, Dadhivaha, Rsabha, sage Ugra, Atri, Supalaka, Gautama, sage Vedasiras, Gokarna, Guhavasin, Sikhantjin, Langulin, Maha-

kala, Sulin, Mundisa, Visnu, Somasarman, and Lakuliwara. These are in the order of the Yugas.

Each of these had four disciples of quiet minds. They are from Sveta to Rusya. I shall enumerate them in the proper order.

# 21.

These are the disciples of the lord, the Yogacarya.

# 24.

Their number is hundred and twelve.

# 22.

These had become Siddhas by Pasupata rites. They used to dust their bodies with Bhasma. They knew the principles and meanings of the sacred texts. They were masters of the Vedas and Vedangas.

# 23.

They were engaged in Siva’s hermitage. They were devoted to Siva’s lore. They were free from attachments. Their minds were attached to Siva alone. They could bear the mutually clashing pairs extreme cold, heat etc. They were self-possessed and engaged in the benefit of living beings. They were straightforward.

soft and healthy. They had covered anger and their sense-organs.

25. They had strings of Rudraksa beads for their ornaments. Their foreheads were marked by 'fripun^ras. Some had tufts of matted hair. Some had matted tresses. Some had shaven heads.

26. Mostly their diet was confined to fruits and roots. They regularly practised Pranayama. They were rich in their pride in Siva. They were devoted to meditations upon Siva alone.

27. They had destroyed even the seeds of the poisonous tree of worldly existence. They were ready to proceed to the city of Siva.262

28. He who worships Siva every day after thinking about these and their preceptors attains Sayujya with Siva. No doubt need be entertained in this respect.

# CHAPTER TEN

# (Devotion to Siva)

Sri Krjna said:

1-2. O lord, foremost of all Yogins, leader of the Ganas, O excellent sage, O preceptor having the lustre equal to that of the six-faced deity, O storehouse of knowledge, you have assumed the form of a sage but are really the supreme lord. You have incarnated on the earth for breaking the binding cords of men.

3. There is none else but you, among the gods and Danavas in this universe who knows the true nature of Siva.

4. Hence my mind is not satiated by drinking in the nectarine lore of the lord coming out of your mouth as if from that of the trident-bearing lord himself.

•2;>2. A mythical city ‘&#x26;ivapura’ on the Himalayas particularly on the Kailasa peak is conceived as the abode of Siva.

VSyavtyasarhhitS 1941

5. O holy lord, what was it that the goddess seated in the lap of her husband, the creator of the universe, had asked him?

Upamanyu said: —

6. You have very pertinently put the question O Krsna. I shall explain it precisely to you of auspicious mind. You as the devotee of Siva are the person fit to hear it.

7. Accompanied by the goddess, the lord went to his beautiful garden on the beautiful mountain Mandara abounding in beautiful caves.

8. Then Subhavatl, the beloved friend of the goddess with a smiling face, brought many full-blown flowers of great beauty.

9. Thereupon Siva, the chief of the gods, seated the goddess on his lap and bedecked her with the flowers. He was much pleased with himself.

10-11. The gentle ladies bedecked in glittering ornaments working in the harem and the confidential attendants, the chiefs of Ganas served the goddess and the lord, with chowrics in their hands.

12. Then pleasing discourses ensued for the diversion of the lord and the goddess and for the succour of the devotees who sought refuge in him.

13. Then seeing an opportune moment the goddess asked Siva, the lord of the worlds.

14. How can the lord be brought under control by slow-witted men who are not interested in spiritual principles and who do not have self-control?

Lord Siva said: —

15. I cannot be enticed either by holy rites or penance or Japas or postures or knowledge or by any other means except faith. If men have faith in me I can be brought under.

253. The statement is reminiscent of the *£raddha* doctrine of the Bhakti cult.

1942 StvapurSna
control, be touched, seen, worshipped and spoken to by some means or other.

17-18. Hence faith shall be sought and acquired by him who desires to subject me to his control. Faith supports the duties of the different castes and is generated in him alone who abides by all duties of the castes and stages of life. No one else has faith in me.

19. At my bidding, the duties as derived from the Vedas of the various stages in life were mentioned formerly by Brahma.

20-21. That compendium of duties is called Brahma’s Dharma. It consists of expensive rites, and is attended with great stress and strain. The fruits are not comparatively plentiful. By resorting to this great Dharma it is possible for those persons of different castes who resort to me without seeking the support of others, and who have attained the rare faith, to attain virtue, love, wealth and salvation.

22-24. The duties of various castes and stages of life have been re-organised by me. This is my permanent injunction that only those who have devotion to me are authorised in those duties and not others. Hence those who resort to me along the path directed, become liberated from the binding cords of dirt, Maya, etc. due to my grace. They attain my city 254 whence there is no return. Then they become identical with me and secure bliss.

25-26. Hence, after securing or not securing the duties mentioned by me if my devotee lifts himself up by his efforts, it is an acquisition of what is not acquired superior in qualities crores and crores of times. Hence, one shall practise the duties mentioned by me.

27. noble lady, these are incarnations as carya 256 in all the Manvantaras and thousands of generations.

28. O goddess, the knowledge of generations is inaccessible to those who are not my devotees, who are devoid of.

254. The word ‘pura’ is synonymous with ‘city’ as well as 'body' gio.s or subtle.

255. The Yogftcarya incarnations of 6iva are recounted in the previous chapter.

intellect and who do not practise Yoga. Hence one shall assiduously resort to these.

29. That is a great loss, a great blemish, a delusion, blindness and muteness, if excluded from the path of salvation one shall exert oneself elsewhere.

30. O goddess, my eternal Dharma is fourfold: Jnana, Kriya, Carya and Yoga.

31. Jnana is the knowledge of Pashu, Pasha and Pati. Kriya is the purificatory rite in regard to the six paths under the instructions of the preceptor.

32. Carya is the practical application of the holy rites such as my worship and the duties of the different castes and stages in life as prescribed by me.

33. Yoga is the fixation of the mind in me, along the path indicated by me, restraining other activities.

34. O goddess, disciplining of the mind is far more excellent than many a horse-sacrifice. It is conducive to salvation. It is inaccessible to those who adhere to sensual objects.

35. The Yoga that removes previous sins, belongs only to the unattached who has conquered the group of sense-organs by restraints and observances.

36. Detachment gives birth to knowledge. Knowledge facilitates the functioning of Yoga.

37-41. One conversant with Yoga, though fallen, is surely liberated. The following shall be carefully maintained. Mercy shall be practised along with non-violence. Knowledge shall be acquired. Truth, non-stealing, faith in scriptures and God, self-restraint, teaching, studying, performing sacrifice, presiding over sacrifice, meditation, piety towards God and practice of knowledge. A brahmin who follows all these for the acquisition of the path of knowledge, attains perfect knowledge ere long and secures Yoga top. O beloved, the wise devotee burns the physical body in a trice with the fire of knowledge. Due to my grace, the devotee conversant with Yoga eschews the bondage of the Karmans. Karman is in the nature of both merit and demerit. Both these are hindrances to liberation. The Yogin shall eschew both the merit and demerit.



---


# 42.

One is not subjected to bondage merely by the performance of rites. If the rites are performed with desire for the fruits thereof it results in bondage. Hence one shall abandon the fruits of actions.

# 43.

O beloved, at the outset the devotee shall worship me externally by means of Karmayajfia. Then he shall resort to the path of knowledge. Afterwards he shall practise Yoga.

# 44.

The Yogins who have understood my innate nature by karma-yajfia and who view a clod of earth, a pebble and a gold ingot all alike do not worship me further.

# 45.

A Yogin engaged in the path of knowledge, an excellent sage permanently engaged in Yoga, my devotee enriched by purity of mind, shall attain my Sayujya.

# 46.

Those who have not had sufficient detachment in their minds but have resorted to me are authorised only in Jfiana, Carya and Kriya according to their deserts.

# 47.

My worship shall be known to be two-fold: external and internal. My adorative service is three-fold, differing in view of speech, mind and body.

# 48.

The same adorative service is further explained as fivefold, viz, penance, holy rites, Japa, meditation and knowledge. My external worship performed the view of

# 49.

is in other persons. The same thing known and knowable to one-self alone is the internal worship.

# 50.

The mind that is devoted to me is the true mind and not any mind as it is. The speech that pertains to my name is true speech and not anything else.

# 51.

The body that is marked by the characteristic symbols as prescribed by me such as Tripundras, and that is engaged in rendering service unto me is the true body—not anything else.

# 52.

By Karman my worship shall be understood and not such extraneous rites as sacrifice, etc. Tapas or penance is the withering of physical body for my sake and not the rites Kfcchra, etc.

# 53.

Japa is the repetition of either the five-syllabled mantra or the Pranava or the Rudradhyaya hymn and not the study of the Vedas.

54. Meditation is the pondering over my form and not the trances of the soul. Jnana is the knowledge of my Agamas and not the understanding of other topics.

55. O gentle lady, stability in the Tattvas shall be practised beginning with an external or internal object where the mind feels interested urged by previous impressions.

56. The internal worship is hundred times more excellent than the external one in view of the absence of flaws seen and their intermixture avoided.

57. Purity too is the internal one. External purity is not enough. A man though physically pure is not pure if he is devoid of inner purity.

58. O gentle lady, the adorative service whether external or internal shall be attended with devotion. If devoid of devotion, it is the cause of deceit.

59. I am content and pure. What shall be done unto me by men? Externally or internally only devotion is taken into consideration by me. O

60. That activity the soul of which is devotion, gentle lady, is my eternal Dharma. It shall be performed without yearning for the fruit thereof mentally, verbally and physically. O goddess, resorting me with the view

61. to fruit in is easily feasible since the seeker of the fruit can abandon me in case there is no desired fruit.

62. O pious lady, I am the bestower of fruits in accordance with the extent of devotion even to him who, though seeking fruits, keeps his mind well established in me.

63. Those devotees are dearer to me whose minds are attached to me without reference to fruits but who may later on solicit for favours.

64. Dearer unto me are those who resort to me with abject helplessness, unmindful of fruition or otherwise due to the impressions of previous actions.

65. Verily, they do not acquire any further gain than acquiring me. O goddess, my gain too is nothing else but acquiring them into my fold.

66. Their piety dedicated unto me due to my blessing is compelled to bestow the fruit on them, the fruit being the great beatitude.

67-69. They mention about eight traits for those authorised in Dharma, the noble souls who have dedicated their minds unto me without having recourse to anyone else, those who have favourable disposition to my devotees, who encourage my worship, or offer worship to me themselves or perform all activities of the body for my sake or have interest in listening to my stories, flutter in tones, eyes and limbs, remember me perpetually or surrender to me completely.

70-72. If these eight traits are present even in an outcaste he is equal to a leading brahmin, a sage, a glorious ascetic and a learned scholar. A master of four Vedas is not dearer to me than a Candala devoted to me. Things can be given to and taken from him. He shall be worshipped like me. I am not lost to him nor is he lost to me who offers unto me with devotion, even a leaf, a flower, a fruit or mere water.

# CHAPTER ELEVEN

# (The Saivite knowledge)

Lord Siva said:

1. O goddess, I shall now succinctly mention the duties stipulated on the basis of caste for my authorised devotees, the learned brahmins.
2. Daily bath thrice, rites in the holy fire, worship of the Linga, charitable gifts, pious feelings for the lord, mercifulness everywhere at all times, truthfulness, contentedness, belief in scriptures and God, non-violence to all living beings, bashful modesty, faith, study of scriptures, Yoga, imparting of knowledge to others, commenting on scriptures, celibacy, listening to spiritual topics, austerities, forbearance, purity, wearing of the sacred thread, upper garment and turban.

256. Here, the use of the word ‘Mleccha’ is important. It signifies the proselytizing attempts of the Saivite Acaryas to induce the laity to their fold.

PdyavtyasarhkttA 1947

growing the tuft, not resorting to forbidden things, smearing and dusting with Bhasma, wearing Rudrak§a, O goddess, the worship on festival occasions especially on the fourteenth day, the rite of drinking Brahmakurca every month in accordance with injunctions, O beloved, worship after performing my ablution with the same, avoidance of the Sraddha food offered for the propitiation of the manes and of the rice in all sacred rites, stale rice and rice gruel.

8. The avoidance of wine and even its smell or of Naivedya is applicable to all castes, especially the Brahmins.

9-11. The traits of Yogins are ten viz:— forbearance, quietude, contentment, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, my knowledge, non-attachment to worldly objects, using Bhasma and refraining from too much adherence to all. The Vanaprasthas have all these traits as also the partaking of alms during the day. The Brahmacarins shall not take food during the nights.

12. Teaching, presiding over sacrifices and acceptance of monetary gifts are not prescribed by me for the Ksatriya and the Vaisya class.

— 13-16. The following are the duties and traits of kings: protection of the people of all castes, slaying of the enemies in battle, chastisement of the wicked and hunting of harmful birds and animals, distrusting everyone everywhere but belief in my Yogins, intercourse with women on proper occasions, maintenance of armies, keeping themselves well informed about the activities of the people through spies spread everywhere always, wearing weapons, armour dusted with Bhasma. These are in brief the duties of kings following my instructions. The characteristics of a Vaisya are cattle-breeding, trading and agriculture.

17. The duty of a Sudra is service unto the persons of the other castes, making of parks and resorting to my holy centres.

18. Sexual approach only to one’s own wife duly wed is prescribed for a householder and celibacy for all the other three, viz. Brahmacarins, Vanaprasthas and Sannyasins.

19. The duty prescribed for women is service to their own husbands. Nothing else is an eternal Dharma for them.



---


O good woman, if the husband directs her she can worship me.

20. If a woman engages herself in holy rites thereby prejudicing her service to her husband she goes to hell undoubtedly.

21-25. Now I shall mention the eternal Dharma of widows. Holy rites, charitable gifts, penance, purity, lying on the bare ground, taking food only at night, celibacy, ash-bath, water-bath, quietness, silence, forbearance, self-composure in accordance with injunctions, observance of fasts on the eighth, eleventh and fourteenth days and on the full moon days and worship to me. Thus I have succinctly mentioned the eternal virtues of persons of different stages and castes, of brahmins, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas, ascetics, Brahmacarins, vanaprasthas, householders, Sfidras and women, O gentle lady.

26. O goddess, I shall be meditated upon along with you for ever. The Japa of six syllables shall be performed always. This is the brief compendium of duties as mentioned in the Vedas.

27-30. Those who possess excellent devotion as a result of good impressions in their souls of previous actions, who possess the physical bodies assumed by themselves, who are purified by the essence of my perfect knowledge and who have become holy due to my grace are not effected by sins as the lotus-leaves are not effected by water whether they be attached to it or not. It may not be possible for them to maintain the duties of the different stages in life. They have neither duties to be performed nor evils to be avoided. They have no trance to be practised, no great goal to be attained. They are not subject to do’s and dont’s like me.

31. Just as I have nothing to be achieved since I am perfect, so also they have nothing to be attained because they are contented. It is undoubtedly so.

32. There is no doubt in this that they are fallen from the Rudraloka. They are Rudras who have assumed human forms for the benefit of my devotees.

257. The six syllabled mantra of Siva: Oift Namah Sivaya. Though prescribing rituals, yoga and other activities of the Siva-cult the Purina does not reject the authority of the Vedas.



---

V&#x26;yavtyasamhitd 1949

33. Just as my injunctions make Brahma and others act so also their injunctions make other men act.

34. Their sins are quelled by their very vision in view of their excellence of good piety and in view of their carrying out my behests.

35. Proofs indicating excellent fruits are visible in men who have pious feelings for me. They comprehend things not seen before.

36. Suddenly their bodies may throb and tremble; they may perspire, shed tears; their voice may grow hoarse or cracked; they may have a sensation of great bliss. This may recur again and again.

37. The excellent men can be understood by these never-failing indications severally or collectively or by means of the pious feelings of the low, excellent and the middling types.

38. Just as an iron piece in conjunction with the fire is no mere iron piece so also they are not mere human beings. Thanks to my grace.

39. A learned man shall not treat these Rudras with contempt by considering them ordinary men because they have assumed human forms with hands, feet and the like.

40. Insult offered to them by men of confused intellect quells glory, longevity, family and conduct and may cause their fall into hell.

41-43. All those regions except mine, i.e. those of Brahma, Visnu, Indra, and others who have been uprooted though they may be great souls, are easily to be destroyed like cotton. The prosperity of Buddhi, Prakrti, and Purusa is impure. Hence it shall be eschewed by those who are desirous of the region beyond Gunas. Of what avail is this talk? By whatever means it may be, fixing of the mind in me is the only way to achieve welfare.

Upamanyu said:

44. Thus the brief resume of essential knowledge has been expounded by lord Siva, the great Atman, for the welfare of the worlds.

45. The Vedas, Sastras, Itihasas, Puranas and other

# 1950

# Sivapwri^d

lores are but extensive glosses and commentaries of this succinct account of perfect knowledge.

# 46.

This succinct account contains the six topics, viz., Jnana, Jneya, Anustheya, Adhikara, Sadhana and Sadhya.

# 47-48.

Jnana is the knowledge acquired from the preceptor. Jneya is the Pasa, Pasu and Pati. The Anustheya is the worship of the Linga. It is the devotee who is authorised. Sadhana is Siva’s mantra and Sadhya is the equality with Siva. If one has the knowledge of the epitome of the six topics one has attained omniscience.

# 49.

After worshipping Siva externally at the outset by means of Karmayajfia with devotion and in accordance with one’s affluence, the devotee shall afterwards be engaged in inner sacrifice.

# 50.

If for more virtue one is interested in the inner and not in the external working, the noble soul need not perform the external worship.

# 51.

O Krsna, neither within nor without has he ever any duty, he who is contented with the nectar of knowledge and who has identified his Atman with Siva by means of his devotion.

# 52.

The devotee shall eschew in order the external and internal worships. Through Jnana he shall see the Jneya and then eschew the Jnana also.

# 53.

If the mind is not concentrated on Siva, of what avail is the rite even when performed? If the mind is concentrated, of what avail is the rite duly performed?

# 54.

Hence one shall fix the mind in Siva by some means or other without performing the rites or performing them internally or externally in order.

# 55.

Persons who have fixed their minds in Siva, good men who have stabilised their intellect will have the greatest bliss everywhere both here and hereafter.

# 56.

The Siddhis are achieved by the mantra, ‘Om Namah Sivaya’. Hence the mantra shall be acquired for the acquisition of the great magnificence which has nothing parallel.

# CHAPTER TWELVE

# (The glory of the five-syllabled mantra of Siva)

Lord Krsna said :

1. O omniscient excellent sage, ocean of all knowledge, I wish to hear precisely about the glory of the five-syllabled mantra.

Upamanyu said :

2. It is impossible to explain in detail the glory of the five-syllabled mantra even in hundreds of crores of years. Hence hear it in brief.

3-5. The six-syllabled mantra is found in the Veda and Sivagama. It facilitates the understanding of all topics by the devotees of Siva. It consists of very few syllables but is pregnant with meaning. It is the essence of the Vedas. It is conducive to salvation. This expression of auspicious nature is devoid of doubts. It is achieved by the order of Siva. It is attended by many Siddhis. It is divine and delightful to the mind. That expression ‘lord Siva’ is majestic and decisive in meaning. “Om

6. The omniscient lord Siva mentioned the mantra, Namah Sivaya” for the acquisition of all topics and meanings by the embodied beings since it can be easily uttered through the mouth.

7. The first mantra consisting of six syllables is the seed of all lores. It is very subtle but serves a great purpose. It shall be known like the seed of the banyan tree.

8. The omniscient lord, the creator of everything, the all-pervasive Siva who is beyond the three attributes, is stationed in the single-syllabled mantra Om.

9-10. The five subtle Brahmans are stationed in the mantra “Namah Sivaya” occupying one syllable each. Thus in the six-syllabled subtle mantra, Siva in the form of Panca Brahmans is stationed in the way of Expressed and Expressive. Innately Siva is ‘Expressed’ and the mantra is ‘Expressive’ due to its comprehensibility.

259. See Vayu II. 3. 5.: SRS i. 36.



---


# 1952

# Sivapurina

# 11.

This state of being the expressive and the expressed is beginningless inasmuch as this terrible ocean of worldly existence functions without a beginning.

# 12-16.

Siva too is beginningless and he is the releaser of persons from the worldly existence. Just as the medicine is naturally antagonistic to ailments so also Siva is antagonistic to the ills of worldly existence. If the lord of the universe had not been in existence, the whole universe would have been gloomy, since the Prakrti is insentient and the Purusa is ignorant. Pradhana, the atom etc. are insentient. They never function as the makers themselves without an intelligent cause. The instruction in virtue and evil, the bondage and salvation, the activity of reflection — in view of all these things the first creation of men would not have been possible without the omniscient lord. Just as the patients will be devoid of joy and be distressed without the physician so also the people would be in distress without the lord.

# 17.

Hence, surely there is the lord, the primordial omniscient, perfect, Sadasiva, the protector of persons from the ocean of worldly existence.

# 18.

Siva is devoid of beginning, middle and end. He is the lord innately pure, omniscient and perfect as mentioned in Saivite Agamas.

# 19.

This mantra expresses him. He is the person expressed by the great Mantra.

# 20.

The Sivajnana, is as extensive as the expression of Siva, the six-syllabled mantra, ‘Om Namah Sivaya’.

# 21-23.

This mantra is a positive statement and not a parable. How can Siva, who is all-perfect, all-pervasive, innately pure and who blesses the worlds, mention a false theory? As things stand by nature along with their virtues and flaws, and the fruits they are capable of producing, how can the omniscient being mention untruth? Only one influenced by passion, ignorance and other flaws will speak untruth.

# 24.

Those two faults are not present in the lord. How can he then make a wrong statement? Surely therefore the expression that is uttered by Siva, the omniscient without any flaw, is authoritative.



---

Vdyavfyasarhhitd
# 1953

25. Hence, the statements of lord Siva shall be faithfully considered by a learned man. In regard to merits and sins as they are, a person having no faith in him falls.

26. The good statements uttered by the sages quiet and calm for the achievement of heaven and salvation shall be considered ‘sacred utterances.’

27. The utterances that are actuated by passion, hatred, falsehood, anger, lust and greediness are bad. They cause one’s fall into hell.

28. Of what avail is that statement of ignorance and lust which is the cause of worldly pain even if it be polished, soft and charming?

29. Even that ugly statement which on being heard brings in welfare and the destruction of lust etc., should be considered auspicious.

30. Although there are many mantras, there is nothing like the holy mantra uttered by Siva.

31. The Vedas and Sastras along with their ancillaries are present in the six syllables. Hence there is no other mantra equal to this.

32. Just as an aphorism is ramified and expanded by its gloss, the six-syllabled mantra is expanded by seven crores of great and subsidiary mantras.

33. Whatever texts there are, the texts expounding Siva’s knowledge, the repositories of lore, they are the commentaries of the succinct aphorism, the six-syllabled mantra.

34. Of what avail are many mantras and Sastras full of details to one whose heart is firmly established in the mantra “Om Namah Sivaya?”

35. If anyone has stabilised the Mantra “Om Namah Sivaya” by frequent practice, he has learnt all, heard all and performed all.

36. Life is fruitful indeed, of the person, at the tip of whose tongue is present the sec of three syllables ‘Sivaya’ prefixed with the word denoting obeisance.

37. A person steady in the Japa of the five-syllabled mantra is released from the cage of sins whether he be a Sudra, base-born, fool or a learned man.

# CHAPTER THIRTEEN

# (The greatness of the five-syllabled Mantra)

The goddess said:

1. O great lord, how are your devotees liberated in the defiled period of Kali, invincible and untransgressable when the world is enveloped by the darkness of sin, when people are averse to the practice of holy rites, when the legitimate activities of different castes and stages in life have declined, when great danger is imminent, when the question of the rights of the people is involved in doubts, when deviation from duty is certain, when the continuity of spiritual instructions is broken and when the order of preceptors and disciples has disappeared?

Lord £iva said:

Men of the Kali age are liberated when their souls are purified by devotion after resorting to my pleasing Mantra of five syllables.
My five-syllabled Mantra affords protection from the fear of worldly existence to those whose minds are inclined towards me although they may be of distorted outlook, greedy, deceitful, ruthless, ungrateful and defiled by unimaginable and inexpressible faults, mental, verbal and physical.
O goddess, often I have promised that in this world even a fallen man may become liberated through this Mantra if he happens to be my devotee.

The goddess said:

If a fallen man does not deserve holy rites in any respect, the rites performed by him are conducive to hell.



---

Vdyaviyasarhhitd 1955

Then how can the fallen man be liberated through this Mantra?

Lord Siva said:

# 9.

O good woman, what you have said is true. Now listen to what has been a great guarded secret hitherto.

# 10.

Yes, surely, if the fallen man, under delusion, were to worship me with other mantras, excluding the five-syllabled one, he is sure to fall into hell.

# 11.

Persons who live on water or air and those whose bodies are emaciated due to holy rites do not attain my region through those holy rites.

# 12.

But he who worships me even once with devotion repeating the five-syllabled mantra, attains my region through the weightiness of this Mantra alone.

# 13.

Hence, penances, sacrifices, observances and holy rites are not equal to even a croreth part of the worship with the five-syllabled mantra.

# 14.

Indeed he who worships me with the five-syllabled mantra becomes liberated if he is in bondage.

# 15.

He who worships me even once with the five-syllabled mantra with or without the Rudra mantra is liberated even if he is a fallen or a foolish man.

# 16.

O goddess, he who worships me with the six-syllabled or with the five-syllabled mantra, with the Vedic mantra as its ancillary, with devotion to me, is liberated.

# 17-18.

A fallen man or one not fallen can worship with this mantra. My devotee who has conquered anger may or may not be one who has attained me. One who has attained me is a billion times superior to one who has not attained. Hence one should try to attain me by worshipping me with this mantra.

# 19.

He who worships me with this Mantra, being equipped with friendship and other attributes with devotion and celibacy attains similarity to me.

# 20.

Of what avail is much talk? The devotees are authorised in my five-syllabled mantra which is the most excellent one.

# 21.

It is the efficacy of the five-syllabled mantra where-



---


# 22.

At the advent of dissolution when the mobile and immobile beings perish, everything becomes merged in its cause.

# 23.

O goddess, I am the only one staying then. There is no second one anywhere. Then all the Vedas, scriptures etc. are stationed in the five-syllabled mantra.

# 24.

Protected by my Sakti they do not perish. The creation is evolved out of me differently through the Prakpti and the Atman.

# 25-27.

Then comes a subsidiary dissolution of the forms and attributes. Then lord Narayana assumes the physical body of Maya and lies on the serpent couch in the midst of the water. The five-faced lord Brahma born of his umbilical lotus becomes desirous of creating the three worlds. But having none to assist him he becomes incapable. Hence he creates at the outset the ten sages of unmeasured splendour, his mental sons.

# 28.

In order to enhance their achievement Brahma said to me ‘O great lord, please bestow the power on my sons.’

# 29.

Thus requested by him, I who had assumed five faces, mentioned the five syllables, to the lotus-born one.

# 30.

Accepting them with his five faces, the grandfather of the worlds understood me as the great lord, the expressive of great meaning.

# 31.

After understanding the process of its application in accordance with the rules, the patriarch who achieved the Mantra imparted it along with its meaning to his sons in the exact manner.

# 32-34.

After securing the excellent Mantra from him, they desired to propitiate me along the way indicated by him. There is a mountain Mujavat on the beautiful peak of Meru. It is my favourite resort, ever glorious and always guarded by my devotees. Eager to create the world they performed penance there for a thousand years according to the calculation of the gods, taking in only air.

260. It is a peak of mount Meru, well known for Soma production; it is also mentioned in the RV.

# 1957

# 35-36.

On seeing their devotion I appeared before them immediately and explained to them all the details, viz., the sage, metre, KUaka, BijaSakti, deity, Nyasa, the six ancillaries, the limits of the quarters and their application. The aim was to multiply creation through the sages.

# 37.

Thenceforth as a result of the efficacy of the mantra, the sages reinforced by austerities are performing the creation of the gods, asuras and human beings in a splendid way.

# 38.

Now I mention the form of this great mantra. The word ‘Namah’ shall be uttered at first. It shall be followed by the word ‘Sivaya’.

# 39.

This five-syllabled lore is present in all Upanisads. It is eternal as well as the seed of all living beings.

# 40-42.

It is the goddess, my own expression coming out of my mouth at first. The goddess having the splendour of molten gold, plump, lifted-up breasts, four arms, three eyes, and the crescent moon as the crest-jewel. Her hands are as tender as lotuses. She is gentle with the gestures of boon and protection; she is possessed of all characteristics. She is bedecked in ornaments. She is seated on a white lotus. Her tresses are blue and curly.

# 43.

She has five colours with beaming discs, viz., yellow, black, smoky, golden and red.

# 44-15.

If they are separately worshipped, they shall be adorned with Bindu and Nada. Bindu is in the form of the semicircular moon. Nada is in the form of the flame of the lamp. O excellent-faced lady, the Bija of this Mantra is ranked as the second among the well-known Bijas. The Bija of the fourth begins with a long vowel. The fifth one is mentioned as Sakti.

# 46.

O good-faced lady, the sage of this mantra is Vamadeva; the metre is Pankti; the deity, I am myself.

# 47.

The several individual sages of the letters are, O good lady, Gautama, Atri, Visvamitra, Angiras and Bharadvaja.

# 48.

The metres severally are Gayatrl, Anushtubh, Tristup, Brhati and Virat. The deities severally are Indra, Rudra, Visnu, Brahma and Skanda.

49. As their places, my faces beginning with the one in the east and ending with the one above are taken. They are identified with the letters &#x3C;cNa” etc. in order.

50. The first, second and the fourth letters are Udatta. The fifth is Svarita and the third is Anudatta.

51. This mantra is otherwise called Mulavidya, Sivam, Saivasutra, and five-syllabled. This Saiva mantra is my great heart.

52-53. The letter "Na” is the head; “Mafc” the tuft; “Si” the armour; “Va” the eye; "Ya” the missile. At the end of each letter shall be uttered—Namah, Svaha, Va$at, Hum, Vau?at, Phat.

54. There too, the same is the Mulamantra with a slight difference. The fifth Varna is bedecked by the twelfth vowel (‘h’).

55. The devotee shall worship me with Japa, Homa, etc., mentally, verbally and physically through this Mantra.

56. Let it be in accordance with their intellect, injunction in the scripture, time, inclination, capacity, wealth and their taste.

57. O Goddess, my worship will lead to salvation whenever, wherever and by whomsover it may be done if it is with devotion. O good woman, whatever done unto me by one

58. is whose mind is attached to me, whether in the proper order or in the reverse order, is dear and is auspicious to me.

59. I have made certain rules governing my devotees who are not unduly helpless in regard to all sacred scriptures.

60. There at the outset, I shall explain the procedure of practising the mantra without which the Japa is futile and with which it is fruitful.

# CHAPTER FOURTEEN

# ( The glory of the five-syllabled Mantra)

Lord Siva said:

1. O good-faced lady, a Japa without the behest of the preceptor, holy rites, faith and the prescribed fees is fruitless though the behest might have been secured.
2. If a mantra is well practised with the acquisition of behest, attended with holy rites, equipped with faith in me and accompanied by fee it is greatly efficacious.
3. The devotee shall approach the brahmin preceptor who knows the principles, performs Japa, is devoted to meditation and endowed with virtues. He shall strenuously propitiate him mentally, verbally, physically and monetarily. He shall possess the purity of piety.
4. A brahmin devotee shall worship the preceptor always strenuously. If he is affluent he shall present devoutly to his preceptor excellent horses, elephants, chariots, ornaments, garments, grain and riches.
5. He shall not be stringent about money if he desires to achieve Siddhi for himself. Dedicating himself thereafter along with his possessions to the preceptor and after undeceitfully worshipping him to his capacity, he shall learn the mantra and derive knowledge in due order.
6. When the preceptor is satisfied he shall let him stay for a year serving him without arrogance. On an auspicious day thereafter he shall make him take his bath after observing fast. For the sake of purity he shall again be subjected to ablution with vessels full of ghee and sacred water wherein holy materials shall be put. He shall dress him well and bedeck him with fragrant garlands, ornaments and garments. The Punyaha mantras shall be recited and brahmins worshipped. Then in a holy spot, near the seashore, river bank, cowpen temple or in the house itself, at an auspicious hour when the day is conducive to achievement, when the conjunctions of stars are devoid of defects, he shall bless him and impart to him my knowledge duly.
7. In a secluded spot the preceptor delighted in



---


1960 Sivapur&#x26;na

mind shall repeat the mantra with due accents. He shall then make the disciple repeat it. Then the preceptor shall say ‘Let there be welfare. Let there be auspiciousness around. Let everything be pleasing and auspicious’. Thus the preceptor shall impart the mantra and allow him to practise it.

# 16.

Getting thus the mantra and the permission from the preceptor the disciple shall perform the Samkalpa with pure mind and repeat the mantra with the rite of initiation.

# 17.

As long as he lives he shall repeat the mantra one thousand and eight times everyday without thinking of anything else and devotedly attached to it alone. He attains the greatest goal.

# 18.

He who completes the Japa four hundred thousand times with great devotion, taking food only in the nights with full self-control, is said to be a Paurascaranika.

# 19.

There is none equal to him in the world who, after the Purascarana is over, continues to perform the Japa everyday. He is Siddha himself and confers Siddhi on others too.

# 20-23.

He shall take bath, sit in a pleasing posture in a sacred spot. He shall meditate on ine in his heart along with you and shall remember his preceptor. He shall sit facing the north or the east, observe silence and concentration of the mind, purify the five principles by means of Dahana and Plavana rituals. He shall perform the Mantranyasa, make his body worthy and pure, meditate on us restraining Prana and Apana. He shall remember the respective place, form, sage, metre, the presiding deity, Bija, Sakti and the statement. Then he shall perform the Japa of the five-syllab- led mantra.

# 24.

Experts in the meanings of Agama texts say that the mental Japa is excellent, the Upamsu Japa (in a low voice) is the middling. The verbal Japa is of the lowest quality.

# 25.

The Japa with Rudra as the presiding deity is the most excellent, that with Visnu as the presiding deity is the middling and that with Brahma as the presiding deity is of the lowest quality.

VSyavtyasarhhitd 1961

# 26.

The muttering of the mantra with high, low or middle accentuation, the words and the letters being clear or otherwise, is called the verbal japa.

# 27.

UpamSu Japa is the one where the tongue throbs and there is slight utterance. It may not be heard by others or may be slightly heard.

# 28.

Mental Japa is that where the series of letters are thought well and the words and their meanings are pondered over.

# 29.

If the efficacy of the Vacikajapa is one, that of the UpamSu Japa is hundred; that of the Manasajapa is a thousand; that of the Sagarbha Japa is hundred times more.

# 30.

The Japa performed with the pranayama is Sagarbha Japa. In the first and the last even AgarMia Pranayama is commended.

# 31.

After performing the Pranayama forty times, the intelligent devotee, knowing the meaning of the mantra, shall remember the mantra. If he is unable to repeat so many times he shall repeat as many times as his physical strength permits him.

# 32.

He shall perform five, three or one Pranayama whether Agarbha or Sagarbha. The Sagarbha Pranayama is better of the two.

# 33.

The Sadhyana Japa is a thousand times better than the Sagarbha Japa. One of the five types of Japas shall be performed upto the extent of one’s ability.

# 34-36.

There are various ways of counting the number of times the mantra has been repeated. Counting with the fingers is one mode. Eight times that number can be calculated by lines, ten times by dolls, hundred times by shells or gems, thousand times by corals, ten thousand times by crystal pieces, hundred thousand times by pearls, million times by seeds of lotuses, a crore of times by gold pieces, infinite time by a bundle of Kusa grass or Rudraksa beads.

# 37-38.

Rosary containing thirty beads of Rudraksa for Japa bestows wealth, containing twenty-seven beads yields nourishment, containing twenty-five beads bestows salvation, containing fifteen beads bestows the fruits of black magic.

Sivapur&#x26;na
39. The thumb used in counting the number bestows salvation. The index finger destroys enemies. The middle finger bestows wealth. The ring finger brings about calmness and peace.

40-41. If there are hundred and eight beads that rosary is the most excellent. If it has hundred beads it is excellent. If it has fifty beads it is the middling. With fifty-four beads it is good. The Japa shall be performed with these different rosaries. They must not be exhibited to anyone.

42. The use of little finger in the Japa shall be avoided. In the act of Japa it is held to be auspicious. The Japa shall be performed by means of the thumb in contact with other fingers.

43. If Japa is performed without the thumb it is futile. If performed in the house it is ordinarily efficacious. If performed in the cowpen it is hundred times more.

44. In a holy forest or park it is thousand times more. On a holy mountain it is ten thousand times more. On the banks of a river it is hundred thousand times more.

45-46. They say that the Japa performed in a temple is a crore of times more efficacious. That performed in my presence is infinite number of times more efficacious. Japa in the presence of the sun, fire, preceptor, moon, lamp, water, brahmins and cows is commended. Sitting east of these is conducive to favourable control; south of these is of the same nature as black magic.

47-50. West of these is conducive to riches and north of these is peace-bestowing. If Japa is performed in the presence of sun, fire, brahmins, gods, preceptors and others one should not turn the face away from them. One should never perform Japa with the turban on, or wearing an armour or a bodice, in the nude, or with the hair dishevelled, or the neck covered, or without the Pavitra in the hand or while impure or while lamenting. While performing Japa the following must be avoided —anger, intoxication, sneezing, spitting, yawning and seeing a dog or a lowborn person. If they happen, Acamana shall be performed or I shall be remembered along with you.

51-53. Or he shall see the luminary bodies or he shall...



---

Vdyaviyasarhhita 1963
One should not perform Japa without a seat to sit on nor shall it be performed lying down, or standing up and walking. One shall not perform Japa in the open street or in an inauspicious place or in darkness. Legs shall not be stretched while performing the Japa nor shall one be in the cocklike posture, or seated in a vehicle or in a couch. Japa shall not be performed when one is worried. If one is competent one shall perform many Japas. Weak persons shall perform Japa according to capacity.

# 54.

Of what avail is much talk? Hear these words in brief. A person of good conduct, performing Japa and meditating purely attains welfare.

# 55.

Good conduct is the greatest virtue. It is the greatest wealth, the greatest knowledge and the greatest goal. A person devoid of good conduct is censured in the world. He will not be happy in the other world. Hence one must possess good conduct.

# 56.

Doing the duties prescribed by the Vedas, Sastras and the followers of the Vedas is meant by the word good conduct, nothing else.

# 57.

Good conduct is also the conduct of the good. Theism is the source of goodness.

# 58.

If he is a believer he will not err from the path of good conduct or commit errors or get defiled. Hence one shall be a believer in God and the Vedas.

# 59.

Faith is the conviction that happiness and misery are attained by means of good and evil deeds hereafter too just as in this world.

# 60.

O beloved, I shall tell you another secret which shall be guarded well. It shall not be mentioned to any one and every one or to an atheist brute.

# 61.

In the age of Kali there is no greater protective factor than the five-syllabled Mantra to a fallen or low-born person devoid of good conduct.

# 62.

This mantra is not ineffective when repeated by a person whether walking or standing or doing any other work or whether he is pure or impure.

261. Maim I. 108-110.

# 1964 Swa&#x26;ur&#x26;na

64. This mantra is not ineffective even if it is not properly imparted by the preceptor. It is not ineffective even in the case of persons not caring for good conduct and who have not purified the six paths.

65. This mantra is not ineffective in the case of a base-born, a fool, a deluded person, a fallen man and a lowly one transgressing the bounds of decency.

66. There is no doubt in this that this mantra becomes efficacious in the case of a man endowed with devotion to me whatever be his condition. It is not so in the case of other mantras. O mantra,

67. beloved, in the case of this the auspicious hour, date, star, day of the week etc. heed not be taken into consideration too much. It is ever wakeful, not slumbering.

68. This great mantra is never harmful to anyone. It may be either Susiddha, or Siddha or Sadhya.

69. It is Susiddha if it is imparted by a preceptor who is a Siddha. If it is imparted by a preceptor who is not a Siddha it is Siddha. The mere mantra is Sadhya.

70. If one has faith in me, the mantra and the preceptor, the mantra will undoubtedly be achieved whether it is Asadhita or Sadhita.

71. Hence a scholarly devotee shall resort to the five-syllabled mantra eschewing other mantras attended with risks in the matter of authorisation.

72. There is no guarantee that if the other mantras are achieved this mantra too will be achieved. But if this mantra is achieved all the other mantras will be achieved.

73. Just as, O goddess, I am not achieved even if the other gods are attained but if I am attained the other gods too are attained so also is the case with the Mantras.

74. Since this mantra functions without reference to castes, the defects found in the other mantras are not found in this mantra.

75. Still this mantra shall not be used for the trivial benefits or against insignificant opponents. Then alone this is very efficacious.

Upamanyu mid:

76. Thus the mode of repeating this mantra of five syllables was explained to the goddess by lord Siva himself for the benefit of the worlds.

77. He who glorifies this with devotion or listens to it with a pious mind is liberated from all sins and attains the greatest goal.

# CHAPTER FIFTEEN

# (The greatness of the Preceptor)

Sri Kr$na said:

1-2. O holy lord, the greatness of the mantra has been mentioned by you as well as the rules governing its practice as found in the Sruti itself. Now I wish to hear the details of Sivasamskara. While explaining the mode of accepting the mantra it has been slightly indicated.

Upamanyu said:

3. Well, I shall mention to you the holy and sin-destroying details of consecration as explained by Siva.

4. The consecration is so called because thereby the devotee is authorised in a splendid manner. It is the mode of purifying the six paths.

5. The same Samskara is called initiation because thereby the perfect knowledge is imparted and the bondage of Pasa is quelled.

6. The initiation as ordained by Siva the great Atman in the Sivagama is threefold—pertaining to Siva, Sakti and mantra.

7-8. The initiation of Siva is that whereby at the mere sight, touch and talk of the preceptor the individual soul gains immediately the consciousness quelling the bondage. It is twofold in view of the difference in the destruction of bondage, viz. acute and more acute.



---


# 9.</h9>
That is Tivratara whereby the bliss is immediately attained. The acute one purifies the sin of the living man effectively.

# 10.</h9>
The Sakti form of initiation coupled with knowledge is performed by the preceptor with knowledge for his vision, after entering the body of the disciple along the path of Yoga.

# 11.</h9>
The Mantra form of initiation is coupled with the rites performed in the sacrificial altar. This has to be performed by the preceptor externally with respect to the dull-witted disciple.

# 12.</h9>
The disciple receives blessing in respect of his Sakti, 262 because the pursuit of Saivite virtue has that as the condition in brief.

# 13.</h9>
Where the Sakti is not grasped neither purity nor Vidya nor right conduct nor salvation nor any achievement is secured.

# 14.</h9>
Hence, observing the symbols for securing Sakti, the preceptor shall purify and consecrate the disciple either by knowledge or by means of rites.

# 15.</h9>
He who performs otherwise is the wicked person who perishes. Hence the preceptor shall test the disciple in every respect.

# 16.</h9>
Since Sakti is enlightenment and bliss, the two are the signs of its manifestation.

# 17.</h9>
The symbol of bliss and enlightenment is constituted by the changes and alterations in the mind in the manner of shivering, horripilation and alterations in the voice, eyes and other parts of the body.

# 18.</h9>
The disciple too shall carry out the test of the preceptor through these characteristic symbols and contacts with him during the worship of Siva or through those associated with him or resorting to him.

# 19.</h9>
The test for the disciple has in view his worthiness of being taught and for the preceptor the gravity of his pursuit. Hence the disciple shall endeavour in every respect to honour the preceptor.

262. The Saktipata doctrine of the Saivas is concerned with the receptivity of the disciple or the communicability of the preceptor in receiving or imparting instructions in the principles of Saiva cult.



---

Vdyaviyasarhhitd 1967

20. He who is the preceptor is Siva and he who is Siva is the preceptor. Whether the preceptor or Siva the same person is stationed in the form of knowledge.

21. As is Siva so the knowledge. As is the knowledge so is the preceptor. The benefit is similar in the worship of Siva, knowledge or the preceptor.

22. The preceptor is in the form of gods and the mantras. Hence every endeavour shall be made to accept his behest with bent head.

23. The seeker of welfare shall never even think of transgressing the commands of the preceptor, because only he who carries out the behests of the preceptor attains the wealth of knowledge.

24. He shall not do any thing without the permission of the preceptor, nor even walk, stand, sleep or eat. Especially if the work is performed in the presence of the preceptor it must necessarily be with his permission.

25. Since the preceptor is the lord himself and his house is the temple of the lord, the disciple shall not sit as he pleases in the house of the preceptor or in his presence.

26-28. He becomes a fallen man due to his sins as due to the contact with the sinners. As the price of gold sheds off its impurities when put in fire so also the disciple sheds off his sins due to the contact with the preceptor. As the ghee melts when kept near the fire, so also the sin melts in the presence of the preceptor. As the blazing fire burns the twig whether dry or damp, so also the delighted preceptor burns off his sins.

29-31. The disciple shall never incite the anger of the preceptor mentally, verbally or physically. Due to his anger the longevity, prosperity, knowledge and sacred rites all these are burnt. The sacrifices of those who incite his anger are futile as also their restraints and observances. No doubt need be entertained in this respect. No man shall ever make any statement against the preceptor. If out of delusion he were to make such statements he will fall into the Raurava hell.

32-37. If the man is intelligent and seeks welfare he shall not act falsely to the preceptor mentally, verbally or



---


physically. Whether expressly bidden or not, the disciple shall perform what is beneficent and pleasing to the preceptor. He shall carry out his task in his presence or otherwise. He who conducts himself like this, who is ever devoted, alert in mind and performs what is pleasing to the preceptor is entitled to the Saivite rites. If the preceptor is intelligent, endowed with virtues, is capable of illumining the great bliss, knows reality and is attached to Siva he is competent to bestow salvation. None else. The principle of producing knowledge is born of great bliss. Only he by whom that principle is known can point out bliss and not the one who is that only in name but is devoid of true knowledge.

# A

Two boats can carry each other across the river. A piece of rock cannot take another piece of rock across the river. If the preceptor is nominal, the liberation too is nominal.

# 39.

Those by whom this principle is known are liberated and can liberate others. There can be no enlightenment, no realisation of the self in one who is devoid of principles.

# 40.

He who is devoid of realisation is an animal. One urged by an animal cannot eschew his animal nature.

# 41.

Hence, only a knower of principles is sought as the liberated and liberator. He is endowed with all characteristics and he is the knower of all Sastras.

# 42-43.

One devoid of principles is inefficient though he may know all means and rules of procedure. The greatest bliss is generated by the sight of the preceptor whose intellect extending up to personal realisation functions in the principle. Hence an intelligent person shall choose one as his preceptor who can impart enlightenment and bliss.

# 44-46.

The right preceptor shall be served by the disciples who desire salvation and who are expert in humble conduct to that end. When realisation dawns upon him he shall abide in him with stable devotion. He shall never eschew the principles nor neglect them. If neither enlightenment nor bliss is obtained by the disciple even after a year, even slightly, the disciple shall resort to another preceptor.

# 47.

Even though he may resort to another preceptor

V&#x26;yaviyasartihita 1969

he shall never dishonor his previous preceptor, his brothers, or sons or illum! ners or urgers.

48-49. Having at the outset approached the brahmin preceptor who has mastered the Vedas, who is intelligent, handsome, of pleasant sight, the bestower of protection and merciful, he shall propitiate him and endeavour to delight him mentally, verbally and physically.

50. He shall continue to propitiate him till he is pleased. If the preceptor is pleased the sins of the disciple are immediately quelled.

51-52. Hence he shall give the preceptor coins, gems, fields, houses, ornaments, garments, vehicles, beds, seats etc. in accordance with his wealth and resources. If he wishes for the great goal he shall not be stringent with regard to wealth.

53. Since he is his father, mother, master, kinsman, wealth, happiness, friend, comrade etc. he shall offer everything to him.

54. After offering these, he shall dedicate to him, himself, his family and all his possessions along with water and remain subservient to him for ever.

55. Since he has offered himself to Siva as his devotee he shall ever remain so. He will have no rebirth thereafter.

56. The teacher shall test the brahmin disciple for a year, the ksatriya for two years and the vaisya for three years.

57. He shall test the disciples, with commands to give up life and wealth or by engaging the superior devotees in mean tasks and the inferior ones in noble tasks.

58. Even when rebuked or beaten if they do not feel distressed they shall be considered self-controlled and pure and hence deserving consecration in Saiva rituals.

59-61. The decision of the sacred texts is this that brahmin devotees with the following qualifications shall be consecrated properly and enlightened. They shall be non-violent, merciful, ever active and alert in mind, free from arrogance, intelligent, devoid of rivalry, sweet-tongued, straightforward, soft-hearted, pure, humble, steady, endowed with purity of conduct, and well-behaved in every respect.

62. Women by themselves are not authorised in Saivite consecration. If they are devoted to the lord they can be consecrated at the instance of their husbands.

63-64. A widow can be consecrated with the permission of her sons; a virgin with the permission of her father. The purificatory rite for the pathways is not prescribed for Sudra men, particularly the fallen ones and the intercastes. If they have pious feelings for Siva, the purification of sins shall be performed by administering holy washings of his feet.

65-67. The consecratory rite for people born of Anuloma marriage shall be performed in the manner customary to the family of the mother. The girl who is authorised in Saivite rites by her father shall be given in marriage only to a devotee of Siva and not to a non-devotee. If inadvertently she is given in marriage to a non-devotee she shall try to convince her husband about the Saivite faith. If she is unable to do so she shall leave him off and perform holy rites mentally.

68-70. The chaste lady Anasuya abandoned her husband Atri the excellent sage and propitiated Siva by penance; Draupadi who was not engaged in holy rites of the elders propitiated Narayana by penance and attained the Pandavas as her husbands. In view of the weightiness of Siva’s behest, the woman engaged in Saivite virtue does not incur sin as she has no choice of freedom.

71-72. Of what avail is much talk? Whoever solely resorts to Siva shall be purified if he is subservient to the preceptor. The rite of consecration does not differ. He who develops consciousness by the mere sight, touch or talk of the preceptor is not faced with failure.

73-74. The mental consecratory rite which is performed along the path of Yoga is not mentioned here. It is a great secret and shall be known straight from the mouth of the preceptor. The consecratory rite with holy rites shall now be mentioned briefly. Its detailed explanation is not possible.

# CHAPTER SIXTEEN

# (The consecration of the disciple)

Upamanyu said :

1. On an auspicious day, in a pure spot devoid of major defects, the preceptor shall at the outset perform the consecration 'Samaya.'
2. After testing the ground duly by way of smell, colour, taste etc., he shall cause a platform to be constructed along the path mentioned in the science of architecture.
3. After making the altar, he shall make eight pits in the eight quarters making the chief one in the north-east. It may also be in the west when only the important pit need be dug. It shall be beautified by smearing it with powder.
4. It shall be decorated with garlands, festoons, banners and canopy. In the middle of the altar a mystic diagram shall be drawn. It shall have auspicious characteristics.
5. The powder used for the mystic diagram shall be gold dust mixed with saffron so as to befit for the invocation of the lord. If the devotee is poor he can use the powdered Nivara grain mixed with saffron.
6. The width of the mystic lotus diagram may be one hand or two hands. It may be white or red in colour. The pericarp of the lotus of a hand’s width shall be eight angulas.
7. The filaments shall be half that length. The remaining portion is occupied by the eight petals. If the width of the lotus is two hands, the measurements will be doubled.
8. Another diagram shall be made on the altar one hand in width or half of it, to the north-east of the previous one and decorated well.
9. Paddy or rice grains mixed with gingelly seeds and flowers shall be strewn on it and covered with Darbha grass. The water-jar with the necessary characteristics shall be placed thereon.
10. The water-jar shall be made of gold, silver or copper or it may be earthen. It shall contain scents, flowers,

Aksatas, Ku£a and Durva grass. It shall be tied round with two cloths and a white thread round the neck. It shall be filled with pure water with a bundle of Ku§a grass inserted in it. It shall contain the materials of worship and a covering lid.

13-14. The vessels Bhrngara and Vardhani as well as Sankha and Cakra shall also be put. Except the thread the other thing may consist of lotus petals and leaves. On the northern petal of the lotus conceived as seat shall be placed the Vardhani of the Astraraja (?) with sandal paste and water.

15. To the east of the diagram the great worship of the lord shall start on the consecrated jar.

16-19. What has been mentioned before can be performed on the seashore, or river-bank, or in the cowpen or on a mountain, or in a temple or in the house or in any other charming place, except the platform. After making the diagram as before and the raised ground for fire the preceptor shall enter the worship chamber with a delighted face. He shall invoke all auspicious things about him. He shall have completed all the daily rites. He shall perform the great worship in the middle of the mystical diagram. He shall invoke Siva again in the water-jar and worship.

20-21. He shall meditate upon the lord the protector of sacrifice facing the west. In the vessel Astravardhani he shall worship the weapon of the lord on the south. He shall place the Mantra in the Mantra vessel. Expert in the mantras he shall exhibit the mystic gestures and begin the sacrifice with the mantra.

22. The excellent preceptor shall perform the sacrifice in the sacred fire in the main pit. The other brahmins shall perform the sacrifice all round in the other pits.

23. The excellent preceptor shall perform the sacrifice only in the main pit. The number of sacrifices made by the others is half or one fourth of those of the chief priest.

24. Some shall recite the Vedic mantras or auspicious hymns. Some shall perform the Japa duly.

25-26. Dance, music, instrumental as well as vocal, and other auspicious conventional rites shall be performed.

After propitiating the assembled brahmins he shall make them recite the Punyaha mantras. He shall then worship. He shall pray to the lord with a desire to bless the disciple.

# 27.

‘O lord of the chief of gods be pleased. O lord, ocean of mercy, please enter my body mercifully and release me from the bondage.

The preceptor shall perform the Samkalpg. ‘I shall do thus and with the formal permission, he shall bring the disciple who had been observing fast taking only Havi§ya once and who had taken bath and performed daily rites. The disciple shall continue the Japa of Pranava and meditate on the lord. Auspicious rites shall then be performed for him. In the Mandala in front of the western or the southern door he shall be made to sit on the Darbha grass. The disciple shall sit facing the north.

# 31-32.

The preceptor shall stand facing the cast and sprinkle the water from the vessel Proksani, on his head as the disciple sits straight with palms joined in reverence. He shall lightly touch with flowers the eyes of the disciple and bind them with a strip of new silk cloth repeating the mantras.

40-41. He shall worship the lord duly and perform three Ahutis. He shall sit as before. The preceptor shall touch the disciple with the tips of the Darbha grass. By means of his Vidya he shall enter the Atman. After bowing to the lord he shall perform the rite of Nadisandhan?

42-44. He shall perform the rite of Prananirgama as mentioned in Siva Sastras. Remembering the mystical entry into the body of the disciple he shall perform the Tarpana rite with the mantras. For the Tarpana he shall offer thrice the ten Ahutis with the ancillary mantras. After offering the Purnahuti, the expert preceptor shall offer again ten Ahutis repeating the Mulamantra, by way of expiation.

45-46. Worshipping the lord of the gods again and performing the Acamana the preceptor shall perform Homa duly and uplift the disciple from his caste. If he is a vaiSya he is first lifted into a k$atriya. Then performing these rites the preceptor shall lift Him into a brahmin.

47. If the disciple is a ksatriya he is first raised into a brahmin and then to the form of Rudra. If the disciple is a brahmin he is raised into the form of Rudra.

1-8-49. After sprinkling and striking lightly the disciple and remembering the Atman of the disciple in his own, the preceptor shall drain out the wind that throbs like a flame, through the veins as mentioned. He shall then enter the vein and the heart of the disciple.

50. After entering his consciousness that appears to him like a blue spot he shall meditate on it as blazing with its brilliance free from dirt.

51-52. After breathing in the vein repeating the mantra and showing the Samhara mudra (the gesture of annihilation) he shall refill it with Puraka for uniting the Atmans. Now taking it again with Kumbhaka as with Recaka before, he shall place it in the heart of the disciple.

53. After touching him and giving him the sacred thread secured from Siva he shall offer three Ahutis and the Purnahuti thereafter.

54-56. To the south of the Jord, the disciple is made to

He shall face the east and sitting in a splendid seat shall repeat the mantras with the auspicious songs and music and take the water-jar. Meditating on the joyous Siva he shall pour water over the disciple.

58. He shall make him sit as before on the Ku£a seat and worship the lord in the Mandala. He shall perform the Karanyasa rite.

59. Meditating on the lord he shall take Bhasma in both the hands and smear it over the body of the disciple repeating Siva’s names.

60-61. He shall then perform the rites of Dahana and Plavana and conclude with the rite of Matrkanyasa. Meditating on Siva’s seat and invoking him on the head of the disciple he shall mentally worship him in the prescribed manner.

62. With palms joined in reverence he shall pray to the lord. ‘Stay here permanently’. After submitting this he shall remember him shining with refulgent splendour.

63. After worshipping Siva and securing his behest in the form of Siva he shall slowly mutter Siva’s Mantra into the ear of the disciple.

68. ‘Better to abandon life, better to cut off the head than to take food without worshipping the three-eyed lord.’

69. The lord alone will invariably give till the delusion is removed. The disciple shall propitiate the lord with concentrated devotion till delusion is quelled.

70. Thereafter the disciple will be known as Samaya in the preceptor’s hermitage. He shall carry out the behests of the preceptor and remain subservient to him.

71. Then after performing the rite of Karanyasa the preceptor shall take the Bhasma with his own hand and hand it over to the disciple along with the Mulamantra and the Rudrak$a over which the mantra has been repeated.

72. If it is possible he shall give him the phallic264 or the embodied idol of the lord, the requisites of worship, sacrifice, Japa and meditation.

# CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

# ( The rules governing Saivite initiation)

Upamanyu said:

1. Hereafter the preceptor shall perform the purification of the six pathways after understanding the disciple's capacity, for the sake of liberation from bondage.
2. The six paths are Kala, Tattva, Bhuvana, Varna, Pada and Mantra in brief.
3. The five Kalas, Nivrtti etc. are the pathway of Kala. The five Kalas pervade the five paths.
4. The principles from Sivatattva to the earth constitute the paths of principles. They are twentysix, both pure and impure.
5. Those beginning with Adhara and ending with Unmana constitute the paths of worlds. They are sixty in number without difference and subsidiary divisions.
6. The fifty letters in the form of Rudras constitute the path of letters. The path of words has many varieties.
7. The path of mantras consisting of subsidiary Mantras is pervaded by the excellent mantra. Just as Siva, the leader of Tattvas, is not included among Tattvas so also the leader of Mantras is not included in the path of Mantra. The Kaladhva pervades and the other Adhvas are pervaded.
8. He who does not know that factually should not perform the rite of the six Adhvas. He who has not understood the form of the six paths cannot understand the order of pervasiveness and is incompetent to perform the rite.
9. After making the pits and the Mandapa as before, to the east he shall make the mystic diagram measuring two hastas for keeping the water-jar on. The preceptor shall perform his routine rites and enter the Mandapa with his disciples to begin the worship of Siva as before. Milk pudding shall be made with rice measuring not less than one Adhaka. Half of that shall be offered to the lord as Naivedya and the remaining shall be kept reserved for Homa.

The purificatory rites of the six pathways are the pre-requisites for the initiation of the disciple in Siva's cult.

# CHAPTER TWENTYTWO

(The compulsory and optional rites of Saivite Scriptures)

Upamanyu said: —

1. Nyasa is of three types: Sthiti, Utpatti and Laya. The first is for householders, the second for Brahmacarins, the third for ascetics, forest-dwellers and widows. For housewives the Sthitinyasa is recommended.
2. For a virgin Utpatti Nyasa is praiseworthy. I shall now mention the characteristics of the Nyasas. The procedure from the thumb to the little finger is the Sthitinyasa. The procedure from the right thumb to the left little finger is the Utpattinyasa. The reverse is Samhrti (Laya).
3. The letters “Na” etc. along with the Bindus shall be fixed in order in the fingers. Siva shall be fixed on the palms and on the little fingers.
4. The Astranyasa shall be made in the ten quarters by means of the Astramantra. The five Kalas—Nivrtti etc. in the form of the five elements along with the lords of the elements and accompanied by their respective symbols shall be fixed in the chest, neck, palate, middle of the eye-brows and the Brahmarandhra. One shall conceive them in the different Bijas.
5. In order to purify them one shall perform the Japa of the five-syllabled mantra. Restraining the vital breath thrice he shall cut off the knot of the elements repeating the Astra mantra and showing the mystic gesture of Astra. The Atman urged by the vital breath through the Susumna vein and going out through the Brahmarandhra shall be united with the Saivite splendour.
6. Afterwards the body is withered up by the wind burnt by the deadly fire. Then upwardly the Kalas are dissolved through the wind. Dissolving the burnt body and touching the Kalas with the ocean he shall drench and flood the body through Amjrtas and keep it in its normal.

Nyasa is an assignment of the various parts of the body to the deity. It is usually accompanied with prayer and corresponding gesticulation. This forms an essential part of Karma-Yajfia.

place. Killed and burnt without the creation of Kala he shall flood with Amfta that which is reduced to ashes.

14. In the body consisting of Vidya, he shall join the Atman that has come out of Siva in the form of the flame of a lamp. He shall join it through the Brahmarandhra.

15. After meditating on the Atman that has entered the body, in the lotus of the heart, he shall sprinkle with the shower of nectar the body consisting of Vidya.

16. Then he shall perform the rite of Karanyasa after duly purifying it. Thereafter he shall perform the Dehanyasa by means of the great Mudra.

17. After performing the rite of Anganyasa in the manner mentioned by Siva, he shall perform the Varnanyasa in the joints of hands, feet and other parts of the body.

18. After the Nyasa of the six limbs accompanied by six types, he shall bind the quarters from the south-east onwards.

19. Or he need perform only the Nyasa of the five limbs beginning with the head. Similarly the Nyasa of six limbs without the rites of purification etc. of the Bhutas shall be performed.

20. Thus he shall succinctly perform the purification of the body and Atman. Attaining the status of Siva he shall worship ParameSvara.

21. He who has sufficient leisure and is not confused in mind shall perform the rite of Nyasa in a detailed manner.

22-23. The first is Maq-kanyasa; the next is Brahma-nyasa; Prapavanyasa is the third; the next is Hamsa Nyasa and the fifth Nyasa is mentioned as Paficak§aratmaka (consisting of the five-syllabled mantra).

24-29. The Nyasa of the various letters is as follows: the letter A in the head; A in the forehead; ‘I* and I in the eyes; “U” and “U” in the ears; “R” and “R” in the cheek; ‘lr’ and ‘lr’ in the nostrils; ‘e’ and “ai” in the lips; o and “au” in the rows of teeth; -‘am” in the tongue and “a^” in the palate; the gutturals are in the five joints of the right hand; the palatals in the joints of the left hand; The hnguals and the Dentals in the legs; Pa and Pha in the sides; “Ba” in the back and “Bha” in the navel; “Ma” in the heart; “Ya” to “Sa” in the seven constituent elements.

skin etc; “ha” in the cavity of the heart and “k$a” in the middle of the eyebrows.

# 30.

After performing the Nyasa of the letters in the manner of fifty Rudras the five Brahmans shall be fixed in the limbs, face etc. and Kala.

# 31.

The Karanyasa may or may not be performed through them. The Brahmans shall be fixed in the head, face, chest, private parts and legs.

# 32.

The Kalas of liana are five; these are fixed in the five faces beginning with the one above and ending with the one in the west.

# 33.

Then the four Kalas of Puru$a shall be fixed in the four faces beginning with the one in the east.

# 34-36.

The eight Kalas of Aghora shall be fixed in the heart, neck, shoulders, navel, belly, back and the chest; then the thirteen Kalas of Vamadeva are fixed in the anus, penis, thighs, knees, calves, hips, buttocks, sides, nose, head and the arms. Thus the experts perform the Nyasa of the thirty-eight Kalas in due order.

# 37-41.

Afterwards the experts of Pranava shall perform the Pranavanyasa in the arms, elbows, wrists, sides, belly, thighs, calves and the back. After performing the Pranavanyasa thus, the expert devotee shall perform the Hamsanyasa as mentioned in Saivite scriptures, in the eyes, nostrils, arms, eyes, face, forehead, armpits sides, breasts, hips, hands and heels. Or in the manner of five limbs the Nyasa shall be performed. Then he shall perform the Nyasa of the five-syllabled mantra.

# 42-44.

Hereby Sivahood is generated along the path as mentioned before. A non-Siva shall neither practise the mantra of Siva nor worship Siva nor meditate upon Siva nor attain Siva. Hence one shall dedicate himself to Siva and eschew his identity. Thinking “I am Siva” one shall perform Saivite rites, viz. Karmayajfia, Tapoyajfia, Japayajfia, Dhyanayajfta and Jftanayajfta.

# 45-46.

Some are engaged in Karmayajfia; others in Tapoyajfia; still others in Japayajfia; others in Dhyanayajfta; and others in Jfianayajfla. The latter ones are better than

1998 Sivapurana

Karmayajfta is of two kinds: one with a specific desire and the other without that.

47-51. A person with a desire, even when he enjoys those pleasures, becomes more and more attached to lust. If he is without desire, he enjoys pleasures in Rudra’s abode and after a descent therefrom is reborn as a person engaged in Tapoyajfia. There is no doubt in this. An ascetic enjoys pleasures in Rudra’s abode and after a fall therefrom is reborn in the world as a man devoted to Japa and Dhyana. Such a man devoted to Japa and Dhyana, thanks to their excellence, attains knowledge ere long, and thereby attains Siva’s Sayujya. Hence he becomes a liberated soul even when he is devoted to Karmayajfia at the behest of Siva, if he is without desire. But a person with lust will always be in bondage. Hence one shall be devoted to Dhyana and Jftana among the five Yajrias.

52-55. He who has meditation and knowledge crosses the ocean of worldly existence. Dhyanayajfia, which is freedom from the defects of violence etc., is a pure mental process for salvation and is therefore the greatest means. Just as the persons working outside the palace are seen not enjoying much of the benefits within the royal palace, so also the Karmins. To those who meditate, the subtle body of Isvara becomes visible. But to the Karmins, only the clay, wood etc. are visible. Hence those who are devoted to Dhyanayajfia do not accept deities in the form of stone and clay, since they know the reality of Siva.

56-57. The man who eschews Siva stationed in the Atman and worships him externally resigns the fruit in his hand and licks his elbow. From knowledge, meditation is generated and from meditation knowledge functions better. Through these two, one attains liberation. Hence one shall be devoted to meditation.

58-61. One shall worship the lord and the goddess by means of external service, or with the mind full of faith meditate on them in the twelve-petalled lotus, head, forehead, the middle of the eyebrows, the tip of the nose, face, neck, heart, navel or in any permanent spot. Or he shall worship in a phallic image or an embodied idol or in an...

# [A gloss on the rules governing worship]

Upamanyu said:

1. I shall briefly give a commentary to the rules governing worships mentioned by Siva to Siva in the Saivite scriptures.
2. With or without performing the internal worship which is its ancillary and which concludes with the rites in fire, one shall perform the external worship.

15. In her right hand she bears a shining golden lotus. She is seated on a splendid seat with the other hand placed on it like a supporting staff.

16-19. She splits the Pala. She is in the form of existence, knowledge and bliss. After conceiving the lord and the goddess thus and meditating on them in an excellent auspicious seat, the devotee shall worship with piety as flowers along with all types of service. Or he can conceive the form of the lord in any of the following ways: — as Siva, Sadasiva, Mahesvara, or as one having the name of twenty-six principles or as Srikantha. Just as Mantra Nyasa is performed in the body so also in this form the devotee can meditate on embodied Siva who is beyond Sat and Asat as in the manner of external worship. He shall complete the worship mentally.

It shall be encircled by high walls with the ornamental gateway as lofty as a mountain. It shall be studded with gems. The doors shall be made of gold.

It must have a hundred columns of molten gold studded with gems. The canopy shall be embellished with pearls and the festoons at the gateway shall be brightened with corals.

It shall be guarded by heroic guards and watch-

Men equipped with elephants, horses and chariots. It shall contain many flower gardens, lakes, and tanks in the different quarters. It shall be inhabited by the brahmin devotees of Siva, who must know the truth of the Vedas and Vedanta, who are devoted to Saivite scriptures, who are engaged in Saivite way of life, who must have the characteristics prescribed in Saivite scriptures, who must be quiet, prosperous and devoted to good conduct, who have smiling faces and who follow lord Siva.

45-48. All people whether rich or poor shall worship the lord with devotion through the wealth legitimately earned by them. They shall worship in a place built by the people according to their capacity. The temple shall be built in stone, or ivory, or wood or brick or even clay. It may be in a holy forest or on a mountain or on the banks of a river. The worship may be performed in any other holy spot or in the house. Even if the wealth is illegitimately acquired he does not incur sin or hindrance if he worships Siva with devotion since the lord is subservient to piety.

49. If one worships without devotion even with legitimately earned wealth he does not derive the benefit thereof. Devotion alone is the main concern.

50. The benefit of even a little or a great service rendered by a poor or a rich man, according to the affluence, to Siva with devotion is the same.

51. Even a poor man urged by devotion, may do what a rich man devoid of devotion will not do.

52. If a man devoid of devotion were to dedicate his entire possession to Siva he will not derive the benefit thereof. Devotion is the sole criterion.

53. Without this none can go to the divine city of Siva 283 through any sort of penances.

54. O Krsna, this is the secret of secrets in regard to the lord. There is no doubt that a devotee becomes liberated through devotion.

55. The Japa of Siva’s Mantra meditation, Homa, Yajha, penance, learning, charitable gift, study of Vedas— all

these are conducive to piety. There is no doubt about this.

# 56.

A person devoid of piety and devotion is not liberated even after doing everything but one with devotion is liberated even without doing anything.

# 57.

To a devotee of Siva, of what avail are thousands of Candrayanas, 284 hundreds of Prajapatyas, 285 and other monthly fasts.

# 58.

In this world, even non-devotees perform penances in mountain caves for the enjoyment of insignificant pleasures. But only a devotee is liberated through pious feelings.

# 59.

The Sattvic activity yields salvation. Yogins abide by the Sattvaguna. The ritualists perform Rajasic rites bestowing Siddhis because they are enveloped by Rajas Guna.

# 60.

Asuras and Rak$asas possessing Tamas Guna and men of that ilk worship the lord for securing worldly pleasures.

# 61.

Whether the attitude is Sattvic, Rajasic or Tamasic one performing worship etc. with devotion attains welfare.

# 62.

Since devotion is a boat that saves one from the ocean of sins, of what avail are Rajas and Tamas to one who is endowed with devotion?

# 63.

O Kfgpa, a low born, a base or a fool, or a fallen man, if he resorts to Siva is worthy of being worshipped by the gods and Asuras. 286

# 64.

Hence, by all means, one shall worship Siva with devotion alone, since non-devotees secure no benefit from anywhere.

my 65. O Kfsna, I shall tell you a great secret. Listen to words. This is what has been decided conclusively by the Vedas, scriptures and those who know them, after careful consideration.

# CHAPTER TWENTYSIX

# (The worship of Siva with the ancillary rites)

Upamanyu said:

1. Even a slayer of brahmin, a wine-addict, a thief, a defiler of the preceptor’s bed, one guilty of matricide or patricide, a murderer of a hero and one guilty of destroying a child in the womb becomes absolved of those sins within twelve years by worshipping Siva with devotion even without mantras.
2. Hence by all means let even a fallen man worship Siva sustaining himself on alms and conquering the sense-organs. This he shall do if he is a devotee and none else.
3. Even if one commits a great sin he is liberated from that if he worships the lord of the gods with devotion, repeating the five-syllabled mantra.
4. There are many persons who live solely on water or air and who emaciate their bodies by means of holy rites. They cannot attain Sivaloka through these rites.
5. He who worships Siva even once with devotion repeating the five-syllabled mantra goes to the abode of Siva due to the efficacy of the mantra of Siva.
6. Hence the penances and the sacrifices wherein the entire possession may be given as Dakṣinā, are not equal to even a croreth part of the worship of Siva.
7. Whether bound or free, if the devotee worships with the five-syllabled mantra he is liberated. No doubt need be entertained in this respect.
8. Whether a man is a follower of Rudra or not, whether



---


# Vayuviyasarhkitd

he is fallen or deluded if he worships but once with Rudra Sukta he is liberated.

10. A devotee of Siva who has conquered anger, whether he has or has not secured grace shall worship the lord with the Suktamantra or the six-syllabled mantra.

11. Surely the former is better than the latter. He becomes liberated and absorbed into Brahman.

12. Hence one shall always worship Siva with devotion repeating the mantras, once, twice or thrice or always.

13-15. Those who worship the lord shall be known as Mahe£varas themselves. If one does not worship him through knowledge assisted by the prompting of the soul he suffers for long in the world which is an ocean of misery. Even after attaining the rare human body, if a deluded individual does not worship Siva, his life becomes futile since it does not lead to salvation. After attaining the rare human birth those who worship the lord are excellent and blessed. Their life alone is fruitful.

16-19. Those who are devoted to the lord, whose minds are inclined to him and who endeavour to remember the lord are never subjected to misery. The fruit of the worship of Siva is the sufficient wealth, charming houses and women folk seductively bedecked in ornaments. Those who desire great pleasures and kingdom in heaven shall love his lotus feet for ever. Good fortune, handsome and brilliant features, good strength, compassionate and renouncing temperament, heroism, fame in the world—all these are secured by one who worships the lord.

20-22. So desiring welfare, one shall invariably worship Siva, forsaking everything else and dedicating the mind solely to him. The life passes off quickly. Youth goes off rapidly. Sickness approaches all too suddenly. Hence the lord shall be worshipped. Worship Siva before death overtakes you, before old age attacks you, before the sense-organs become atrophied and inefficient.

23-28. Realising that there is no holy rite in the three worlds, on a par with the worship of Siva, SadaSiva shall be worshipped assiduously. If the worship is conducted in a palace the following rites too shall be performed—sacrifice at

After offering libation the devotee or his servant shall offer oblation to the attendants in the palace. The devotee shall come out to the accompaniment of instrumental music and facing the northern direction he shall offer flowers, incense, lamp and cooked rice with water. Then he shall stand on the Mahapifha facing the north and offer oblations. Thereafter, whatever had been offered to the lord before, as Naivedya, cooked rice shall be offered to Canqla as l^aivedya. The remnants also shall be offered thus.

29-30. Performing Homa, the latter part of worship shall be concluded. After conducting the regular rites he shall perform the perpetual festivities, Japa etc. in accordance with the injunction in Saivite scriptures. In a large metallic vessel shining splendidly with a red lotus the divine Pa£upata missile shall be invoked and worshipped.

31-35. The vessel shall be carried on the head by a Saivite brahmin well-bedecked. He shall hold a lighted torch. With dances and songs to the accompaniment of auspicious instrumental music the party shall make three circumambulations round the palace of the lord. The movement shall be neither quick nor slow. Thereafter the devotee shall stand at the door with palms joined in reverence shall take it in and ritualistically dismiss the Astra. After one more circumambulation he shall offer eight flowers and conclude the worship.

In the month of Octo-November when the moon is in conjunction with the star Kfttika he shall light a thousand ’amps. In the month of Nov-December on the Ardra star he shall perform the ablution of Siva with ghee.

# 13.

Those who are unable to perform the rites on the respective occasions shall perform the festival in the big hall of the temple or perform worship or more.

# 14-16.

On occasions when commendable rites shall be performed, when the mind is afflicted and dejected, when the conduct of life has become defiled, when bad dreams occur, when wicked men are seen, when inauspicious portents occur or when afflicted by great ailments, the devotee shall perform ceremonial ablutions, worships, Japas, meditations, sacrifices and other rites and offer charitable gifts suitably along with Purascarana. When the series of Siva-fire is broken it shall be revived.

number of holy rites goes beyond the two worlds, to the end of the universe and the unmanifest above, and reaches the Paurusa and Raudra regions of Siva. After enjoying the pleasures there in diverse ways for thousands of Yugas when the merit is exhausted he reaches the earth and is born in a great and noble family. There also due to the previous impressions, he will eschew brutish activities and be engaged in Saivite holy rites. Meditating well due to the holy rites he will attain Siva’s city.

27-28. After enjoying extensive pleasures he will attain the region of Vidyesvaras. After enjoying the vast pleasures along with Vidyesvaras he will return for once either within or outside the universe. Thereafter he will secure the perfect knowledge of Siva and the great devotion. After attaining identity with Siva he does not return again.

29-30. A person who is devoted to Siva even as the others are devoted to sensual objects shall be liberated whether he performs or does not perform the Saivite holy rites. He returns once, twice, or thrice but ultimately does not return.

31-32. He becomes an emperor and is invested with the right in the Saivite ritual. If one desires welfare one shall seek refuge in Siva and resort to his holy rites. But we do not compel anyone through any means.

33-35. Neither importunities nor over-discussions are appealing. The Saivite rites appeal to some others by virtue of the merits they bestow and the previous impressions they invoke if the cause of worldliness in their case is not competent to help. Hence, if one longs for the welfare of the Atman, one shall ponder over all these things in accordance with his nature and engage himself in the Saivite holy rites.

# Description of K&#x26;mya rites

Lord Krfna said:

1. O holy lord, the compulsory and optional rites of those who depend on him, as mentioned by Siva, have been heard by me from your mouth itself which is to be as much respected as the Vedas.
2. Now I wish to hear if there is any Kamya rite for those who are authorized in Saivite rites. It behoves you to mention it.

Vpamatiyu said:

Some rites yield benefit here itself. Some yield benefit hereafter. Both of them are of five types. Some rites are in the form of activities, some in the form of penance, some in the form of Japas, some in the form of meditation, some in the form of all these. Those in the form of activities are the rites of Homa and worship.
The rites can be fruitful only for those who have all Saktis. Sakti is the behest of Siva the great Atman.
Hence only the brahmin who upholds the behest shall perform the Kamya rites. Now I shall mention the Kamya rites yielding benefit here and hereafter.
The internal rites shall be performed by the followers of Siva and the external by the followers of MaheSvara. In fact the followers of Siva and of Mahesvara are not different even as Siva and Mahesvara are not different. Men engaged in the sacrifice of knowledge are the followers of Siva and seek refuge in him. Those who are engaged in the sacrifice of activities are the followers of Mahesvara. Saivas shall perform internal and the Mahesvaras external rites.
In the rite which is going to be mentioned the procedure is not different. The ground shall be tested through smell, colour and taste. It shall be desirable. A canopy shall be spread above. The ground shall be well-scrubbed and smeared to appear like the surface of a mirror. Along the path, as seen in the sacred scriptures he shall consecrate.

---


# 84.

Hence if he wishes for the achievement of proper benefits he shall perform the Kamya rites attending to all the items scrupulously and avoiding indifference.

# 85.

After concluding worship thus and bowing to the lord and the goddess he shall concentrate his mind with devotion and repeat eulogical hymns.

# 86.

# 89.

He can give them to the devotees of Siva or hand them over to the temple of Siva.

# 90.

Or he shall worship the lord in the Siva-fire with the seven articles of sacrifice after duly worshipping the Avarana deities.

# 91.

This rite is Yogesvara. Nowhere in the world is there a Yoga superior to this.

# 92.

A benefit of this world or the next unattainable through this does not exist anywhere.

# 93.

We cannot fix like this — “This is the fruit thereof, this is not the fruit.” This rite is the excellent means of benefits by way of welfare.

# 94.

This can be said that whatever is solicited is obtained as fruit from this as from the wish-yielding precious stone.

# 95.

Still none shall perform this rite for trivial benefits. A man praying for a small help from a great man demeans himself.

# 96.

If the rite is performed surely the desired fruit. It is a fabulous gem that yields the possessor his desires. It is also a mantra that confers the desired fruit.



---


2034 Sivapurdna shall be achieved. Whatever rite is performed, let it be performed with the lord as aim.

97. Hence, an expert man shall perform this rite for the conquests of his enemy or death even if those fruits are not to be secured from any one else whether those fruits are seen or unseen.

98. When great sins are committed, when there is a terror of great epidemics, famine or any other calamity, this rite shall be performed for the pacification of the evil.

99. Of what avail is much talk? The lord has said that this is the spiritual missile to be used by the devotees of Siva, to ward off great mishaps.

100. Hence, a person performing this rite with the conviction that there is no greater protection for the Atman enjoys the benefit.

101. He who reads the hymn with purity of body and mind attains an eighth of the benefit desired.

102. If any one thinks into the hymn, observes fast on the full moon and the new moon days and recites it on those days or on the eighth or fourteenth day, he shall derive half the benefit.

103. He who thinks over the meaning, observes rites on Parvan and other days and performs the Japa of this stotra for a month derives full benefit.

1. O Kr§na, I shall tell you the hymn whereby this holy rite of Yogesvara is concluded along the path of five Avaranas. Be victorious, O Siva, the sole lord of the universe, naturally charming one, of the nature of eternal knowledge.

You are the principle beyond the region of words and minds O lord, who have transcended the confused universe.

10-12. The entire universe including the gods and Asuras is subservient into you. Hence who is competent to transgress the behest ordained by you? This devotee is solely dependent on you. Hence, O sir, bless me and bestow on me what I have prayed for.

13. Be victorious, O goddess, the mother of the universe identical with the universe, and of unlimited prosperity. Be victorious, O goddess of incomparable beautiful person.

14. Be victorious, O goddess transcending speech and mind annihilating the darkness of ignorance, devoid of birth and old age, O one superior to that which is superior to Kala.

23-26. Lords Heramba and Sanmukha are the beloved sons of Siva and Siva. Their accomplishments are auspicious. They are omniscient. They imbibe the nectar of knowledge. Being content they are mutually affectionate. They are perpetually honoured by Siva and Siva. They are always respected and revered by Brahma and other gods. They are always ready to protect the worlds. Out of their will they take incarnations with their many different parts. They have been always worshipped thus by me on either side of Siva and Siva. May they grant me what I have prayed for with due deference for their behest.

27-29. May the lord grant me what I have prayed for the lord who resembles the pure crystal, who is called Isana, Sadasiva, the great Atman, who is quiescent, who occupies the firmament transcending the Santikala, who is the final Bija of the five-syllabled mantra equipped with five Kalas.

They are uncomparable and devoid of conflicting pairs of defaults. They are free from dangers. They are accompanied by their Saktis and followers. They are bowed to by the world. They are competent to create and annihilate the worlds. They are mutually loving and accommodating. They are very affectionate and respectful to one another. They are favourites of Siva and are marked by his traits. They are gentle, terrible and mixture of both. They are in the midway between the two. They are ugly, good-featured and multi featured.

The sun is the Miirti with illuminated disc of Mahesa. He is Nirguna, Gunasahkirna, Gunakevala, and Avikaratmaka. The first one is single with general variations.

Other good men particularly those who are wedded to Saivite discipline — permit this holy rite which is the instrument for achieving my purpose.

173-174. The followers of Siva who adhere to the philosophical path, those who perform the Pasupata rites, those who observe the holy rites and the Saivite holy men such as Kapalikas — all these are adherents and executors of Siva’s behests. They shall be worshipped by me at the behest of Siva. May these bless me. Let them praise the successful holy rite.

175. Those who adhere to the path of knowledge according to the southerners, those who follow the southern cult and the northern cult abide by me, without mutual clash since I wish and seek the welfare through the mantras.

177. Of what avail is the long eulogy? Let all the faithful bless me. Let all good men pronounce everything auspicious.

178. Obeisance to Siva accompanied by Siva. Obeisance to you the primordial cause accompanied by your son. Obeisance to you encircled by the universe in the form of five Avaranas.

185. When bad dreams and evil portents occur indicating terror and danger this hymn shall be repeated. Then those dangers do not befall.

186. The man who regularly performs the Japa of this hymn obtains longevity, health, prosperity and everything else desired!

187. The benefit thus mentioned is of the mere Japa of the hymn without worshipping. It is impossible to count the benefit if the Japa of the hymn is performed along with worship.

188. Let the accruing of the benefit stand alone. When this Japa is repeated the lord on hearing this stands in the heaven along with the goddess, Uma.

189. Hence after worshipping the lord and in the heaven the devotee shall stand with palms joined in reverence and repeat the hymn.

# CHAPTER THIRTYTWO

# {The rites for achieving worldly benefits}

Upamanyu said:

1. O Krishna, what has been mentioned to you is the site which yields benefit here and hereafter. It is a great synthesis of physical rites, penance, Japas and meditation.

2. Now I shall mention that great rite of worship, Homa, Japa, meditation, penance and charitable gifts, which yields benefits here itself to men who follow Siva.

3. The devotee expert in the meaning of mantras shall at the outset practise mantras since the rites of visible benefits here itself are not fruitful otherwise.

298. This is another instance of the proselytizing attempt of the Puranic Aciryas to entice the laity to their fold.



---


# 4.

A learned and sensible devotee, even after the mantra has been achieved, shall not haphazardly perform any rite the fruit whereof has been thwarted by some unseen powerful obstacle.

# 5.

Atonement is possible for that obstacle. Hence he shall perform that atonement after testing it at the outset by means of omens.

# 6.

He who due to delusion performs the rite yielding the benefit here itself does not attain the fruit thereof and becomes the laughing stock.

# 7.

Without faith and devotion no one shall perform the rite intended to yield direct benefit. He becomes an unbeliever and an unbeliever does not attain fruit.

# 8.

It is not the fault of the lord if the rite does not yield the fruit since it is found to yield fruit here itself for those who perform the rite exactly as ordained.

# 9.

An aspirant who has mastered the mantras overcoming the obstacles and who performs the rite with full confidence and conviction attains the fruit.

# 10.

Or, for the attainment of the benefit let him be scrupulously celibate, eating only the Havisya, milk-pudding or fruits.

# 11.

He shall not even think of, much less physically do, such prohibited actions as violence. He shall be pure always with clear dress and smear the body with Bhasma always.

# 12-17.

After observing the rules of conduct, the devotee shall on an auspicious and favourable day with the characteristics mentioned before, smear the ground with cowdung in a spot bedecked with garlands of flowers and draw the auspicious lotus shining with its own refulgence. It shall be of molten gold with eight petals and filaments, with the pericarp in the middle set with all gems. It shall be not less than a Hasta in width and must have a stalk befitting its size. He shall conceive Anima etc. in the bulbous root made of gold, in accordance with the injunctions. He shall instal the phallic idol with its pedestal, made of gems, gold or crystal with the requisite characteristics. He shall invoke.

the eternal lord accompanied by Amba and the Ganas. Siva’s form as Mahe^vara shall also be conceived in the idol

18-19. It shall have four arms and four faces. It shall be bedecked in all ornaments. It shall wear the tiger’s hide with the smiling face and the gestures of granting boons and of protection to the devotee. Other hands shall hold the deer and the axe. Or if the conceiver desires he can conceive of the Murti as having eight arms.

20. Then the right hand holds the trident, axe, sword and the thunderbolt. The left hands hold the noose, goad, iron club and the serpent.

21. The Murti shall have the lustre of the rising sun. It shall have three eyes in every face. The face towards the east is gentle and has the refulgence befitting its size and features.

22. The southern face resembles the blue cloud and has a terrific appearance. The northern face has the lustre of coral and is bedecked with dark forelocks.

23. The western face is gentle with the lustre of the full moon. Seated on his lap is the great Sakti of MaheSvara

24-25. She is famous as MahalaksmT dark coloured and wholly charming. After conceiving the Murti thus and unifying it into a whole he shall invoke the embodied lord and worship him. For the purpose of ablution he shall arrange for Paficagavya prepared from a tawny cow.

26-27. There shall be Paricamrta and particularly the full seeds. He shall prepare the Mandala ahead decorated with gem-dust. The water-pot of Isana shall be put in the pericarp. The water-pots of Sadyojata shall be placed around, afterwards.

28-30. Eight pots of Vidye^a shall be filled with the waters of holy centres and threads shall be tied round them. Sacred articles of worship shall be dropped therein with due incantations in accordance with the injunctions. They shall be completely covered into the silken cloth with the mantras. When the proper time arrives he shall perform the ablution of the lord with Paficagavya.

Freshly woven cloths of various colours and of fine fabric attractive to the sight shall be offered with songs and instrumental music.

The maximum number of times for Japa is hundred thousand. According to the benefit desired the number of worship varies from one to three.

# 41.

The number of sacrifices is not less than ten for every article and the maximum is hundred. In such rites as Marana and Uccatana Siva shall be conceived terrific in form.

When quiescent or nourishing rites are being performed, Siva shall be thought of as gentle in the phallic image in the Siva-fire and in other idols as well.

In Marana and other rites the Sruk and Sruva shall be made of iron. In all other rites such as quiescent these shall be made of gold.

Still I shall mention about the excellent achievement through the rite.

with mishaps he will be freed from them and become immortal.

# (Rites for deriving benefits hereafter)

Upamanyu said:

1. Now I shall mention the rite for the benefits attainable solely after death. There is nothing like this rite in the three worlds.

2-6. The rite is attended with the excellence of merits. It has been performed by all the gods, particularly by Brahma, Visnu, Rudra, Indra, the guardians of the quarters, the nine planets —sun-god and others, by Visvamitra, Vasistha and other sages who know Brahman, by Sveta, Agastya, Dadhica and others, by us seeking refuge in Siva, by Nandlsvara, Mahakala, Bhrngisa and other Ganesvaras, by the Daityas residing in the nether worlds, by Sesa and other serpents, by Siddhas, Yaksas, Gandharvas, Raksasas, Bhutas, Pisacas and practically by everyone who has attained his respective position. It is by means of this rite that the gods have attained their godhood.

7. Brahma attained his Brahmahood, Visnu his Visnuhood, Rudra his Rudrahood and Indra his Indrahood. It is by means of this rite that Ganesa attained his Ganesahood.

8-10. The linga shall be bathed with white sandal water. Therein Siva and Siva shall be worshipped with

full-blown white lotuses and bowed to. He shall make a lotus-seat very charming and endowed with all characteristics by means of gold-dust and gem-dust in accordance with one’s affluence. In the midst of the filaments a small linga shall be placed. It shall be of the size of the thumb, but charming, auspicious and rendered fragrant with all scents. It shall be placed to the south and worshipped with Bilva leaves.

11-12. To the south he shall apply Aguru. To the west he shall apply red arsenic. To the north he shall apply sandal and to the east he shall apply yellow orpiment. He shall then worship with charming fragrant flowers of various colours.

13. The black Aguru shall be used for incense and fumigation along with Guggulu. Fine cloths bright in colours shall be offered.

14. Milk-pudding mixed with ghee, and lamps with ghee for burning shall be offered. After offering everything with repetitions of mantras he shall circumambulate.

15. After bowing with devotion to the lord of the gods he shall eulogise the lord and crave forgiveness. Naivedya consisting of all offerings shall be offered to the Linga.

16-17. It shall be dedicated to Siva with his mantras. The devotee shall seek refuge in Dak§inamurti. He who performs the worship with the auspicious five scents shall be freed from all sins. He shall be honoured in Siva’s region. This holy Vrata of Siva linga is the most excellent, a great secret.

18. This has been mentioned to you since you are a great devotee. This shall not be given to any one and everyone. It shall be given to devotees of Siva as mentioned by Siva formerly.

# CHAPTER THIRTYFOUR

# ( Delusion of Vi$nu and Brahma)

Upamanyu said:

1. The achievement of benefit that has been mentioned here from the Nitya, Naimittika and Kamya rites can entirely be secured immediately by installing the phallic and the bodily image of Siva.
2. The world is in the form of Linga. Everything is founded on Linga. Hence if the Linga is installed, everything is installed.
3. It is only by resorting to the installation of the Linga that Brahma, Vi?nu, Rudra or other deities maintain their splendour.
4. What more reason can be advanced for the installation of Linga than that Linga of Visvesvara has been installed by Siva too?
5. Hence by all means one shall instal the phallic or the bodily image of Siva for his welfare here and hereafter.

Sri Kr$na said:

What is a Linga? How is lord Siva a Lingin? How did he have the status of a Linga? Why is he worshipped in it?

Upamanyu said:

The unmanifest is called the Linga. It is the source of attributes as well as that wherein the universe merges and dissolves. It has neither beginning nor end. It is the material cause of the universe.
It is the Maya, the Mulaprakrti as extensive as the firmament. This universe including the mobile and immobile beings is born of that.
The universe is of three types: the impure, pure and the pure-impure. From the Linga are born Siva, Mahesa, Rudra, Visnu and Brahma.
The Bhutas with the sense-organs merge into this at the bidding of Siva. He is Lingin since he commands the Linga.



---


# 11-12.

Since the Linga can do nothing by itself without being commanded by Siva, since the dissolution of the universe born of it is only within it, this constitutes the state of being Linga in Siva and not due to any other reason. The Linga is the body of Siva and Siva because it is presided over by them.

# 13.

Hence Siva is worshipped therein for ever along with Siva. The goddess is the pedestal of the Linga and Linga is lord Siva himself.

# 14.

By the worship of Linga alone, Siva and Siva are worshipped. Their having the Linga for their body is not the ultimate reality.

# 15-16.

Since they are pure it is their body only in a secondary sense. That is the great Sakti of Siva the great Atman. Sakti at the behest of Siva gives birth to mobile and immobile beings. One cannot describe the glory of the Linga, even in hundreds of years, by which Brahma and Visnu were deluded at the outset.

# 17-19.

Formerly when the universe was in the state of dissolution, Visnu lying on his couch in the waters went into deep slumber. He lay comfortably asleep. Brahma the grandfather of the worlds casually went there. He saw the lotus-eyed Visnu sleeping undisturbedly. Deluded by the Maya of Siva, Brahma said to Visnu.

# 20-21.

“Who are you? Tell me”. Saying this he hit Visnu angrily and wakened him. Struck by the blow of his hand Visnu woke up in a trice and got up from his bed. He saw Brahma there. Visnu though infuriated within addressed him politely.

# 22-25.

“O dear son, whence have you come? Why are you agitated? Tell me.” On hearing the words of Visnu, indicative of his lordly attitude Brahma felt irritated due to his Rajasic qualities and spoke again. “Why do you address me as ‘dear son’ like a preceptor calling his disciple? Don’t you know that I am the lord? This universe is my creation. After dividing myself into three, I create, protect and annihilate. There is none in the universe who has created me.” When thus addressed Visnu said to Brahma.

# 26-30.

“I am the primordial creator of this universe.

the protector and the annihilator. You too, O sir, were born of me formerly. At my unthwartable bidding you divided yourself into three and began creation. You create the three worlds, protect, dissolve and re-create it. You forget Visnu the lord of the universe free from ailments. You insult even me, your father. It is not your fault. You have been deluded by my Maya. Due to my favour this delusion of yours will disappear ere long. O Brahma, listen to the truth. I am the lord of all gods. I am the creator, sustainer and annihilator. There is no other lord equal to me.

31. A verbal dispute between Brahma and Visnu arose thus. Thereafter a terrible fight ensued causing horripilation.

32-36. Due to Rajasic quality they fought and hit each other with fists. In order to dispel their arrogance and to enlighten them, the wonderful Liriga of the lord appeared in between them. It had thousands of flames. It was incomprehensible and incomparable. It did not increase or decrease. It had no beginning, no middle, no end. Brahma and Visnu were enchanted by thousands of flames. Ceasing from their fight they began to think “What is this?” When they could not understand the reality they attempted to survey its beginning and end.

37. Brahma took the form of a swan with wings all round and went up assiduously with the speed of the mind or wind.

38. Vi$nu, the Atman of the universe, assumed the form of a Boar resembling a mass of collyrium and went downwards.

39. Thus hastening down for a thousand years he did not have even a glimpse of the root of Liiiga.

40. Meanwhile, Brahma too was going up to know his top. But unable to see the end he became exhausted and fell down. Similarly the weary Vi$nu with dejected mind due to the great distress quickly rose up from below.

41. When they met each other again they were completely perplexed and stared at each other with a smile of shame. Deluded by the Maya of Siva they did not know what to do or what not to do.

They stood in front, at the back and on either side of it and bowed. They began to think “Of what nature is this?”

# CHAPTER THIRTYFIVE

(The delusion of Visnu and Brahma)

Upamanyu said:

1. Then there manifested the single-syllabled Brahman in the characteristic way of a word with its sound ‘Om’. It expressed the Brahman.
2. That too was incomprehensible to Brahma and Visnu because their minds had been screened with Rajas and Tamas.
3. Then that syllable divided itself into four, the three Matras A, U, Ma and half the Matra thereafter.
4. The letter ‘a’ attached itself to the southern side of the blazing Linga, the letter “u” to the north and the letter “ma” to its middle.
5. The half a Matra sound was heard on the head of the Linga. Even when the great syllable Pranava was divided, the two gods did not understand the purpose of division. The unmanifest Pranava then underwent the change into the Veda.
6. There the letter “a” became the Rgveda, the letter “u” the Yajurveda, the letter “ma” the Samaveda and the Nada the Atharvaveda.
7. The Rgveda established half of itself succinctly. Thus Brahma possessed of the Rajas, the first among the deities in rites also, the creator of the worlds and the principles as well as the unchanging Atman; Nivrtti in the path of Kala and Sadyojata in the five brahmans, the lower portion in the parts of Linga and the source in the three reasons. It established the sixty-four Gunas and Aisvarya of the cosmic intellect Anima etc. Thus with the ten topics the universe was pervaded by the Rgveda.



---

Sivapur&#x26;ta
11-13. Then the Yajurveda established itself in the ten ways: Sattva among the attributes, Visnu the first among the deities in the rites also, sustenance in the worlds and the firmament, Vidya in the three principles, Pratiṣṭha in the paths of Kala and Vamadeva in the five Brahmans, the parts of Linga and Yoni in the three causes. The Prakṛti was established in accordance with the Aisvarya. Hence the universe is of the form of the Yajurveda.

14-16. Similarly the Samaveda established itself in ten ways. It established Tamas and Rudra the first among the deities in the rites, annihilation in the three worlds and the excellent Siva in the Tattvas, Aghora in the five Brahmans and Vidya among the Kalas, the upper seat in the parts of the Linga and the source in the three causes. So also the Aisvarya of the Purusa. Thus the universe is pervaded by the Saman.

17-20. Then the Atharvaveda established itself thus. It was devoid of Gunas. It placed Mahesvara, Sadasiva as the first among the deities. Though the great Atman, Siva is devoid of activities. It established Sadasiva for the purpose of activities. It created pure blessing whereby the creatures are liberated. Above the worlds, where the words recede along with the mind are the Unmana worlds over which is the divine Somaloka where the lord stays with Uma.

21-22. He who reaches above there in the world does not return. Santi and Santyatita are all-pervasive among the Kalas. Among the five Brahmans it is Purusa and Isana. There is the head of the Linga, the most excellent among the parts, where the sole Niskala Siva shall be invoked and propitiated.

23-33. Among the Tattvas it is the greater Tattva than Bindu, Nada and Sakti. It is greater than the greatest and in reality a non-Tattva. It transcends the three causes. It is beyond Maya the cause of agitation. It is beyond Ananta, the Suddhavidya, Maheśvara, Sadasiva the great lord of all lores. It is beyond the lord who has mantras for his body, who is accompanied by all Saktis, who has five faces and ten arms and who is both Sakala and Niskala. Beyond even that, beyond the Bindu, the half moon, the moon, the

# Vdyaviyasanhkitd

great Nada, the lord of Susumna, the lord of Brahmarandhra beyond that, beyond Sakti and beyond the principle of Siva the great cause there is lord Siva who has no cause. He is the creator of causes, the subject and object of meditation and stationed in the middle of the great sky above the great Atman. Equipped with prosperity and glory he is the lord of all. He has no overlord. He is beyond Aisvarya due to Maya, beyond humanity, beyond the big and small, beyond what is to be discarded, what is not to be discarded, beyond Suddhavidya, Unmana, and the AiSvarya of Unmana. He is great and devoid of beginning, limitless and independent, stable and unsurpassable. Thus with ten such characteristics Atharvaveda is very weighty and so the universe is pervaded by it. 34-42. Rgveda said again— “The state of wakefulness is being mentioned by me whereby I perpetually express the Atmatattva”. Yajurveda said— “The state of dream is being mentioned by me because the Vidya that has transformed of enjoyments be known through itself into objects — is to me.” Samaveda said: “What is called sound slumber is being mentioned wholly by me through Siva that is my meaning and Tamasic in form. Atharvaveda said:--“What is called the fourth stage and what is beyond the fourth is expressed by me.” The three which are of the nature of the path are termed Siva, Vidya, Atman. Their state of three attributes is attainable through the Vedas and shall be purified by him who wishes for Siva’s region. What is called Turiya, beyond the path is the greatest region of salvation. That which is beyond it is the purifier of this path because of its attribute-less state. The Nada is the measurer of both. The end of Nada has me for its Atman. Hence the supreme lord is the chief in view of freedom from my topics. Whatever object is there whether compounded or separated, they call as the meaning of Pranava in view of the association of the Gunas. Therefore, this single-syllabled Brahman is the expression of all meanings.

43. Therefore, at the outset Siva creates the universe saying “Om”. Siva is Pranava and Pranava is Siva.

44-46. That is because there is not much of difference



---


between that which is expressed and the expression. Rudra is devoid of thought. The words along with the mind recede without reaching him. He is that which is expressed by the single-syllabled Om. Letter “a” expresses Brahma, the letter Visnu, the letter “ma” expresses Siva.

47-50. The deity Brahmatman is born of the right limb of Mahesa. Visnu came out of the left. So he is termed Vidya. Nilarudra came out of the heart of Siva and is called Siva. Brahma is the activiser of creation, Visnu the enchanter maintains sustenance. Rudra who controls both is the initiator of annihilation. The three are the causes of the universe. Siva, the source of the three, is the great cause.

51. The Linga stood in between you two in order to enlighten you when you became mutually inimical due to your Rajasic quality and could not understand this meaning.

52-53. Thus they call me “Om”. What was thus mentioned by the Atharva was repeated by the Rgveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and thousands of their Sakhas. Even when the Vedas themselves declared thus clearly through their own mouths it was not comprehended by the two who thought it were a dream.

54. In order to enlighten them and to remove their ignorance the statement of the Vedas was inscribed in the Linga too.

55. On seeing that inscribed in the Linga due to the favour of Siva the deities were pacified and enlightened.

56-61. On realising the mode of evolution and dissolution, the nature of the six pathways and the splendour beyond the Purusa possessing brilliance, the Brahman than whom there is nothing greater, Niskala Siva Isvara, who is the perpetual lord of this universe consisting of Pasu and Pasa who has no fear from any quarter, who is stable without increase or decrease who pervades within and without who has neither inside nor outside, who is unsurpassable, who is different from all the worlds, who is indefinable, incomprehensible, inexpressible, who is essentially in the form of brilliance, who is quite delighted and ever rising, who is the abode of auspiciousness and who is accompanied by a

Vdyaviyasarhhiid 2063

similar Sakti, Brahma and Vi§nu joined the palms in reverence above their heads and spoke thus in fright to the lord. Brahma said:

62. Whether I ignorant or not, lord, I was created by you at the beginning. Whose fault is it that I have been under such a delusion? O

63. Let my ignorance alone, lord, when you are near who can fearlessly talk about his duty or that of others.

64. O lord of gods, our mutual wrangle too is splendidly auspicious since it has yielded us the benefit of paying our homage to the feet of the lord.

Vifnu said: O lord, do not have the power of eulogising you

65. in the manner befitting your greatness. On the other hand if the devotees keep quiet in front of the lord it is merely a transgression of virtue.

66. What is proper to be achieved is the relevant point now. Without knowing anything I have blurted out something for which I pray to be excused.

67. That you were the primordial cause we forgot due to your Maya. I am deluded, puffed up and have hence been chastised by you. O am

68. Of what avail is this submission? lord, I extremely afraid because I have endeavoured to determine your size when in fact you cannot be gauged.

69. O Siva, they call you a great lord, the destroyer of the distress of the frightened. I entreat you to forgive my transgression thus.

70. When thus implored lord Siva became highly delighted. He blessed the two deities and spoke to them smilingly.

— Lord Siva said:

71. Dear Brahma, dear Visnu, you had been deluded by my Maya. You were proud of your lordship and became mutually inimical.

72. You did not cease even when the wrangle turned into an actual fight. Therefore the creative activity of you both, the cause of the universe, was broken in the middle.

73-74. In order to turn you back from your mutual



---


2064 SivapuflkQa dissention arising from ignorance and arrogance and to dispel your delusion and pride I indulged in this sport of manifesting myself in the phallic idol. Hence eschew a recurrence of your dispute and forget the shame. Devoid of mutual rivalry you shall resume your respective duties.

75-77. Formerly at my command the compendiums on knowledge were given to you in order to proclaim your causal nature. The jewel of Mantras consisting of five syllables has been imparted to you. But you forgot all this. I shall give you everything as before together with my behest since without that you cannot create or sustain.

78-80. After telling Visnu and Brahma thus, the lord gave them the principal mantra along with the Jnanasarihita. After obtaining the divine order of the lord, the jewel of Mantra pregnant with meaning, and the Kalas, they prostrated at the feet of the lord. They stood without fear, they were overpowered by joy.

81-83. In the meantime there was a great wonder. As if by magic the Lihga of the god became invisible. Due to the sudden snapping of love they lamented and cried loudly, saying to each other ‘O what a false thing has befallen us, Pondering over the unimaginable prowess of Siva they became free from pain.

84. Becoming great friends once again and embracing each other the leading deities returned to their duties in the universe.

85. Ever since that Indra and other gods, Asuras, sages, men, serpents as well as women instal Lingas in accordance with the injunctions and worship him in the Lihga.

# CHAPTER THIRTYSIX

# ( Installation of Siva)

Sri Krfna said: —

1. O lord, I wish to hear the rules governing the installation of the phallic and the embodied image of Siva.

Upamanyu said:

On a day in the bright half of the month not unfavourable to him, the devotee shall make the Linga of the proper size in the manner prescribed in the Saivite scriptures.
Selecting an auspicious spot he shall test the ground. He shall perform the ten forms of service.
But before the actual performance of this service Vinayaka shall be worshipped. After purifying the spot and other rites he shall take the Linga to the ablution chamber.
With a gold rod dipped into the solution of saffron he shall draw the characteristic signs in the prescribed manner.
He shall purify the Linga along with its axle or nave with a solution of eight or five types of clay as well as with Pancagavya.
After worshipping the Linga along with its pedestal he shall take it to the water-receptacle and keep the Linga immersed in water.
In a well-constructed shed for the immersion of Linga, pure and well-embellished with festoons and screens all round, surrounded by garlands of Darbha grass, an inner shed for the seat shall be arranged in the middle. The seat may be metallic or wooden in the shape of a lotus. On the eight quarters the representations of the eight elephants of the quarters shall be made. Eight pots shall be kept for the eight guardians of the quarters. Eight auspicious things shall be kept ready. The guardians of the quarters shall be duly worshipped. Subhadra, Vibhadra, Sunanda and Vinanda the gatekeepers of the lord shall be worshipped in the four quarters. The Linga shall be bathed and worshipped with the pedestal. It shall be tied with two cloths and bunches of Kusa grass. It shall be brought to the Pitha and laid.

over it immersed in water. The head of the Linga shall be put to the east and the threads shall be put below, the nave to the west of it. The Linga shall be kept in water for one, three or five nights.

15. Thereafter the linga shall be worshipped after due ceremonies as before. After worship it shall be carried along the path of festivities to the place of rest.

16. A resting place shall be made in the middle of the Mandala. After bathing the linga with pure water he shall worship it.

17. A mystical lotus-diagram shall be drawn in the north-east on a spot of ground well-smeared. The water vessel of Siva shall be purified. Siva shall be invoked and worshipped.

18. In the middle of the altar he shall make a diagram of white lotus in accordance with injunctions and to the west of it he shall draw the lotus of Candika.

19. The bed shall be made of silken cloth or other cloth fresh from the loom, before being washed or of flowers or Darbha grass. After making it up he shall put golden flower in it.

20-22. The Linga shall be brought there with the songs and music vocal and instrumental. It shall be wrapped in two red cloths and a bunch of Kusa grass along with the nave and laid down as before. A lotus shall be drawn in front and in its petals he shall place the water-pots of Vidycsa and the vessel VardhanI of Siva. The excellent brahmins shall perform Homa all round the three lotuses.

23-25. Beginning with the east, the eight Murtis shall be placed all round or only the four Murtis Brahma and others in the four quarters. The conductors of the Homa shall possess good mastery of the Vedas. They shall be accompanied by those who can repeat the mantras well. The preceptor shall perform the main Homa either in the north-east or in the west. He shall use all the seven materials in order. The other brahmins shall perform half or one-fourth of the number of sacrifices that the preceptor performs.

26-28. Or the preceptor alone shall perform the main sacrifice. He shall perform the Purnahuti and then



---


another set of hundred and eight Horn as with ghee. He shall place his hand ritualistically on the top of the Linga repeating the basic mantra. After each Homa he shall touch both the Linga and the pedestal. On the whole a hundred or a fifty or twenty five Homas shall be performed with the seven materials of worship. He shall perform the Purnahuti and give Daksina.

29. The priest and the sculptor shall be given half or one-fourth of what the preceptor is given and half of that shall be given to the other brahmins in accordance with one’s capacity.

30-32. Then either an image of the bull made of gold or a bunch of Kusa grass shall be placed in the pit. Brahmasila shall be purified with water and clay, also with Panchagavya, with pure water. It shall be placed in the pit after smearing it with sandal. Repeating the names of the nine Saktis, the rite of Karanyasa shall be performed. Then in accordance with the injunctions prescribed in Saivite scriptures he shall strew the minerals—Haritala and others along with scents, seeds and medicinal herbs.

33-35. The Linga shall be installed on the Brahmasila and dripped in the exudations of trees. To the east and the north the aloe wood shall be placed repeating the basic mantra. Repeating the basic mantra of Sakti the nave shall be joined to the articles of fixation and joining. The place shall be purified. Arghya shall be given and flowers offered. Thereafter the screen shall be drawn all round.

36. The ablution and other rites of the Linga shall be performed in a befitting manner. After taking it away from the place of rest the Kalasas shall be placed in order.

37-39. The great worship begins with the worship of the ten water-jars. In the water inside the Sivakumbha, the thumb and the ring-finger shall be jointly inserted with the Siva mantras. Water thus taken shall be sprinkled. The knower of mantra shall touch the north-east side of the Linga. He shall perform the Nyasas of Sakti, Vidya and Vidyesas in order at the root of the Linga. He shall perform the ablution of the Linga with auspicious water.

40. The nave and the Linga shall be bathed with the



---


# Sivapurdna

Water of Vardhanl and Vidycsa Kalasas. The seats, supports etc. shall be arranged.

# 41.

After performing the Nyasa rite of the five Kalas he shall meditate on the blazing Linga. Facing the east or north with palms joined in reverence he shall invoke Siva and Siva.

# 42-41.

He shall conceive the lord arriving with the goddess, seated on the lordly bull or in an aerial chariot. He shall be conceived as fully bedecked in shining ornaments. He is surrounded on all sides by Brahma, Visnu, MaheSa, sun-god, Indra, other gods and the danavas with their body drenched in the tears of delight with palms joined in reverence above the heads. They are eulogising, dancing and bowing. Then with the five services the worship shall be concluded.

# 45.

There is no further rite after the five reverential services. The installation of idols is wholly identical with that of the Linga.

# 46.

At the rite of Laksanoddhara the eyes shall be shut. The immersion shall be performed with the idols placed prone on the bed.

# 47.

The installation of the idol with the rites for the temple is better than without those rites. If the idols are immersed in the water of the vessel the mantras shall be repeated touching the chest.

# 48-49.

Affluent people shall first build the temple and then perform the installation. If the devotee is not affluent he shall perform the installation of the phallic or the embodied image and shall afterwards build the Siva temple in accordance with his capacity. Now I shall mention the mode of worship at the house and the excellent installation rite.

# 50-53.

The idol shall be small in size but endowed with all traits. In the northern transit of the sun (Jan-July) on an auspicious day in the bright half of the month, the altar shall be made in an auspicious spot. He shall draw the diagram of the lotus in as before. The idol shall be purified with water and clay as before. An auspicious seat shall be kept in the north. Covering the Linga with flowers he shall place it on the seat. Flowers and leaves shall be strewn and

the vessel placed in the middle. Four vessels shall be placed all round. In those five vessels the five Brahmans are ritualistically fixed. After worship Mudras shall be shown and the Rak$a mantra repeated.

54-55. After placing the flower on its top it shall be sprinkled with the water from the Proksani vessel. Again it shall be worshipped along with the proclamation of victory. With the water from the vessels of the four deities from Isana to Vidya he shall bathe the Linga with the basic mantra.

56. The rite of the Nyasa of the five Kalas shall be performed and the worship too as before. The devotee shall worship the lord and the goddess there everyday.

57. Or only one vessel shall be placed with the basic mantra and everything fixed therein. Every other rite shall be performed as before.

58. Too much unclean Linga shall at first be purified and reinstalled. Unclean Lingas shall be sprinkled with holy water. Slightly unclean Lingas too shall be worshipped.

59. Bana Lingas may be installed at will, for they have been already consecrated by Siva himself.

60-61. Such other Lingas may also be installed. In regard to a Svayambhu, a divine or a sage Linga the same is the procedure. If there is no pedestal, a pedestal shall be assigned and the rite of Proksana performed.

62. Burnt, weakened or partially broken Linga shall be thrown in a pond or a river. That which can be joined shall be joined and installed.

63. The lord shall be dismissed ritualistically from the idol that is mutilated, after due worship but retained in the heart.

64. If the worship is in default for one day it shall be doubled, if in default for two days, great worship shall be performed. Samproksana rite shall be performed thereafter.

65. If there is default in worship for about a month, or for more days, some advocate reinstallation. But others say that the Samproksana rite alone is enough.

66-67. Samproksana rite is as follows: —The lord is ritualistically dismissed from the Linga as before, bathed



---


with clay of eight or five types, water, Paficagavya and purified with water from Darbha grass and sprinkled with water from the Proksani vessel, one hundred and eight times with the basic mantra.

68. Holding flowers and Darbha, the hand shall be placed on the top of the Linga five times and the basic mantra shall be repeated hundred and eight times.

69. Beginning from the head and ending with the pedestal, the Linga shall be touched repeating the basic mantra. The great worship shall be performed after invoking the lord as before.

70. If an installed Linga is not available, he shall worship the lord in a place sacred to Siva, or in water, fire, the sun or the sky.

# CHAPTER THIRTYSEVEN

# (The Goal of Toga)

Sri Kr$na said: —

1. Everything mentioned succinctly by your holiness with regard to knowledge, rites and activities, after taking out the essence, has been heard by me. It is as sacred as the Vedas.

2. Now I wish to hear about Yoga which is very difficult to achieve along with its authorisation, ancillaries, injunctions and purpose.

3-4. If death were to overtake before, it can be averted without resorting to the practices of penance, by taking recourse to Yoga whereby the man avoids becoming a self-killer. Hence it behoves you to mention factually the different types of Yoga and their relative importance, cause, time and procedure.

Upamanyu said:

5. O Krfna, the question has been pertinently put by you.



---


# Vdyavlyasartihitd

# 2071

who understand the meaning of all questions. Hence I shall mention everything in order. Listen attentively,

# 6-7.

All other activities are restrained and the mind kept steady in Siva. This is succinctly called Yoga. It is of five types: Mantrayoga, SparSayoga, Bhavayoga, Abhavayoga and Mahayoga which is greater than everything.

# 8.

The concentration of the mind without disturbances, on the expressed meaning of the mantra along with the practice of the mantra is mantrayoga.

# 9.

Coupled with Pranayama the same is called sparsayoga. Without the contact of Mantra, it is Bhavayoga.

# 10.

Wherein the universe with all its parts is meditated upon it is called Abhavayoga since in that the existent object is not seen.

# 11.

Wherein the nature of Siva is contemplated without any conditioning or restricting factor, the concentration of the mind on Siva is called Mahayoga.

# 12.

In this Yoga only he is authorised whose mind is detached from the perceived and Veda-ordained objects of pleasure.

# 13.

The mind is detached only on perceiving the defects in the objects and in the attributes of the lord, perpetually.

# 14-15.

In brief the Yoga is of eight or six ancillaries. The eight ancillaries are Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi as mentioned by the wise.

# 16.

The six Angas are in brief Asana, Pranasamrodha, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi.

# 17-18.

The definitions of all these separately have been mentioned in Siva§astra and other Saivite scriptures, especially KLamika etc. They are mentioned in Yoga€astras and Puranas also. Yama is the observance of restraints such as non-violence, non-stealing, abstention from sexual intercourse and non-acceptance of monetary gifts. The five constitute the subdivisions of Yama.

# 19.

Niyama is the positive curb or restraint with the following five subdivisions—purity, contentment, penance, japa and attentiveness.

# 20.

Asana is the Yogic pose and is of eight types such



---


# SwapwrSna

as Svastika, Padma, Ardhendu, Vlra, Yoga, Prasadhita, Paryanka and Yathe$ta.

# 21.

Prana is the vital breath in the body. Ayama is checking. Hence Pranayama means checking or restraining the breath. It is of three forms—Recaka, Puraka and Kumbhaka.

# 22.

One of the nostrils is pressed with the finger and the air from the belly is let out through the other. This is Recaka (Exhaling).

# 23.

Then through the other nostril the external air is inhaled and the body is filled up like the bellows. It is Puraka (Inhaling).

# 24.

He does not breathe out the internal or breathe in the external air. He remains steady like the filled-up jar. It is called Kumbhaka (Retention).

# 25.

The three, Recaka etc. shall not be done hurriedly or slowly. The practiser of Yoga shall adopt them gradually with restraint.

# 26.

The practice of Recaka shall begin with the purification of the veins and conclude with its voluntary exit as mentioned in the Yoganu£asana.

# 27.

Pranayama is one of the four varieties in view of the time-units, Kanyaka etc.

# 28.

Kanyaka is without Udghata (strokes). Its duration is twelve Matras. Madhyama has two strokes, its duration is twenty-four Matras.

# 29.

Uttama has three strokes and its duration is thirty-six Matras. Uttara is the Pranayama that causes perspiration and trembling of the body.

# 30.

The yogin has experiences the thrill of bliss, horripilation and shedding of tears. He may prattle. There may be vertigo and senselessness.

# 31.

Matra is the unit of time required for the snapping of the fingers after moving them round the knees neither speedily nor slowly.

# 32.

The duration of Pranayama shall be increased in accordance with the Matras and strokes. The veins shall be necessarily purified.

# 33.

The Pranayama is again twofold: Agarbha and



---


# ViyavtyasmhhitS

2073

Sagarbha. Restraining the breath without meditation and Japa is called Agarbha Pranayama. If they too are included it is called Sagarbha.

34. The Sagarbha Pranayama is hundred times more efficacious than the Agarbha. Yogins practise Sagarbha Pranayama.

35-36. The vital breaths of the body can be conquered through the mastery over Prana. The vital breaths are Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana, Naga, Kurma, Kfkara, Devadatta and Dhanaftjaya. That which causes the movement is called Prana.

37. Apana is the vital air that takes the food lower down. Vyana is diffused through the limbs and it develops them.

38. Udana is the vital air that affects the vulnerable points in the body among the limbs. The vital air that spreads equally is called Samana.

39. The vital air Naga is for the activity of belching. Kurma is for the activity of dosing the eyes; the vital air Kfkara is the activity of sneezing and the vital air Devadatta is the activity of yawning.

40. Dhananjaya is the vital air that circulates through the body. It does not leave off even the dead body. Gradually practised, Pranayama is very efficacious.

41. It burns off all defects. It preserves the body of practisers. When the Prana is mastered the symptoms are manifest.

42-44. Urine, phlegm and faeces are reduced in quantity.

The practices of these airs constitute an important feature of £ivayoga too. The present context describes the various processes in regulating the function of vital airs as a part of Sivayoga.

Austerities, expiations, sacrifices, charitable gifts, holy rites do not merit even a sixteenth part of the benefit of Pranayama.

45-47. The total withdrawal of the sense-organs operating in their respective objects is called Pratyahara. The sense-organs are the mind etc. They are capable of according heaven and hell. When restrained they yield heaven, when let loose they are hellish. Hence the intelligent man who seeks happiness shall have recourse to perfect knowledge and detachment, and lift up his soul through his own soul after carefully restraining the horses of his sense-organs.

48-50. In brief, what is called Dharana is the fixation of the mind in a spot. The spot is Siva alone and nothing else. The Dharana shall take place when the mind is established in the spot for a stipulated duration and when it does not swerve from the target. The initial stability of the mind is generated through Dharana. Hence one shall endow the mind with fortitude by the practice of Dharana.

51-56. The root ‘Dhyai’ means to contemplate. Frequent contemplation of Siva with an unconfounded mind is called Dhyana. It is a series of visions in the mind that is fixed on the object of meditation to the exclusion of other visions. Eschewing everything else, Siva, the cause of auspiciousness, the great lord of the gods, shall be meditated upon. Thus concludes the Atharvaveda. Similarly the great goddess Siva shall be meditated upon. In the Vedas Siva and Siva are mentioned as pervading all living beings. In the Smrtis and Sastras they are mentioned as present everywhere and awakened always. They are omniscient. They shall always be meditated upon in different forms. There are two benefits accruing from meditation, the first one being freedom from other visions and the second one the acquisition of Siddhis, Anima etc.

57. The knower of Yoga shall practise Yoga with the knowledge of four things — the meditator, the meditation, the object of meditation and the benefit of meditation.

58. The meditator shall be a man who is endowed with knowledge and detachment, who is faithful, patient, who is free from ego and who is always enthusiastic.

59. A person who is tired of japa shall begin meditation. A person who is tired of meditation shall begin Japa. A person who practises Japa and Dhyana acquires Yoga quickly.

60. Dharana extends upto the twelve-petalled lotus of the heart. Dhyana is the fixation of the Dharana in the twelve-petalled lotus. When Dhyana extends to the twelve-petalled lotus it is called Samadhi.

61. Samadhi is the final state of Yoga. Through Samadhi, the lustre of intellect begins to function.

62. In Samadhi, the vision is steady like the calm ocean, the form vanishes but the vision persists.

63. Fixing the mind in the object of meditation he shall see it steadily. The Yogin thus like the fire extinguished is absorbed in Samadhi.

64. He neither hears nor smells nor prattles nor sees nor feels the touch. The mind does not think.

65. Nor does he identify with anything external. Nor is it bound like the inanimate log of wood. A person whose Atman has thus merged into Siva is called Samadhistha.

66. Just as the lamp in a windless spot never flickers so also is the Yogin who is Samadhistha. An intelligent man shall not swerve. He shall be steady.

67. All his obstacles and hindrances perish gradually if the Yogin practises the excellent Yoga.

# CHAPTER THIRTYEIGHT

# (Obstacles in the path of Yoga)

Upamanyu said: —

1-2. There are ten obstacles in the path of those who practise Yoga:—Idleness, acute ailments, blunder, doubtfulness about the spot, unsteady mind, lack of faith, illusions, miseries, dejectedness and indulgence in sensual objects.



---


# 3.

Idleness affects the body and the mind. Ailments are caused by the imbalance of the Dhatus. They are also due to the defective previous Karmans.

# 4.

Blunder the non-contemplation of the means of Yoga. Doubtfulness is the double perception “this or this?”

# 5.

Unsteadiness is the inability to stabilise the mind. Lack of faith connotes absence of piety in the path of Yoga.

# 6-7.

Illusion is misconception. Misery is of three types. That due to ignorance is spiritual misery. The misery that affects the body due to previous actions is the corporal misery. Thunderbolt, missiles, poisons are the miseries caused by divine intercession.

# 8.

Dejectedness is the agitation due to the frustration of desires. Indulgence in diverse sensual objects is the overfondness for them.

# 9.

When the obstacles subside and the Yogin is absorbed in Yoga the signs begin to appear. They are divine indications of the imminent success.

# 10.

The Upasargas are — Pratibha, Sravana, Varta, Darsana, Asvada and Vedana. They are the Siddhis at the expense of Yoga.

# 11.

The correct perception of objects whether they be subtle, hidden by other objects, or of bygone days, or situated far off, or not yet born is called Pratibha.

# 12.

Sravana is the ability to hear all sounds without any strain. Varta is the knowledge of everything concerning all embodied beings.

# 13.

Darsana is the ability to see all divine objects without difficulty. Similarly, Asvada is the ability to taste divine delicacies.

# 14-15.

Vedana is the ability to know the divine touch and the divine smell. All the lords of the worlds beginning with Brahma stand before him and give him many gems and jewels. Words naturally sweet and eloquent function through his mouth.

# 16.

The divine potions, aphrodisiacs and divine medicines are offered to him by celestial damsels who pay him their homage.

Though this is only a fraction of the Siddhis of

Yoga, when this is done he will have confidence in salvation: “This has been seen by me. In the same manner salvation too shall occur.”

# 18-19.

The Yogic Siddhi pertaining to the earth named cPai£aca Pada consists of eight types of powers, viz., leanness, bulkiness, infancy, old age, youthfulness, the ability to assume different forms and the ability to collect sweet-smelling scents without any earthly part.

# 20-23.

The wonderful Yogic Siddhi pertaining to water consists of sixteen powers, viz: — he can stay under water, he can come out of the earth, at his will he can drink up even the ocean and be none the worse for it, wherever he wishes he can let water spring up or he can hold water in the palm of his hand. Whatever he wishes to eat he can transform into juicy substance, he can assume these forms, he can have the body free from cuts and wounds. Over and above these powers he can have the eight powers of the Yogins.

# 24-25.

The Yogic Siddhi called Taijasa consists of twenty-four types of powers viz: —the ability to create fire from the body, absence of fear of being scorched by the fire, the ability to burn the universe without difficulty, placing of fire in water or in the palms, re-create things burnt in fire, cook food in the mouth, create bodies with the fire and wind and above all these are the sixteen powers of the Apya Yogins.

# 26-28.

The wise know that the Yogic Siddhi called Maruta consists of thirty-two types of powers viz:—the speed of the mind, the ability to enter the bodies of living beings, to hold weighty things like mountains etc. without difficulty, weightiness, weightlessness, holding the wind within the palms, ability to shake even the earth with the tip of the finger, to produce bodies with the wind and apart from these the twenty-four powers of the Taijasa Yogins.

# 29-31.

The Yogic Siddhi called Aindra pertaining to the ether consists of forty powers: —Shadowlessness, absence of the sense-organs, ability to walk over the ether, to have the sense-objects at will, to transgress the ether, to instil the ether into the body, to solidify ether, having no body and

# 32-34.

Ability to acquire whatever is desired, to wander as he pleases, to attack all, to see all the hidden secrets of others, to create bodies according to the task, to bring others under control, to appear pleasing, and to see the world, these powers along with those of the Aindra Yogins constitute the candramasa type of yogin. The powers are mainly mental and the number of powers is fortyeight.

# 35-36.

Ability to cut, to strike, to bind and to release, seizure of all living beings under the influence of worldly existence, ability to delight all, mastery over death and time these are the special powers of the Prajapatya Yogins. These powers along with those of Candramasa Yogins are fiftysix in number.

# 37-39.

Creation by mere conception, protection, and annihilation, ability to exercise authority, to make minds function, dissimilarity with all, creation of a separate universe doing auspicious and inauspicious things— these powers along with the Prajapatya powers, altogether numbering sixtyfour, constitute the powers of the Yogin of the Brahma type.

# 40.

This Aisvarya functions through intellect. The power greater than and beyond this is the Prakrta Aisvarya called Vaishnava. The sustenance of the universe is his alone. Only Brahma can explain that region wholly and not others.

# 41.

Beyond that is the region of Purusa which functions the attributes and then the region of Ganesha and then the region of Isvara. This can be understood by Vishnu a little and cannot be understood by others.

# 42.

All the Siddhis due to knowledge and the Upasargas shall be checked assiduously by means of great detachment.

# 43.

The great Aisvarya that affords protection and is coveted by all cannot be acquired if the mind is attached to false appearances, forms and attributes.

# 44.

Hence he who abandons the attributes and the pleasures of the gods, Asuras and kings, considering them as worthless as blades of grass acquires the greatest Yogic power.

# 2079

45. Or the sage with Yogic powers shall move about with a desire to bless the universe. He can then enjoy the pleasures at his will and attain salvation.

46-52. Now I shall explain the practice of Yoga. Listen attentively. The time and the spot shall be auspicious; it may be the temple of Siva and or other clean place; it shall be a secluded spot devoid of people, creatures, noises and other disturbances. It shall be well-scrubbed and smeared. It shall be rendered fragrant with scents and incense. Flowers shall be strewn. There shall be canopies etc. above. The place shall be abounding in Kusa grass, flowers, sacrificial twigs, water, fruits, roots, etc. It shall not be near fire or water-receptacles. There shall not be too many dry leaves. The place shall not be infested by flies, mosquitoes, serpents and beasts of prey. There shall not be harmful beasts or wicked men instilling terror. It shall not be the cremation ground, monastery, anthill, dilapidated house, meeting-place of highways, banks and shores of rivers and oceans nor should it be the middle of streets. It shall not be a park in disrepair nor a dilapidated cowshed. It shall not be displeasing nor repulsive. It shall not have been defiled by vomited material or undigested foul smell or faeces and urine. The Yogin shall not practise when he has vomiting or when he suffers from diarrhoea, when he has taken too much of food, or when he has exhausted himself. If he is too hungry or too thirsty or too much worried he shall not practise Yoga. If he is engaged in any of the tasks set by his preceptor he shall not practise Yoga.

53-54. He shall have proper food and activity. He shall be sober in recreation and rest. Both his sleep and wakefulness shall be of the normal proper nature. He shall eschew all tiresomeness. The seat shall be soft, pleasant, sufficiently wide, level and pure. He shall practise one of the poses Padmaka, Svastika and others.

55-60. He shall pay homage to all those venerable persons who reside with his preceptors. He shall keep his head and chest erect. The head shall be lifted up a little. The teeth should not gnash one another. The tongue should be kept well within the teeth and motionless. The scrotum

and the penis shall be well guarded by the soles and heels of the feet. The arms shall be placed sideways above the thighs without any strain. The back of the right hand shall be kept over the left palm. The back shall be gradually straightened and the chest shall be projected forward. The eyes shall be fixed at the tip of the nose. He shall not look at any other quarter. The vital breath shall be retained. He shall be as motionless as a stone. He shall meditate on Siva along with the goddess within his own body, in the seat of the lotus of his heart. He shall worship by meditational sacrifice.

# 61-63.

He shall remember the lord at the root or tip of the nose, or in the umbilicus, or neck, or in the palate or the gullet or in the middle of the eyebrows or at the nostrils or in the forehead or on the head. After conceiving a suitable seat to Siva and Siva he shall remember Siva with or without Avarana in the two-petalled, or twelve-petalled lotus in accordance with injunction. Or it may be in the ten-petalled six-cornered or four-cornered lotus.

# 64-66.

The lotus shall be conceived in the middle of the eye-brows as having two petals and as brilliant as lightning. To the south and north of the lotus in the middle of the eyebrow two leaves shall be conceived with the colour of lightning ending with letters. The leaves of the sixteen-petalled lotus are the sixteen vowels. They shall be conceived beginning from the petal to the east and proceeding in order.

# 67-69.

The twelve letters beginning with ‘Ka’ and ending with ‘Tha’ are the leaves. The lotus of the colour of the sun, which is meditated inside the heart and which is of the colour of the cow’s milk has ten letters from “Da” to “Pha” for its petals. The letters up to the letter “La” (i.e Ba, Bha, Ma, Ya, Ra and La) constitute the six petals of the lotus with petals facing down and having the colour of the smokeless burning coal. The letters from “Va” to “Sa” constitute the petals of the lotus at the Muladhara, having the colour of gold.

# 70.

He shall meditate on the lord and the goddess in any of these lotuses according to his taste. The mind shall be steady.

Vdyavtyasaihhitd

71-73. He shall conceive him in any of the following forms — of the size of the thumb, pure, brilliant and illuminating all round, of the form of pure lamp, endowed with its Sakti completely, of the size of the digit of the moon, of the form of the star, the awn of Nivara grain and the stalk of the lotus, of the circular shape of the Kadamba, of the form of the dewdrop. He shall contemplate on him as the lord of different Tattvas of the earth and others of which the meditator wishes the mastery.

74-75. The Murtis beginning with Brahma and ending with Sada£iva, the eight Murtis beginning with Bhava, the gross Murtis of Siva prescribed in the Saivite scriptures, the terrible, the quiet or the mixture of both shall be meditated upon by the sages without the desire for fruits, and by the experts in meditation.

76-78. If the terrible forms of the lord are meditated upon they shall dispel sins and ailments. If the mixtures of the form are contemplated upon, the effect is often delayed. If the calm and the gentle form is contemplated upon, the effect is neither immediate nor delayed. But the special benefit in the gentle form is salvation, peace and intellect. The Siddhis are achieved gradually. There is no doubt about this.

# CHAPTER THIRTYNINE

# (The Saivite Toga)

Upamanyu said:

1. Some Yogins perform meditation with the full conviction that Siddhis are immediately acquired by those who remember the lord.

2. In order to steady the mind some perform meditation on the gross form. The mind that is fixed on the gross form becomes stable in the subtle form.

3. When Siva is directly meditated upon, Siddhis are achieved. Even when the other forms are meditated upon the devotee shall think of the form of Siva also.



---


# 4.

He shall observe the steadiness of the mind and frequently meditate. This meditation, they say, has at the outset a specific object. Thereafter it becomes devoid of any specific object.

# 5.

Philosophers say that there is no Nirvisaya meditation. They hold that a series of intellectual vision is called meditation.

# 6-9.

But the intellectual vision by itself without an object shall also function. Therefore the fact is — the Savisaya meditation is on the lord who is conceived as brilliant as the sun. The meditation on the subtle form is Nirvisaya. Savisaya meditation has a definite form in view. Meditation of the formless is the Nirvisaya meditation. The two are called Nirbija and Sablja also. Hence the practiser shall at the outset perform the Savisaya or Sablja meditation and in the end perform Nirbija or Nirvisaya meditation.

# 10-13.

The benefits derived from Pranayama are San ti, Prasanti, Dipti and Prasada. When adversities subside it is called Siinti. Prasanti is the destruction of ignorance both external and internal. The external and internal illumination is called Dipti. The normal and the healthy state of the intellect is called Prasada. When the intellect is in healthy normal state the internal and external sense-organs too acquire healthy and normal state.

# 14-18.

The meditator shall perform meditation after realising the four: viz. the meditator, meditation, the object of meditation and the benefits of meditation. The meditator as defined by good men shall be richly endowed with knowledge and detachment. His mind shall never be excited. He shall have faith and his Atman shall remain delighted. The root Dhyai means to contemplate. Frequent contemplation on Siva with even a little practice of Yoga shall quell sins of the person who meditates on the lord with faith and unexcited mind.

# 19.

The object of meditation on the form of intellectual visions is Dhyeya and that is Siva himself accompanied by Siva.

# 20.

The experience of salvation and the perfect Anima etc. is the direct fruit of meditation on Siva.



---


# 21.

Man shall eschew everything and be engaged in meditation since he will be having both happiness and salvation from the practice of meditation.

# 22.

Knowledge cannot be attained without meditation. A non-yogin cannot have meditation. The ocean of worldly existence is crossed by the person who has both meditation and knowledge.

# 23.

The clear and single-centred knowledge devoid of all conditioning factors can be achieved only by a Yogin who regularly practises Yoga.

# 24.

The minds of only those whose sins have been entirely quelled become inclined towards knowledge and meditation. Those whose intellects have been defiled by sins find it wholly inaccessible.

# 25.

Just as the blazing fire burns both the dry and the wet twigs, so also the fire of meditation burns in a trice both the auspicious and the inauspicious Karmans.

# 26.

Just as even a modicum of light dispels darkness so also even the slightest practice of Yoga destroys great sins.

# 27.

There is no limit to the benefits acquired by one who meditates on the lord with faith even for a moment.

# 28.

No holy centre is so efficacious as meditation; no penance, no sacrifice is equal to it. Hence one shall perform meditation strenuously.

# 29.

Yogins do not resort to holy centres full of waters nor to deities made of stone or clay because they have belief only in their Atmans.

# 30.

Just as the gross form of the lord fashioned out of clay or wood is observed by the non-yogins so also his subtle form can be perceived by the Yogins.

# 31.

Just as in the Royal household, the interior officials not the workers outside are the favourites of kings so also those who are engaged in inner meditation are the favourites of lord Siva and not those who perform holy rites.

# 32.

Just as the exterior workers do not enjoy the pleasures in the royal palace, the same is the case with the Karmins.

# 33.

If a person in his attempt for knowledge and

Yoga were to die in the middle he shall go to Rudraloka even due to his mere endeavour for yoga.

34. He enjoys happiness here and is reborn in the family of a Yogin. Attaining knowledge and Yoga or the path of knowledge he transcends the worldly existence.

35. Even by performing sacrifices, that goal is not obtained which a man with the desire for the knowledge of Yoga attains.

36. The fruit derivable by worshipping a crore of brahmins can be attained by giving alms alone to a Siva Yogin.

37. By giving cooked rice to him the benefits of sacrifices, Agnihotras, charitable gifts and pilgrimages can be secured.

38. Those who disparage Sivayogins under delusion undergo sufferings in hells along with those who listen, till the dissolution of the world.

39-42. Only when there is some listener, does a person disparage the Yogin. Hence the listener too is a sinner. Those who worship Sivayogins attain pleasures here and salvation hereafter. Hence, Sivayogins shall be honoured and revered by those who seek worldly pleasures, giving them asylum, food stuffs and drinks, beds and blankets. The Yogic virtue cannot be smashed by the iron clubs of sins. It is very strong and shall be considered to possess adamantine fibres. Yogins are not smeared by sins like the lotus leaf not affected by water.

43. Even the land where the sage engaged in Sivayoga resides is hallowed and sacred, let alone Sivayogin himself.

44. Hence a shrewd and efficient man shall eschew all activities and practise Sivayoga in order to quell miseries.

45. A Yogin who has achieved the fruits of Yoga may sport about after enjoying the pleasures as he wishes or shall remain here performing the requisite services.

46. Or let him consider worldly pleasures worthless and eschew them. Due to detachment let him abandon rites and be liberated.



---


# 47.

Or seeing evil portents and realising death as imminent the Yogin engaged in the practice of Yoga shall resort to a Saivite holy centre or temple.

# 48.

If he has courage enough he shall abandon his life there voluntarily even without ailments.

# 49-50.

He who voluntarily forsakes his life as prescribed in Saivite scriptures, by observing fast, or by consigning his body to Siva-fire, or by plunging into Saivite holy rivers, shall immediately be liberated.

# 51.

Even if he is afflicted by ailments and dies after resorting to Saivite holy centres he shall be liberated.

# 52.

Since voluntary death by means of fasts etc. is sought with a mind full of confidence and devotion, they say that this death is commendable.

# 53.

After killing a person engaged in disparaging Siva or being afflicted himself, if a devotee eschews his life, not ordinarily possible to forsake, he is not reborn.

# 54.

He who dies after fighting being incapable of killing a disparager of Siva shall be liberated with the members of his family for twenty-one generations.

# 55.

No man treading the path of salvation is equal to one who eschews his life for Siva or for a devotee of Siva.

# 56-57.

Hence his liberation from the worldly sphere becomes speedier. If a Sivayogin dies after resorting to one of the means cited before or after attaining the purity of the six pathways, obsequies shall not be performed as they are done for the layman.

# 58-60.

His descendants shall not observe post-mortem pollution. His body shall be buried under ground or burnt in fire, or cast off in Saivite holy waters or left abandoned like a log of wood or a clod of clay. Or if at all some post-mortem holy rite has to be performed let it be some auspicious rite. The descendant shall propitiate devotees. Only a devotee.

^03. As detailed in the purnnas, the regions sacred to Siva (Siva-ksetras) are spread over the vast expanse of Indian territory. The Puranas place these in all directions, mostly on the rivers, sea-coasts, forests or hills.

# CHAPTER FORTY

# (Journey of the sages of Naimiṣa)

Suta said: —

1. After explaining to the sages, who honoured and exalted him, the path of knowledge that had been previously imparted by the sage Upamanyu of restrained senses to Sri Kṛṣṇa, Vayu vanished in the air at sunset.
2. The next day in the morning the sages of Naimiṣa set out to perform the holy rite of ablution at the end of their Sattra.
3. Then at the behest of Brahma the delighted goddess Sarasvati herself flowed as an auspicious river of sweet water.
4. On seeing her the sages were delighted in their minds. They concluded the Sattra they had begun and plunged into the river.
5. After performing the rite of Tarpana to the gods with her auspicious waters they remembered the previous events and went to Varanasi.
6. There they saw the holy river Ganga descending from the Himālayan ridges and flowing to the south. They took their bath there and went along the bank.
7. After reaching Varanasi they rejoiced much. They plunged into the north-flowing waters of the Ganga. They visited Avimuktesvara and worshipped it. They were about to start when they saw a brilliant splendour in the sky that resembled a crore of suns. Its spreading lustre pervaded all the quarters.

Avimukteivara, the celebrated phallic emblem of Siva, is placed in the My city of Varanasi.

# Vayaviyasartihitd

10. Then the Siddhas and sages who had performed Paiupata rites with their bodies covered with Bhasma came there in hundreds and merged into that splendour.

11. When those noble saints merged in it, the splendour suddenly vanished. It was highly mysterious.

12. On seeing that great mystery the sages from Naimi$a could not know what it was. They went to the forest Brahmavana.306

13-15. Even before they arrived there, the wind-god, the purifier of the Worlds, had mentioned to Brahma the creator of the worlds and the source of the Vedas how he visited the sages of Naimisa, what he talked to them, how they were inclined to Siva, his attendants and Siva and how they had concluded their Sattra of long duration. When permitted by Brahma, the wind-god left for his own city.

16-17. Brahma was comfortably seated in his abode acting as an umpire when Tumburu and Narada had their mutual rivalry in regard to their musical performance. He was taking a keen interest in their performance while Gandharvas and Apsaras waited on him.

18. That being inopportune time the sages were stopped at the threshold by the gate-keepers and they sat outside the palace of Brahma towards a side.

19-21. Narada was pronounced equal to Tumburu in musical skill. Permitted by Brahma to act in collaboration with him he eschewed mutual rivalry and quarrel and contracted friendship with Tumburu. With him and the other Gandharvas and Apsaras, he started from the palace of Brahma like the sun coming out of the clouds, in order to sing and play on his Vina before lord NakuliSvara.

22. On seeing Narada the sages bowed to him and asked him whether that time was suitable to see the lord.

23. Saying "Yes, this is the proper time, come this way in”, the gatekeeper went away in hurry on another mission.

305. Not identified.

306. Tumburu is well known as the first-rate musician among the Gandharvas.



---


24. The gatekeepers intimated to Brahma and the party entered the abode.

25. After entering, the party prostrated to the lord from distance. Or being permitted by Brahma, the party stood there respectfully.

26-30. The lotus-seated lord enquired after their health and said, “I have had your news from Vayu. But tell me when the wind-god had vanished how did you proceed?” Thereupon the sages related everything: — their journey to Varanasi after their sacrificial ablution, their visiting the LiAgas, their worship of Avimukte£vara, the appearance of the mass of splendour in the sky, the merging of the sages therein, the disappearance of the splendour and their desire to understand the reality thereof. All this they submitted to Brahma with reverence.

31-32. On hearing what was mentioned by the sages the four-faced creator of the universe shook his head and spoke in a majestic tone; “A great Siddhi in the next world awaits you all.”

33. The lord has been propitiated by you through the protracted Sattra. The fact that the lord is delighted has been indicated.

34. The refulgence in the air seen by you in Varanasi is the splendour of Mahesvara Linga.

35. The sages who were merged therein are those who had performed the Pasupata rites in accordance with the Vedic injunctions. They have become liberated. Their sins have been washed in view of their stable piety.

36. Just as they achieved salvation by means of Pasupata rite, so also, ere long, you too will achieve liberation. This fact is indicated by the splendour seen by you.

37. Fortunately your time has come up now. You go to the southern summit of Meru resorted to by the gods.

38. There my son the sage Sanatkumara is waiting for Nandin, the lord of the Bhutas.

39-40. Formerly, on seeing Lord Siva, Sanatkumara did not pay homage due to his ignorance or arrogance of being a Yogin or carelessness or lack of humility. Due to this offence Nandin was infuriated and he made him a camel.



---


VtyaviyasarhhiUi 2089

41-42. I bewailed this for a long time. I worshipped the lord and the goddess and craved forgiveness. With great difficulty I atoned for his wickedness. Sanatkumara was restored to his previous form.

43-45. Lord Siva smiled and spoke to the chief of Ganas. This sage was arrogant and he insulted me. Hence O sinless one, explain my true nature to him. The eldest son of Brahma who took me for a fool is given to you as your disciple. He will be the protagonist of my knowledge. He will perform your coronation as the presiding deity of virtue.

46. Thus addressed, the leader of the Bhutas was pleased to accept the behest.

47. Sanatkumara is performing penance on the Meru at my behest for the propitiation of the Gana.

48. He shall be seen by you all before the lord of the Ganas meets him. Ere long, Nandin will come there to delight him.

# 4. The steps that lead to it consist of blue stones and are beautiful. People can ascend and descend comfortably. Through these the lake brightens all the eight quarters.

# 5-8. The sons of sages take water and flowers from it for the worship of the deities. They wear white sacred threads, white loin-cloth and bark garments. Some get into it for taking bath. Some come up from it after taking bath. Some have matted hair. Some have tufts. Some have shaven heads. They are embellished with Tripurujras. Some have grave or helpless or smiling faces. They have various vessels Ghafas, Kalasas, Kamandalus, Karakas or lotus-cups for taking water.

# 9-11. Some stand on rocks submerged in water as if avoiding contact with the low-born people. They observe good conduct and their bodies are grey with Bhasma. They plunge into the water here and there. On the rock are seen the remnants of worship —gingelly seeds, raw rice-grains, flowers, Darbhas, Pavitras. These indicate that the brahmins who come here for bath perform worship and Tarpanas to the gods, sages and the manes.

# 12-14. At places people perform worship on dry banks after performing Arghya to the sun as indicated by the scattered oblations and flowers. At places leaders of elephant herds are merging in and emerging out of water. At places the deer, the hind and the horses have come to quench thirst. At places peacocks and elephants are drinking water. At places oxen and hostile bulls are butting against the banks.

# 15-17. In some places the sound of the Karandava is heard. In some places there is the chirping sound of the Sarasa. In some places the ruddy goose cackles. In some places the bees hum. The lake appears to be holding a loving conversation perpetually with the birds and animals living on the trees and taking bath therein or drinking its water. Through the cooing sound of the cuckoos lying hidden on the trees on its banks it appears to invite all those who are oppressed by the sun.

18-20. On the northern bank of the lake under the Kalpa tree, on a platform of adamantine rock, the sages from Naimiṣa saw Sanatkumara seated on a soft deer-skin. He had just woken up from his trance. He was being worshipped by the sages and the leading Yogins. On seeing him they bowed to him and stood in reverence.

21. On being asked they told him the purpose of their visit. The tumultuous sound of Dundubhi was heard in the heaven immediately.

22-25. At the same time an aerial chariot brilliant as the sun was visible. All round, it was surrounded by leading Ganas, numerous and countless. It was thronged by the celestial damsels and surrounded by Rudra girls. Sounds of Mṛdaṅga, lute and flute were heard. It had canopies set with gems of various colours. It shone with strings of pearls. It was encircled by sages, Siddhas, Gandharvas, Yakṣas, Caranas, Kinnaras dancing, or playing on instruments. A banner marked by the sign of a heroic bull was fluttering from a post set with corals. The aerial chariot had a gabled front.

26-33. In the middle of the aerial chariot the son of Brahma accompanied by the sages saw the son of Silada seated in a divine throne with Suyaṣa, brilliant as the goddess Lakṣmī. On either side there was a chowrie. He sat under a royal umbrella with a gemset handle, resembling the pure moon. He had three eyes. Even by his gestures he reminded one of the lord. He appeared like the untransgressable behest of the creator. He was one who blessed all. He stood directly in front of Siva. He held an excellent trident. As the commander of the Ganas he looked like another Viśveśvara. He could curb and bless the rulers of the universe. He had four arms, a splendid body embellished with the digit of the moon. A serpent adorned his neck and the moon his head. He was the embodied form of Aiśvarya. He appeared like active efficiency. It seemed that the very salvation or the omniscient lord had come there. On seeing him the son of Brahma was highly delighted. He stood up with palms joined in reverence. He seemed to dedicate himself to him.

34-36. In the meantime when the aerial chariot reached

Sivapurana
the ground, Sanatkumara prostrated. After eulogising him he informed him of the arrival of the sages “These are the sages of six families who had performed the Sattra of long duration in Naimisa. At the bidding of Brahma they have come here to have a sight of you, lord. On hearing these words of the son of Brahma, Nandin cut off their Pasas by his mere glance immediately. He imparted to them the Saivite virtue and the perfect knowledge of Siva Yoga. Then he returned to the lord.

37. Everything was imparted by Sanatkumara to Vyasa direct preceptor who imparted the same to me and now I succinctly mention this to you.

38. This excellent gem of Sivapurana should not be mentioned to those who do not know the Vedas, nor should it be imparted to a disciple who is not a devotee of Siva nor to an atheist. If it is imparted to these out of delusion it yields hell.

39. If it is imparted, accepted, read or heard along the stipulated path accompanied by service yields happiness, the three aims of life—Dharma, Artha, and Kama and in the end, liberation invariably.

40. You and I have helped each other through this path. I have realised my desire. I shall go now. Let everything be auspicious to you always.

41. Then Suta blessed them and left. The righteous sages fixed their abode permanently at the outskirts of Varanasi after performing the sattra at Prayaga when they perceived that everything was being defiled by the advent of the Kali age.

42. Then the sages performed the Pasupata rites with the desire to get released from the bondage. They attained enlightenment. They learnt modes of Samadhi and achieved the greatest Bliss.

43. This wholesome Sivapurana is concluded now. It shall be read and heard assiduously.

44. It shall not be mentioned to an atheist nor to one lacking in faith nor to a stubborn rogue nor to one who is not a devotee of Siva nor to a religious hypocrite.

45. On hearing this once, the sins are reduced to ashes. A non-devotee attains devotion and a devotee attains more devotion.

46. If it is heard again a further devotion is achieved. If it is heard again salvation is the result. Therefore it shall be heard over and again by those who desire salvation.

47. If one aims at some big benefit one shall read or hear this Purana five times with a pious mind. He is sure to achieve the desired result.

48. K$atriyas of yore, excellent brahmins and Vaisyas repeated it seven times and attained the vision of Siva.

49. If a man with devotion hears it, he enjoys all pleasures here and secures liberation hereafter.

50. Sivapurana is a great favourite of Siva. It yields worldly pleasures and liberation. It increases devotion and it is on a par with the Vedas.

51. May Siva with his Ganas, sons and blessings upon those who explain or listen to this Purana.
