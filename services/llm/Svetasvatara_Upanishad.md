# SVETASVATAROPANISAD

Students of Brahman (i.e: the Vedas) discuss (among themselves) What is the cause ? 1

(Is it) Brahman ? Whence ? are we born ? Why do we live ? Where is our final rest ? Under whose orders are we, who know the Brahman, subjected to the law of happiness and misery ?

(NOTES_The Upanisad begins with an account of a discussion carried on by some students of the Veda with regard to the ultimate problems of philosophy and religion.

1. Cause_The first doubt deals with the problem of causation. It analyses itself as follows: What is the nature of causation? Is it necessary that everything should have a cause? If so, what is the final cause of this universe? Can it be Brahman? How can the Absolute Brahman, unrelated to anything else—the one without a second—be the cause of anything? If at all it could be the cause, what is the nature of this causal Brahman? Is it the material cause, or the efficient cause, or both? Or, can it be that some other non-spiritual entity such as time, nature, etc., is the first cause, and not Brahman? All these seem to be condensed in the first question raised.
2. Whence are we born?_The next question is with regard to the mystery of creation: Why should the universe come into existence, if at all it is a thing created? How can the imperfect come out of the perfect, the finite out of the infinite? If it is not created, why should it appear to be an effect, and why should

# CHAPTER ONE

everything in this universe seem under the necessity of having an origin? If man in his real nature is Brahman Itself, why should there be so much variety in this world? Why should Brahman forsake Its supreme bliss and take on this individual aspect? This seems to be the purport of the second doubt:

# 3. Why do we live?

The third doubt is with regard to the mystery of life itself: The origin of life, its purpose, its relation to the rest of the universe and allied questions are implied in it:

# Where is our final rest?

The fourth doubt deals with the mystery of death. The fate of the individual after death—whether he is annihilated, reborn or absorbed in Brahman—is a matter of deep interest to the religious mind:

# 5. Under whose orders etc.

The last doubt deals with the problem of evil: Why should there be suffering in this world? If man is free and is master of himself, would he willingly choose the life of suffering? How can the existence of suffering under a merciful Providence be explained? Are there proper methods of escape from this, and if so, why does not man have recourse to these methods and be free—especially those who know these methods from a study of the scriptures?

The next Mantra points out briefly the nature of Manana (reflection by the Neti, Neti method, or the process of elimination).

The self also is not a free agent; being under the sway of happiness and misery.

# NOTES

The various possible explanations for the riddle of the universe are here considered one by one, and rejected as unsatisfactory. To explain a riddle is to relate it to something which we already know through the law of causation. A cause is something which must invariably and immediately precede the effect: To explain the universe, therefore; is to find out something which must necessarily and immediately precede it, and a knowledge of which is essential before we can understand the universe. The various possible explanations offered cannot bear scrutiny, as we shall see.

---

# CHAPTER ONE

First let us take time. The fact that things are born and exist in time may make it a plausible explanation of the world. There are however serious objections to this. Time is but a part of the framework of thought itself, and without thought it cannot exist; Thought itself is a part of the universe whose explanation we seek: Therefore to consider time as an explanation of the universe will amount to reducing the former into an explanation of itself: It would be the same thing as to say that the cause of time is time itself, which is no explanation: Again, time, though it appears to be eternal, always changes from the past through the present to the future, and it would seem to consist of innumerable moments which come into existence and die away just as any other object we can conceive of. It will also be seen on self-analysis that the cognizing self always precedes the cognition of time: So time cannot be considered as the first cause which brought the universe into existence. The word atmabhava gives the three reasons explained above as to why time cannot be considered as a cause. These are oneness with the universe, subjection to birth, and existence of the self prior to it.

Next with regard to nature. Nature may here be taken in the sense of inherent property, or as representing the vast expanse of spacial objectivity. Nothing can come into existence if it were against its nature to be born. So the presence of nature may be considered a necessary antecedent to the birth of the universe, and as such, nature may be taken as its cause. Again, nothing can exist, or come into birth, or be conceived of, except as an object in space: Therefore spacial objectivity, being a necessary and inevitable antecedent,

---


# 14 SVETAs VATAROPANISAD

may plausibly be considered as a cause of the universe. But we find on scrutiny that in either case, nature cannot be considered a cause for the very same reasons as are condensed in the aphoristic expression atma-bhavat: 'Thus an inherent property can at best exist only in some object, and apart from the object it cannot have separate existence as a cause. Spacial objectivity, again, like time, is one of the frameworks of thought itself, and cannot exist as an antecedent to thought. So in either case nature cannot be considered as a cause of the universe of which it is a part: The existence of the cognizing self is again necessary for knowing nature. For this reason also nature cannot be the cause. Moreover to say that the cause of the universe is its own nature is virtually to confess our ignorance of its true origin: with regard law. The universe next to is not a chaos but a cosmos. Everything seems to be related to everything else, and the whole seems to be well arranged, co-ordinated and organized into a system, each object having its definite place and function in respect of the whole, and each being subject to a particular kind of behaviour. Law is nothing but an intellectual formulation of this uniformity of behaviour of objects under particular circumstances: This uniformity may be supposed to be due to some controlling force from outside, which must necessarily exist beforehand. It is on this supposition that law is brought in as a plausible cause. But really law, being only an expression of the behaviour of objects, cannot exist apart from the universe and independent of the cognizing mind.



---

# CHAPTER ONE

Next with regard to chance: Science tells us only about the why, and not the how, of things. Thus the science of botany traces the various stages, and analyses the diverse agencies at work, in the development of a seed into a tree, but it cannot say why those agencies work in a particular way alone, and why the seed grows into a tree and not an animal: We may push back our explanation further and further, but there is a limit to all such explanations, and we shall be forced to admit finally that we do not know the why of things: It is then that we have to take refuge in the explanation that it is due to accident or chance. If, however, we look at it a little closer, we find that the explanation means nothing more nor less than the denial of the universal law of causation. Along with time and space, causation forms a framework of thought itself. Therefore to deny it will be tantamount to denying thought itself: Intellectually, therefore, it is impossible to conceive of anything as due to chance: It will be simply a confession of our ignorance:

Next comes matter; The whole universe may be conceived of as a combination of irreducible particles of matter called atoms, as scientists used to do till recently. But as even these admittedly form part of the universe that we are trying to explain, and as they require the presence of the cognizing subject for their very existence, they cannot be properly considered as cause of the universe.

Next as regards energy. Even in a materialistic view of the universe the inert atoms have to be brought into union by force or energy, which may, on that account, be spoken of as the cause of the universe: Or,

---


# 16 SVETASVATAROPANISAD

As modern scientists say, the ultimate particles of matter may themselves be units of energy. Therefore it may be proper to consider energy as the source of all matter. A little thought, however, will show that even this energy cannot be the cause of the universe, because, like everything else, energy itself is part of the universe which we seek to explain, and cannot exist apart from the cognizing self.

Next comes intelligence. In the ultimate analysis, the whole universe consists of cognizing minds, cognized objects, and cognition, the bond between the two. This is the Triputi of Vedanta: The cognizing intelligence must be present in every thought, although the objective world may or may not be cognized. In the act of introspection, the cognizing subject does not feel or know the existence of anything external to itself. It converts itself, as it were, into an object for the purpose of observing itself. The cognizing subject is also present in sleep when the whole of the objective universe seems to have vanished: This perceiving intelligence, therefore, has better claims to be considered as the cause of the universe than the entities mentioned before. But on closer scrutiny we find the perceiving subject is as much part of the universe as the perceived object, as both cannot exist apart from each other. We thus see the necessity for the self itself to take the form of an object of observation in introspection. As part of the universe, this perceiving subject also, like the perceived object, vanishes in deep sleep and Samadhi, and only pure consciousness remains. Thus intelligence cannot be the first cause:

Next, as regards the self, the self must remain in Samadhi as well as in deep sleep, although even



---

# CHAPTER ONE

intelligence vanishes The consciousness of having enjoyed sound sleep, and of the non-awareness of the existence of the world at the time of deep sleep bear evidence to this fact: The self must have existed in deep sleep, as it could not otherwise have had memory of these experiences after awakening: We cannot also be sure otherwise whether the awakened self is the same as the One that had gone to sleep: This individual self, which must thus be presumed to exist in all the three states of waking, dream and sleep as the knower, the enjoyer and the doer, may be supposed to be the ultimate principle on which the explanation of the universe depends: But even this individual self seems to be not free. If it were free, it would have always continued to enjoy and not to suffer, as nobody likes suffering: The very fact that it has to come back to the dream world or to the waking world, which is full of happiness and misery, shows that there is some agent which is keeping it under its subjection.

We thus see that the explanations offered by the intellect, on the basis of reason, are not satisfying to the cause-seeking intellect itself: The Ultimate Truth has to be realized in the depths of Samadhi, and only then intellect and reason may be of use to us in comprehending the truth of our experience: That is the province of reason. Meditation is, therefore, the most important method for realization, and hence it is this process and its results that form the topic of the next Mantra.

# NOTES

1. Who is the God of religion etc = The word devatmasakti is an aphoristic expression which is variously interpreted by various commentators,

---

# CHAPTER ONE

but to us it seems to embody the following view. The word deva represents the God of Religion, Atma the Self of philosophy, and sakti the Energy of Science. The word also means the self-conscious power which is in everyone, Deva meaning self-luminous: It thus means to emphasize the presence of the Ultimate Truth in everybody in the form of self-conscious power. Devatmasakti also means the source of knowledge, emotions and will, the three aspects of mind, Deva standing for knowledge; Atma for the emotions, and Sakti for will. This gives the characteristics of the Ultimate Reality which is beyond the province of mind and language: the individual soul.

# 2. Who presides over

the word adhitisthati (presides over) the Sruti wants to make clear that all the other causes mentioned before as possible explanation depend for their very existence on this fundamental principle, and cannot function independently of it. The other so-called causes are only the instruments of this principle: It is to be noted that the Sruti calls this principle not as causing the universe, but as presiding over everything. This is to indicate that the question of causation, with which the Upanisad begins, arises only at the intellectual stage of thought and enquiry; it ceases to crop up when the state of unity is realized in Samadhi.

# 3 Had been incomprehensible etc.

The word svagupa may here refer to Sattva, Rajas and Tamas—the constituent elements of Nature according to Sabkya philosophy. It may also mean the apparent limitations that the Supreme Reality assumes by itself, or better still, the limitations of the intellect in the spiritual.

---


# 20 SVETAs VATAROPANISAD

aspirant who has been trying to find out the Reality. This last meaning is preferrable, because the Sruti wants to emphasize that the obstruction to spiritual realization lies within ourselves, and that as soon as this is removed by meditation the Spirit reveals Itself.

This universe is nothing but the Ultimate Principle as it appears to our intellect: The next two Mantras give a description of this phenomenal universe.

# CHAPTER ONE

manifold; and which each revolution gives rise to two.

[NOTEs_This abstruse Mantra is Saikhya in terminology, and uses a highly technical imagery. It conveys the sense that; to one bound by the intellect and the senses, the universe is explainable only as an expression of the Supreme Being. Hence God is meditated upon as the wheel of this universe. The universe itself is compared to a wheel in order to indicate its dynamic nature, its perpetual motion. It also alludes to the cyclic nature of all worldly processes - the movement of heavenly bodies, the rounds of birth and death, the succession of involution and evolution, the repetitive process of history, the alternation of happiness and misery, etc:

1. One felly - The circumference of the wheel represents Nature, known variously as unmanifested ether, Maya, Prakrti, Sakti, Ajuana, etc. It is the cause on which the whole creation depends.
2. Triple tyre - The three tyres represent the three qualities of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, or it may be taken as representing time, space and causation, or the Triputi of Vedanta.
3. Sixteen extremities - These represent the Sixteen products or Vikrtis of the Sankhya philosophy. They are the eleven organs (Indriyas) and the five gross elements (Paicabhitas): They are called extremities because creation becomes complete with their evolution.
4. Fifty spokes - These consist of (a) the five Viparyayas or misconceptions, (b) the twenty-eight Asaktis

# 22 SVETAs VATAROPANISAD

Or disabilities, (c) the nine Tustis Or satisfactions, and (d) the eight Siddhis or perfections: More information on this may be found in Sarkhyasutra III, 37, 45, and Sankhyakarika 47 et seqq.; in Yogasutra I, 8 and II, 2; and in the Brahmapurana.

# 5. Twenty counter-spokes

These are the wedges to strengthen the spokes, and they refer to the ten senses and their ten objects; eight--Astagas.

# 6. Six sets

Six sets, each consisting of eight entities, are commonly enumerated as follows:

1. Eightfold Nature (Prakrtyastaka) consisting of the five elements and mind (Manas), intellect (Buddhi) and egoism (Ahankara);
2. Eight ingredients of the body (Dhatvastaka) consisting of external skin (Carma), internal skin (Tvak), blood (Asrk), flesh (Mamsa), fat (Medas), bone (Asthi), marrow (Majja), and semen (Sukra);
3. Eight psychic powers (Aisvaryastaka) like Anima, Mahima, etc.;
4. Eight mental states (Bhavastaka), consisting of righteousness (Dharma) and unrighteousness (Adharma), knowledge (Jiana) and ignorance (Ajiana), renunciation (Vairagya), and attachment (Avairagya), super-human powers (Aisvarya) and want of super-human powers (Anais varya);
5. Eight super-human beings (Devastaka) like Brahma, Prajapati, Devas, Gandbarvas, Yakeas, Rakgasas, Pitrs and Pisacas;
6. The eight virtues of the soul (Gupastaka) consisting of compassion (Daya), forbearance (Kgama), absence of jealousy (Anasuya), purity (Sauca), freedom from fatigue (Anayasa), freedom from poverty (Akarpagya) and desirelessness (Asprha).

# 7. Three different roads

These are virtue (Dharma), vice (Adharma), and knowledge (Jfana).

# CHAPTER ONE

8 Belt__It is Kama or desire, which is said to be manifold on account of the differences in the objects of desire:

9 Each revolution _The corresponding word moha in the text literally means delusion, and is synonymous with Bhrama. In its application to the wheel, Moha can, however, mean only revolution: This revolution represents delusion, which gives rise to the two opposites, namely, merit and sin, or happiness and misery.

# S'VETASVATAROPANISAD

has the five Pranas for the waves, the mind the basis of five-fold perception for the source, and the five-fold misery for its rapids; and that has five whirlpools, five branches and innumerable aspects:

[NOTEs_The points of resemblance between the river and the universe, which make the metaphor suggestive and significant, are as follows

1. as the river; water comes from the sea and goes back to the sea, the universe springs from God and goes back to Him.
2. As the river is full of potential dangers to the unthinking masses living on its banks on account of possible floods, so is the world capable of mischief to men absorbed in it; but, then, just as the river contributes to the prosperity and convenience of people who make use of it for irrigation and communication, the world also helps the spiritual evolution of those who have the right outlook on it.
3. The waters of the river always change but yet keep a unity because of the banks; so also the universe is full of change, but it keeps up an appearance of unity within the limits of its banks of time and space situated in the bed of causation.
4. As the waters of the river are not different from the ocean, the universe is not different from God in the absolute sense.

1. Five streams - These represent the five senses.

2. Five causes - These are the five elements, or Paicabhutas.

3. Mind - The expression indicates that the universe is dependent on the mind, and that if it is transcended in Samadhi, the universe disappears:



---

# CHAPTER ONE

4. Five-fold misery - It consists of the sorrows of pre-natal existence in the womb, those attendant on birth, the miseries of old age, the pains of diseases and the sorrows of death.

5. Five whirlpools - The objects of the five senses of sound, touch, colour, taste and smell, in which individual souls generally get drowned:

waif in which everything lives, akard in which everything rests in the infinite, Hiva in the wheel of Brahman; the pilgrim soul is whirled about. The individual soul, hitherto regarded as separate, is the moving force or God; knowing, blessed or favoured by Him, it attains immortality.

In this infinite wheel of Brahman, in which everything lives and rests, the pilgrim soul is whirled about; knowing the individual soul, hitherto regarded as separate, to be itself the Moving Force, and blessed by Him, it attains immortality.

# NOTES

1. Wheel of Brahman - The reference here is to the wheel described in Mantra 4. The wheel is the universe.

---


# 26 SVETAsVATAROPANISAD

2. Pilgrim soul - The word Harsa, which literally means swan in classical Sanskrit; is here interpreted to mean traveller or pilgrim. The progress of consciousness from Tamas to Sattva, or from the unconsciousness of inert substance to the super-consciousness of Samadhi, is compared to a pilgrimage: There seems also to be a subtle reference to the similarity of the soul to a swan kept in a revolving cage, fluttering about so as to escape from its confinement:

3. Is whirled about - The reference is to the theory of reincarnation. etc. - The

4. Individual soul line is variously interpreted by commentators of various schools of thought, each trying to find in it a support for his own favourite system of Vedanta: It is referred to many times in the commentary on the Vedantasutras. The Advaitic commentator takes the line to be connected with the previous part of the Mantra and interprets it to mean, "Thinking that the individual soul is different from God:" According to him this conception of the difference between the individual soul and the Supreme Soul is the real cause of bondage and reincarnation. According to the Advaitic interpretation, the line has to be construed thus: Atmanam jivam preritaram ca isvaram prthag eva matva bhramyate: Theists take this line as related to the last line of the Mantra. According to them it means that the realization of the Atman as separate from its Lord and Master gives immortality. They, therefore, would construe it thus: Atmanam preritaram ca prthag matva amrtatvan etc: Even taking this line as referring to the last line of the Mantra, others interpret the line to mean, Knowing the individual self to be the same as



---

# CHAPTER ONE

God and treat it as referring to the cause of liberation: We may attempt to reconcile these views, which are generally supposed to be in opposition, as follows. The ignorant man is usually concerned only with himself and the world. To him God, the third entity, does not exist: The intelligent man soon finds out, however, that there is some unknown power behind the universe, which is guiding his destinies. The first part of spiritual practice, therefore, is to realize the existence of this power on whom both he and the world depend. At first this realization is only intellectual. In the history of humanity, as well as in the life of the individual, we find that the idea of God comes early in the picture: With the maturing of intellectual powers comes the real search as to the fundamental character of this power. Sadhana (spiritual practice) first begins with a separation of God from the universe, as a being with qualities entirely different from the individual and the world: Subsequently, with the analysis of the individual and the world psychologically and scientifically, the various systems of philosophy, dealing with the relations between God, the individual and the world, come into being. Each system represents a stage in the progress of thought and Sadhana. In the final stage of realization, in the depths of Samadhi, the world and the individual soul, as we know them, vanish entirely, and God alone remains. The individual soul gradually acquires all the fundamental characteristics of God, and gives up all the characteristics of the world: This process of transformation of the individual soul is referred to in this line. This transformation involves both the processes, namely, first finding out the difference between God and the individual soul, as we know it, and

---


# 28 SVETASVATAROPANISAD

Secondly, the identification of God with the individual soul, as it really is. The two being part of the same process; there is no real conflict between them.

5. Blessed The blessing of God, according to Advaitic interpretation, is the realization of the oneness of Jiva and Brahman; The theists construe it as referring to the doctrine of grace.

There is no real conflict between the two views, as the Lord's grace is necessary for the realization of identity. A greater difficulty is as to how to reconcile the doctrine of grace with the doctrine of Karma or self-effort. Here also the difficulty can be overcome if we understand that the grace of God is bestowed on a person only after he has reached the limits of self-effort.

How to get absorbed in Brahman is described in the next Mantra:

---

# CHAPTER ONE

This is expressly declared to be the Supreme Brahman. In that is the triad: It is the firm support, and it is the imperishable: Knowing the inner essence of this, the knowers of Veda become devoted to Brahman, merge themselves in It, and are released from birth:

# NOTES

1. This: The word may refer to the visible universe inclusive of individual souls, or to the Ultimate Reality behind it experienced in Samadhi as the Self of ourselves: In the former case, the first line would mean "This universe is expressly declared (by the Vedas) to be the Supreme Brahman." In the latter case, it means, "The Absolute (experienced in Samadhi) is what is expressly declared (in the Vedas) as the Supreme Brahman." According to the Advaitic explanation, the line means that the Supreme Brahman described in the Vedas is above the world of cause and effect.
2. Triad: The expression signifies the world of multiplicity, which is conceived as different series of three like time, space and causation; waking, dream and sleep, etc. The world of multiplicity may be said to exist in Brahman either in reality as the theists would have it, or by way of superimposition as the Advaitins would prefer.
3. firm support: The passage may mean any three of the following: Either the Absolute is the substratum of all manifested appearances or it is the one support, which always saves everything from a fall or the whole universe rests in It after dissolution.

---

SVETAsVATAROPANISAD

4. Inner essence: The reference is to the Taittiriya passage which describes how the knowers of the Veda realize the inner essence of this universe by progressing step by step from the gross body through the subtle and causal bodies.

Bound together are the perishable and imperishable, manifest and unmanifest; and this universe the Lord supports. Without the Lord, the self is bound because of being the enjoyer; knowing Him, the self is released from all fetters.

The Lord supports this universe, which consists of a combination of the perishable and the imperishable, the manifest and the unmanifest. As long as the self does not know the Lord, it gets attached to worldly pleasures and is bound; but when it knows Him, all fetters fall away from it.

NOTES: 1. Combination etc.--Refers to the subtle and gross aspects, cause and effect, spirit and matter, into which everything in the world may be divided.

The conscious subject and the unconscious object, the master and the dependent, are both unborn. She too, who is engaged in bringing about the relation of the enjoyer and the enjoyed (or between these two), is unborn: When all these three are realized as Brahman, the self becomes infinite, universal and free from the sense of agentship:

NOTES: This Mantra deals with the Triputi or the three elements of thought ~the subject, the object and the relation between the two. These three are said to be unborn, because nobody knows when and how they

came to be. The conscious subject is described as the master because it exists independent of the object in deep sleep, while the object is considered to be dependent because it cannot exist independent of the perceiving subject: The second line refers to how the subject and object are brought into relation by the inscrutable power of Maya, which invests them with the character of the enjoyer and the enjoyed, and thus gives rise to all kinds of sufferings: This reminds us of Yogasutras, II. 17 and 23, where junction of the subject and the object is described as the cause of avoidable misery. It is in deep Samadhi that this relation is finally severed, and all the three merge themselves into one in Brahman, and the Atman, which till then was known to be finite, active and different from the universe, realizes its natural infinitude, universality and freedom from the sense of agentship.

Matter is perishable, but God is imperishable and immortal: He, the only God, rules over the perishable matter and individual souls. By meditating on him, by uniting with Him, and by becoming one with Him, there is cessation of all illusion in the end.

Notes: The last two lines point out the various stages by which the Absolute is reached: The expression by union refers to Savikalpa or Samprajiata Samadhi, in which there is yet difference between the person meditating and the object meditated on, and the phrase by becoming one with him to the Nirvikalpa or Asamprajiata Samadhi, in which even this distinction is obliterated in the consciousness of identity.

This1 is to be known as eternally existing in one's own self: Indeed, there2 is nothing to be known beyond this. As a result of meditation, the enjoyer, the enjoyed and the power which brings about the enjoyment—all are declared to be three aspects of Brahman:

# NOTES

1. This is to be known etc: The state attained by the knower of Brahman, which is described in the previous Mantra, is natural to one, and exists in oneself even before realization; only one is not conscious of it on account of one's limitations. So meditation should be on the eternal Truth existing in one's own self, and should not be on anything which is separate from it. Nothing can be known etc.

2. There is nothing to be known etc: This line refers to the fact that, when consciousness of unity is reached, knowledge cannot proceed further, as all science attempts only to find out the unity behind diversity.

(The state of the Atman before and after realization) is like that of fire (before and after percussion). By meditating on the Pranava, the Atman is perceived manifestly in the body, (but it was there in a latent state even before realization).

[NoTES__The Mantra introduces an illustration to convince, even a Jayman, of the eternal existence in himself of the glory of Atman, which he subsequently realizes as a result of meditation. The act of percussion, which brings out the latent fire, stands for spiritual practices which reveal the Atman within. Here spiritual practice is identified with meditation on Pranava or the sound symbol Om ' .]

As oil in sesame seeds, as butter in curds, as water in underground springs, as fire in wood, even so this Self is perceived in the Self.

He who, by means of truthfulness, self-control and concentration, looks again and again for this Self, which is all-pervading like butter contained in milk, and which is rooted in self-knowledge and meditation, he becomes that Supreme Brahman, the destroyer of ignorance.

# NOTES

All the four similes have distinct shades of suggestiveness. The first suggests that the Atman is present everywhere just as oil pervades the whole of the sesame seed; the second implies that the Impersonal Atman, though all-pervading, assumes the form of Personal God under the influence of Bhakti, like butter contained in milk; the third conveys the idea that the bliss of Atman relieves us of all suffering, even as a man digging for water is relieved of his trouble when the water level is reached. Primarily, they all alike convey by implication the idea of the immanence of God:

1. Self - It stands for Buddhi (intellect):

# 40 SVETAS'VATAROPANISAD

Yoga, and in its application to the knowledge of Brahman: These Mantras are often taken as authority to show that meditation and self-culture are as old as the Vedas. The present Mantra alludes to the preliminary steps in the process of spiritual practice:

1. Harnessing the mind and the senses--this refers to the preliminary process of attaining purity of mind by a life of self-control in accordance with the rules of righteousness:
2. Light of the fire - Fire and light are both symbolic: Fire refers to the ordinary waking intellect conscious of external objects, and light refers to Pure Consciousness: To find out the light of fire is to understand that Pure Consciousness is separate from the ordinary consciousness of the intellect: This part of the Mantra alludes to the capacity to discriminate between truth and untruth, the first of the four qualifications demanded of the spiritual aspirant according to the Advaita system.
3. Evolving soul - The word 'Savita;' ordinarily meaning one who brings forth or inspires and usually taken as a synonym of sun, is used here symbolically to denote the Antaryamin or the Ultimate Principle conceived intellectually as the source of all creation, and as working constantly and eternally in the hearts of all beings to raise them to higher and higher levels of life, and thereby causing the process of evolution from behind the scene:
4. Earth - The expression is used symbolically to denote matter in general. Brought itself out of the earth therefore means extracted itself out of all attachment to the pleasures of the world. This refers to the spirit of renunciation, the second of the four qualifications demanded of spiritual aspirants.

Controlling the heaven-aspiring senses with the help of the mind2 and the intellect; the Immanent3 Soul regenerates them as to enable them to manifest the self-luminous Infinite Light:

# NOTES

1. Heaven-aspiring: The reference here is to the natural tendency of the senses to run after external worldly pleasures, heaven indicating only pleasure arising out of the enjoyment of external objects through attachment.
2. Mind and intellect: Senses are by nature attracted to their objects. No external method is ultimately of any avail in checking their natural propensities. The mind and the Buddhi (intellect), which control the senses, have to be purified and transformed by a changed outlook on life. Then alone can sense-control be successfully practised.
3. Immanent Soul: The word in the original is Savitr. For detailed explanation vide Note 3 on the first Mantra of this Chapter. All evolution is to be traced ultimately to the working of the Divinity within.

Following only in the footsteps of the wise, merge you both in the ancient Brahman by continued meditation. May the Glorious One manifest Himself! May the sons of Immortal Bliss hearken to me—even they who occupy celestial regions!

# NOTES

This Mantra speaks of Nirvikalpa Samadhi in which the spiritual aspirant gains complete absorption in Brahman. The Rsi, who has realized that blessed state, is exhorting others to tread the path leading to it—even those occupying celestial regions whose bliss is insignificant compared with that of this highest absorption. Those who are priding in their worldly prosperity are shown that there is something higher for them to gain—their birthright of Immortal Bliss.

1. Both—The mind and the intellect, whose limitations were hitherto acting as a screen hiding the vision of the Ultimate Truth.
2. Sons of Immortal Bliss—All men are referred to by this expression, thus indicating that the attainment of Divinity is the birthright of all.

---

# CHAPTER TWO

Where fire is churned out, where air is controlled, where Soma juice overflows, there the mind attains perfection:

NOTES—This Mantra aims at a synthesis of Jnana-yoga, Rajayoga and Karmayoga, and utilizes them all for the realization of the Ultimate Truth.

1. Fire—In Vedic symbology fire stands for intellectual knowledge in the form of ideas couched in language. This knowledge is said to be churned out, like fire from fire-sticks, as a result of study and reflection and philosophical enquiry under the guidance of a competent teacher. Of the two pieces of wood used for lighting fire for sacrificial purposes, the upper one stands for the teacher and the lower one for the disciple, and the process of study is spoken of as churning out. The whole line refers to Jnana-yoga in general.
2. Air—This represents Pranayama or the control of the vital functions, which is associated with Rajayoga. Hence this line refers to the practice of that Yoga.
3. Soma Juice—The Soma juice used in Vedic sacrifice symbolizes the exhilaration arising out of the pursuit of worldly enjoyments, and giving rise to the forgetfulness of one's higher nature and birthright of eternal bliss. Soma is said to overflow when the physical character of the Vedic sacrifice is transcended, and ritual gives place to self-sacrifice; and when work becomes unattached, and is elevated to the rank of worship and service of God in man. This line therefore stands for Karmayoga or the Yoga of active self-sacrifice.

Attaining whom thou destroyest the source and art no more troubled by the results of past actions to that ancient Brahman be thou devoted through the Prime Cause, the Immanent Soul:

# NOTES

This Mantra refers to Bhaktiyoga for completing the picture of synthesis of Yogas referred to in the previous Mantra. It refers to the mind which gives rise.

1. Source - Here, this is finally destroyed only when the Absolute Brahman is realized and the aspirant becomes one with It.
2. Result of past actions - The word Purta means charitable acts, and is generally used in conjunction with the word Ieta, which denotes ritualistic sacrifice. These stand for all meritorious actions leading to heaven. Here it refers to the accumulated results of all past actions in general. The virtuous actions are specially referred to for showing that even they lead to rebirth.

and should be transcended before attaining final release from the cycle of births and deaths, by becoming one with the Absolute:

3. Through the Prime Cause—The Absolute is beyond thought and speech, and cannot be the object of devotion: Devotion moreover requires the duality of Bhakta (devotee) and Bhagavan (the Divine). We have therefore to approach the unity of Absolute through some perfect form conceived by the intellect: The best possible form of devotion is that towards the Immanent Soul conceived as the First Cause, whose presence is felt by all devotees in their hearts.

# NOTES

1. Drawing the senses etc. - Refers to the practice of Pratyahara or abstraction of the mind. It is the process of checking the out-going tendencies of the mind and senses, and turning the mind back upon itself.
2. Knowing one - He who knows the meaning of Pranava (Om) and the practice of meditation on it;
3. Fearful currents - Tendencies of the mind caused by ignorance, which drag one to the ocean of births and deaths (Sansara).
4. Raft of Brahman - The Taraka-Brahman or Pranava. This refers to the practice of silent repetition (Japa) of Om in combination with meditation on its meaning.

# CHAPTER TWO

Controlling the senses with an effort, and regulating the activities in the body, one should breathe out through the nostrils when the vital activities become gentle: Then the knowing one, without being in the least distracted, should keep his hold on the mind as on the reins attached to restive horses.

# NOTES

1. Controlling the senses with an effort - Refers to the practice of Yama or moral virtues consisting of non-injury, non-stealing, continence, truthfulness, non-acceptance of gifts, etc. The practice of these guards the aspirant from the influence of evil tendencies acquired in the past.
2. Regulating etc - This refers to Niyama or practice meant to direct the tendencies and activities of the mind towards worthy objects: This practice is more positive than negative: It consists of such observances as purity, contentment, austerity, scriptural study, devotion to God, etc.
3. Breathe Out etc - Refers to Pranayama or breath control as elaborated in the Yogic scriptures: It does not consist of merely breathing out (Recaka), but also of breathing in (Puraka) and holding the breath for some time, both inside and outside (Kumbhaka). This should be attempted only after fair progress is made in the preliminaries of Yama and Niyama, and a fair control of the psycho-physical activities is already attained; otherwise it is dangerous. Moreover, it should be practiced only under the guidance of a competent Guru.

# 4.5

Where the floor is even, free from pebbles, fire and dust, and free from disturbing noises and dampness, it is helpful for concentration of mind. One should perform one's exercises in mind control.

One should perform one's exercises in concentration, resorting to caves and such other pure places helpful to its practice - places where the ground is level without pebbles, and the scenery pleasing to the eyes; where there is no wind, dust, fire, dampness and disturbing noises.

# Notes

The passage describes the various conditions that are to be observed, if Yoga is to be practised successfully and safely. A pure place is one which fulfils the hygienic conditions, and has also holy associations. It is difficult to sit in a place for long and in comfort, if it is not level, or is full of pebbles and dust.

# CHAPTER TWO

dampness, fire and smoke that invariably accompanies fire; make the air impure, and thus render Pranayama dangerous: A pleasing scenery helps one to compose the mind, while noise and strong wind disturb the mind practising concentration:

Forms that appear like snow, smoke, sun, wind, fire, fire-fly, lightning, crystal and moon, precede the manifestation of Brahman in Yoga practice:

Notes: If these forms gradually manifest themselves during Yoga practice, one can be sure that the manifestation of Brahman is not very far off. These represent the various stages of the mental modifications as one progresses towards the ultimate realization.

When the fivefold perception of Yoga, arising from (concentrating the mind on) earth, water, light, air and ether, have appeared to the Yogin, then he has become possessed of a body made of the fire of Yoga, and he will not be touched by disease, old age or death.

[NOTES_The Yogin understands that his physical body is a combination of the five elements, and that his real self is separate from them, and that as such he is not affected by disease, old age or death, which are inseparable from all material things that are by nature always subject to change: He throws off his physical body into the fire of Yoga, and takes Up, as it were, a new individuality purer than the previous: His physical body itself, he knows, does not change its essential character as matter, whatever changes it may undergo: Matter remains indestructible, so also the soul which is separate from it:

# CHAPTER TWO

1. Five-fold perception of Yoga etc.--The reference seems to be to the Yoga practice, mentioned also in Patanjali's Yoga-sutra, I. 35, of steadying the mind through fixing attention on One of the five senses of smell, taste, colour, touch and sound: This is done by concentrating on the tip of the nose, the tip of the tongue, the fore-part of the palate, the middle of the tongue and the root of the tongue, respectively.

It is said that the first signs of entering Yoga are lightness of body, health, thirstlessness of mind, clearness of complexion, a beautiful voice; an agreeable odour and scantiness of excretions.

---

# CHAPTER TWO

When the Yogin realizes the truth of Brahman, through the perception of the truth of Atman in this body as a self-luminous entity, then, knowing the Divinity as unborn, eternal and free from all the modifications of Prakrti, he is freed from all sins.

NOTES: This Mantra identifies the pure Spirit (Atman) in man with the Spirit at the back of the universe, denoted by the words Brahman and God, and emphasizes that this true knowledge of the nature of God and His affinity with the soul of man constitutes perfection in Yoga.

This Mantra is also remarkable for the simultaneous use of three important Vedantic terms: Atman, Brahman, and Deva. Atman means Spirit in the embodied state; Brahman interpreted as unrelated to the universe, is Spirit in transcendence, the Impersonal Absolute of philosophy. Interpreted, however, in relation to the universe, the word means the Personal God of religion, i.e., the Spirit behind the universe: Deva, here translated as the Divinity, clearly implies Divine Personality, and is the same as Brahman as Personal God. In Vedantic literature, the meanings of these terms, though definite, often imperceptibly shade off into one another. Although this leads to confusion sometimes, it is really one of the most charming features of Vedantic thought, and is responsible for making it the highest mysticism and philosophy in one.

[NOTES_This Mantra speaks of the oneness of the Ultimate Principle in spite of its apparent diversity in functions: It also shows how the Divine Lord or God is nothing but this Ultimate Principle (the Absolute), appearing as active in creation, maintenance and destruction of the universe by virtue of the power of Maya. This Maya, again, is shown to belong to Him: He is the master of it, and is not affected by it, just as a cobra is not affected by its own poison. All the forces that we see active in the universe are nothing but the manifestations of His Maya, and as such these forces can work only at His will and pleasure;]

He who protects and controls the worlds by His own powers, He Rudra is indeed one only. There is no one beside Him who can make Him the second: O men, He is present inside the hearts of all beings: After projecting and maintaining all the worlds, He finally withdraws them into Himself.

NOTES: Rudra—This word is a synonym of Siva in later Purana literature, but no such sectarian meaning is intended here. The word is used in its literal sense: The root meaning of the word is the destroyer of the sins and sorrows of devotees as well as the bestower of Jnana and bliss on them. Rudra also means the punisher of those who break His laws, physical, moral and spiritual. The word seems to be used here to hint that God as the Indwelling Self watches the deeds of men, good as well as bad.

Though God, the creator of heaven and earth, is one only, yet He is the real owner of all the eyes, faces, hands and feet in this universe. It is He who inspires1 them all to do their respective duties in accordance with the knowledge2 of the various beings (with whom they appear to be associated).

[NoTES_1, Inspires: As the Indwelling Self, it is God who really guides creatures in the use of all their senses. The exact meaning of the word dhamati is to fan a fire into flame. It is used here metaphorically for kindling fire in the senses, i.e., to enlighten and inspire them. It shows how dependent we are on His grace for every one of our achievements:

2. Knowledge, past actions etc. - This the symbolic sense of the word bahubhyam according to the commentator Narayana: According to Mahidhara, the two hands refer to Dharma and Adharma. These form, as it were, the two hands by means of which the senses are worked. It symbolically describes how the work of the senses in this life is dependent upon the knowledge and habits acquired by the individuals in past lives. It also implies that the grace of God works only on the basis of man's self-effort: Thus it reconciles the conflict between divine grace and human responsibility.

3. Tendencies - The word patatra literally means wings or bellows for blowing fire; but here it is used metaphorically for Vasanas or tendencies, as noted by

1. Holdest in Thy hand - This shows that the Lord is ever ready to reveal Himself unto His devotees, if they repeat, and contemplate OD, the Prapava and Mahavakyas.
2. Do not destroy etc - Shows that the devotee likes to meditate on the personal aspects of God even after the realization of the formless Absolute:

Higher than this Personal Brahman is the infinite Supreme Brahman, who is concealed in all beings according to their bodies, and who, though remaining single, envelops the whole universe. Knowing Him to be the Lord, one becomes immortal:

Mantra therefore leads the aspirant from the Personal to the Impersonal. But coming as it does immediately after one invoking the blessing of the Deity as the Personal, the Mantra seems to imply that the realization of the Impersonal Absolute can be had only through the maturity of devotion to the Personal and the grace He bestows on the devotee. The Personal and the Impersonal are not two different beings, but the same Deity in His two aspects: It must also be remembered that even after the realization of the Absolute, there is nothing contradictory in retaining devotion to the Personal God.

# CHAPTER THREE

beyond all relations. The idea is that God is both transcendent and immanent: This beautiful synthesis of the conceptions of the Personal and the Impersonal, of the Transcendent and the Immanent, is a characteristic feature of this Upanigad.

1. Therefore - Because He is formless, all-pervading, etc - He can take any form, and be present anywhere and everywhere, according to the wish of the devotee.
2. Benevolent - If He did not graciously dwell in the hearts of all beings, and guide their senses, thoughts and actions, it would not have been possible for man to realize Him, by his own unaided effort.
3. Makes use of etc. - To bring about the evolution of the souls, and ultimately bring them to the goal of liberation (Mukti).

This Self is indeed the mighty Lord; He is the imperishable (internal) light that controls everything. He guides the intellect of all beings so as to enable them to gain that extremely pure state (of Mukti).

Those who realize this become immortal.

Assuming a form of the size of a thumb, by virtue of intellect, emotion, imagination, and will, the Infinite Being dwells in the hearts of creatures as their inner self. Those who realize this become immortal.

# Notes

1. Size of a thumb - Denotes the size of the heart where the Atman is to be meditated upon and realized. The Atman is not really reduced to a limited size but only appears to be so.
2. By virtue of intellect etc. - For explanation of the passage, see notes on IV, 17.

gaq; the Infinite Being Gcarraf has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feet: He exists beyond ten fingers.

That Infinite Being has a thousand heads, a thousand eyes and a thousand feet enveloping the whole universe on all sides: He exists beyond ten fingers.

# NOTES

Thousand heads etc. The reference to thousand heads, eyes and feet indicates that He is the real thinker, witness and worker behind individual brains, eyes and organs of action, respectively.

Ten fingers - The expression has several interpretations: We give here two of them which seem best (a) He exists in the heart which is ten fingers beyond, i.e., above the navel. The idea is that though He, the manifester of the cosmos, is so great, yet He is immanent in all, and resides in the heart, i.e., in the self of man. (b) Though He has manifested Himself as the cosmos, He exists beyond it by ten fingers, i.e., He transcends it. Thus in the first part of the Mantra, Divine immanence is emphasized, and in the second, divine transcendence.

# Svetasvatara Upanishad

Even though Ma in the form of the objective universe grows beyond His true nature, (a: He) That which is, that which was, and that which is yet to be—all this is nothing but this Infinite Being: Though He grows beyond His own nature into the form of the objective universe, He still remains the lord of immortality.

# Notes

1. Grows beyond etc: Appears to have form and qualities, which are opposed to His real nature as Infinite Existence, Knowledge and Bliss.
2. Objective universe: The word anna means food. In the technical language of the Vedas it stands for the universe, which is the object of enjoyment for the one Eternal Subject.
3. Still remains the lord of immortality: The idea is that though the Supreme Being manifests Himself as the universe, yet His perfection and infinity are not in any way affected by it: It is for giving a logical interpretation of this mystic truth that theories like Sarkara's doctrine of apparent transformation, and Ramanuja's doctrine drawing a distinction between the body of God and His Self, and limiting change to the body alone, have been formulated.

# NOTES

1. Colourless The simile of a ray of light, which, though colourless in itself, assumes different colours when it passes through a prism, seems to be suggested here to show how the formless can assume forms:

That Itself is Agni (fire) That is the sun, That is the air, That is the moon, That is also the starry firmament, That is the Brahman (Hiranyagarbha), That is the waters, That is Prajapati,

That Itself is the fire, That is the sun, That is the air, That is the moon, That is also the starry firmament, That is the Brahman, That is the waters, That is Prajapati,

# NOTES

This Mantra is very important; it shows that the various gods that we meet with in the Vedas, such as Agni (fire), Aditya (sun) and the rest represent the same Being; therefore there is no reason to consider that the Vedic religion advocates the worship of different gods. The Mantra occurs in the Samhita portion also.



---

# CHAPTER FOUR

It is also noteworthy how here as well as in other places the Upanisad interposes both masculine and neuter pronouns to indicate the Supreme Being. A comparative study of the previous Mantra, the present one and the next will provide a striking example of this. It shows how these Upanisadic thinkers were deeply imbued with the idea that the Supreme Being is both Personal and Impersonal:

Thou art the woman, Thou art the man, Thou art the youth, and maiden too. Thou art the old man who totters along, leaning on the staff; Thou art born with faces turned in all directions.

# CHAPTER FOUR

There is a single Female of red, white and black colours, who is unoriginated, and who produces numerous offsprings resembling herself. By her side lies one unborn Male out of attachment for her, while another Male, also unoriginated, forsakes her after having enjoyed her:

# NOTES

1. Female of red, white and black colours = The Female referred to is Prakrti or Nature, and the three colours indicate the three Gunas or constituents of Prakrti, known as Sattva, Rajas and Tamas: Some interpret the three colours to mean the three primordial elements fire, water and earth.
2. Numerous offsprings etc = The various objects of creation: They are said to resemble Nature, because being its products, they are made of the same constituents.
3. Unborn Male = This refers to Purusa or Spirit in bondage: Male = The reference is to the Purusa.
4. Another = is to Or Spirit that has liberated itself from the trammels of Prakrti.
5. After enjoying her = After discovering, through experience, that all worldly enjoyments offered by Prakrti are mixed with misery, one gets rid of all attachment for worldly objects: The reference to the two Purusas may also be taken as signifying the individual soul and God.

# SVETASVATAROPANISAD

Two birds of beautiful plumage, who are inseparable friends, reside on the self-same tree: Of these, one eats the fruits of the tree with relish while the other looks on without eating.

# Notes

The two birds referred to in this highly poetic passage are the individual soul (Jiva) and the Supreme Soul (Paramatman). They are said to be inseparable friends, because, as the Advaitins would interpret the passage, the Jiva is only an image of the Paramatman thrown upon the mind, and hence both these are inseparable as the sun's image is from the sun; Or, if we take it in the dualistic sense, because the relationship of love existing between God and the soul, and the dependence of the latter on the former, are eternal: The tree is the body, the point of resemblance between the two being their perishableness: The soul and God are both said to reside in the same body, because in respect of the soul the body has to be conceived as its locus, and in respect of God—even though He is.

---

# CHAPTER FOUR

Transcendent, He being also immanent in all beings. He is realized by an embodied being through the means of the body. The fruits of the tree are the results of one’s Karma, or past actions, which are performed with the help of the body. Out of attachment, the individual soul clings to these fruits of actions, and suffers the consequences, good as well as bad, in successive embodiments. But the Lord, its companion bird on the tree of this body, remains non-attached to actions and their fruits, being the mere witness of this cosmic play.

If in place of this devotional interpretation we prefer a philosophic sense for this last line, we may say that behind the superficial personality of man which gets identified with various thoughts, feelings and actions that are incidental to life, there is a deeper level of being in him which remains unruffled and detached, with which unfortunately he is not in conscious touch owing to his outward-going tendencies. But in spite of this forgetfulness, it is none-the-less present there, and spiritual life is largely the establishment of this broken-off connection with it.

The same on the tree: the individual soul gets entangled, forgetting his own divine nature, being deluded, feels miserable. When the Lord, who is worshipped by all devotees, is the other.

---

# SVETASVATAROPANISAD

His greatness and thus becomes free from misery. Sitting on the same tree the individual soul gets entangled and feels miserable, being deluded on account of his forgetting his divine nature. When he sees the other, the Lord of all, whom all devotees worship, and realizes that all greatness is His, then he is relieved of his misery.

# NOTES

In the first half the Mantra points out that the forgetfulness of man's divine affinity, whether we take that affinity to mean one of identity with the Supreme, or one of inseparable loving relationship with Him, is the root of all our miseries: The second half says how man frees himself from all misery by establishing his true relationship with the Divinity:

1. Forgetting his divine nature - The word anisaya in the original, literally meaning helplessness, is interpreted in this way here, because the nature of that helplessness is its very cause, namely, ignorance or the forgetfulness of the soul's real nature i.e. its divine affinity.
2. The dualists take this to mean that God is separate from the soul. The Advaitins, however, harmonize it with their doctrine by contending that He is spoken of as the other only in relation to the soul in its embodied state, and that the expression does not therefore deny their identity from the standpoint of the highest truth.

---

# CHAPTER FOUR

3. Worship implies that all true spiritual aspirants should worship Him, and that even identity with the Divinity is realized through the grace He bestows on sincere worshippers.

4. Realizes that all greatness is His. Greatness refers to the whole of the cosmic working, of which one's individual life and activities are only an insignificant speck. One who has a vivid consciousness of the impulsion of the Divinity behind everything in this universe is no longer moved by egoism in his activities: Absence of egoism frees him from attachment, and the absence of attachment, from the misery of worldly life.

In which indestructible highest Ethereal Being the Vedas and the various gods reside, who does not know, what will he do? Only those who know That are satisfied.

Of what avail are the Vedas to him who does not know that indestructible, highest Ethereal Being, in whom the gods and the Vedas reside? Only those who know That are satisfied.

God is the subtle essence of the world, but He remains invisible to us until we feel His presence through spiritual practices.

This Divinity, the creator of the universe, the all-pervading soul, is realized by the heart (emotions), by the intellect, by imagination and will, finitized in the hearts of creatures, who always dwell there. Those who realize this become immortal.

This Divinity, who created the universe and who pervades everything, always dwells in the hearts of creatures, being finitized by emotions, intellect, will, and imagination. Those who realize this become immortal.

Notes: The passage may be taken in two ways, either (1) as referring to the psychological conditioning of the Atman in the embodied being, or (2) as indicating the way in which the Atman is intuited. Here it is translated according to the former sense. If construed with a view to give the second meaning, it will read: This Divinity, who created the universe and who...



---

# CHAPTER FOUR

pervades everything, always dwells in the hearts of creatures. They become immortal who realize Him (by the process indicated by the expression) Hrda maniga manasa abhiklptah:

The significance of this expression requires further elucidation: Our translation here being finitized by emotions, intellect, will and imagination is somewhat different from that of old commentators, most of whom take it according to the second way of construing, viz-, as referring to the way of intuiting the Atman. There are three important words in it, Hrda, Manisa and Manasa.

The word Hrd or Hrdaya (literally 'heart') is one of frequent occurrence in the Upanisads, and is given different meanings varying from the physical organ of that name to the various higher psychical levels in man like the Prana, mind, intellect, etc., up to the Atman: The connection between the physical heart and these higher levels of our being is established by the theory that the heart is their locus: Thus the Chandogyopanishad, III: 2.4 says, "All the Prapas are established in the heart:" Brhadaranyaka IV. 3. 22 speaks of the sorrows of the heart and Saikara says this is so because the lump of flesh known as the heart is the seat of the Antahkarana (inner organ), here identified with Buddhi (intellect). Brhadaranyaka III. 9. 11 says, "Whose instrument of vision is the heart" where heart means intellect according to Sankara: Again Brhadaranyaka III: 9. 20 contains the passage, "Knows colours through the heart" where heart is interpreted by Sankara as intellect and Manas (mind) taken together. Chandogya, VIII 3. 3 gives as the etymological meaning of Hrdayam "Hydi ayam iti, tasmat hrdayam" (because this one, i.e.

---

# SVETASVATAROPANISAD

Atman resides in it, it is Hrdayam). Here the heart is the seat of Atman. In the Svetasvatara we find the same idea in Mantra III. 13. Assuming a form of the size of the thumb, the Infinite Being dwells in the hearts of creatures: This gives one an idea of the wide range of meaning attached to the word heart; Our old thinkers believed that the Prapa, Buddhi and Manas, or Antahkarana as a whole, and the Atman itself, are all in a special sense centred round this most important of all physical organs this particular Svetasvatara passage.

In interpreting under discussion, many of the old commentators take Hrda or by the heart to mean by Buddhi or intellect because the heart is the seat of Buddhi. Manasa qualifies Hrda, and means that which regulates the activities of thought. Manasa means direct experience, which is of the nature of thought. Thus the meaning given to this, as well as to the identical Katha passage, by Saikara is: They become immortal, to whom this Atman is revealed through direct experience, which is of the nature of thought, and which is gained through the faculty of intellection (Buddhi) that regulates the activities of thought and resides in the heart.

Another interpreter derives the word Hrd from the root Hr (to subtract), and interprets Hrda as by the process of negating (Neti Neti) all other than Atman as objective phenomena. Manasa is by discriminative thought and Manasa is by direct experience born of both these processes. Thus the passage means according to this interpretation, Revealed by direct experience born of negation of phenomena, and of discriminative cognition.

---


# CHAPTER FOUR

of Atman as distinguished from the phenomena thus negated. We have interpreted these, and have taken it to refer not to the intuition of the Atman, but to its psychological conditioning: And we have taken the words Hrd, Manit and Manas to include all the inner faculties of man like feeling, thinking, willing and imagination.

---


# SVETASVATAROPANISAD

NOTES

1. There is only that Auspicious One. The statement that there is neither being nor non-being when ignorance is removed, may leave one the impression that the Ultimate Reality is Sunya or Void, as some philosophers hold it to be. It is to ward off this misconception that the Ultimate Reality, realized by the removal of ignorance, is described as Siva or the Auspicious One. This characterization of the Supreme suggests the idea that while He is beyond all the relativities of life—our notions of light and darkness, knowledge and ignorance, being and non-being—He is, in a transcendental sense, the summation of all the highest values we know of in life. In other words, while the Absolute negates all relativity, He is not something less but more than it. So He is spoken of as imperishable, and worthy of being adored even by the creator or demiurge, who is the highest being conceivable from our relative point of view.
2. Ancient wisdom: God is the source of all wisdom which has come down to us in the form of the Vedas.

Suq above fraqacross 764 in the middle gT Him J naaa no One can grasp. Whose name is none equal to Him. No one can grasp Him above, or across, or in the middle. There is none equal to Him whose name is great glory.



---

# CHAPTER FOUR

97

# NOTES

1. No one can grasp Him etc. - This shows that He is not specially limited.
2. None equal - The word Pratima (here translated as 'equal') does not refer to any image, as is interpreted by some who are not in favour of image worship; according to them the passage means, There is no image of Him. The true meaning of it, however, is that He has no equal.

His form does not stand in the field of vision. No one perceives Him with the eye. Those who know Him through the faculty of intuition as thus seated in their heart, become immortal:

# NOTES

1. Intuition - This is clearly a reference to the way of realizing the Atman, which cannot be seen by the ordinary sensuous perception as mentioned in the previous line. The super-sensuous and super-rational way of knowing is what is called intuition: Is this faculty something entirely different from the mental.

---


98 SVETAsVATAROPANISAD

faculties of man? The Upanisad does not seem to say SO, for what we have interpreted as by intuition is jn the original represented by the two words Hrda (by the heart) and Manasa (by the mind). For detailed comments on these words, the reader may refer to the Notes on Mantra 17 of this Chapter: The combination of these words implies that intuition is only the heightened power of cognition born of the refinement and concentration of all the faculties of the mind—feeling, thought and will. In other words, in the experience of the Atman is involved not any one of these faculties alone, but all of them purified by ethical life, and unified by the power of concentration into a form of cognition that gives unerring and unshakable certainty.

# NOTES

1. Ground - Mulaprakrti Or Maya which is the ultimate source or ground of creation: The word ksetra (field) in the text suggests the idea of vegetation springing up from barren ground and decaying there itself, only to appear again afresh in proper season.
2. Again - Refers to cycles of creation.

Just as the sun shines lighting up all space above, below and across, even so does that one adorable God; the repository of all goodness and greatness, preside over everything that has the nature of a cause.

# NOTES

Everything that has the nature of a cause-Nature (Prakrti) and its evolutes. All these, which are variously conceived as the causes of the world by different schools of philosophy and science, are not in themselves causes of the world. They deserve the name cause only because God works through them:

# CHAPTER FIVE

He who is the one source of the world brings out everything out of His own Nature, and leads creatures to perfection according to their deserts, and endows each being with its distinguishing characteristic. Thus he presides over the whole universe:

[NoTES_The Mantra conveys the idea that the whole evolution of the universe is to be traced ultimately to the Divinity, but in the details of the cosmic process like the birth and growth of individuals, as well as in the periodic recurrence of creation and dissolution, He is guided by the law of Karma. The expression 'according to' their deserts points out the right place of Karma in the development of individuals]

# CHAPTER FIVE

Only he who gets attached to the pleasurable qualities of things does work for the sake of its fruits, and enjoys the fruits of his own deeds. Though really the master of the senses, he becomes bound by the three Gunas, and assuming various forms, wanders about through the three paths as a result of his own deeds.

# NOTES

1. Three paths - Dharma (righteousness), Adharma (unrighteousness) and Jnana (knowledge). It may also mean the three well-known paths along which the soul proceeds after the death of the gross body. These are Devayana (the path of the Gods), Pitryana (the path of the Fathers) and Tiryanmarga (the path to lowest births).

Subtle as the point of a goad, pure, effulgent and infinite like the sun; He alone goes beyond the limitations of the Buddhi associated with the ego and the Sankalpa, which is bound by the finiteness of the heart of the size of a thumb and is seen:

1. Subtle - Incapable of being known by the gross mind and the senses:
2. Another - The Jiva or individual soul. That the individual soul should be conceived as the manifestation of the Supreme Being is the purport of the Mantra.
3. Sankalpa - The quality of the mind due to which it finds attraction for something which does not really deserve it:
4. Intellect - The intellect and the heart referred to here are the two most important aspects of human personality. The individual soul, which is of the same nature of the Supreme Being, looks otherwise because of the limitations of these, its manifesting mediums.

# NOTES

1. Withdrawing - The expression means that though God creates the universe and enters into active relation with it, yet He remains aloof as the silent witness.
2. With one, with two, etc - The meaning of these is very obscure. We take the sense to be as follows: one = Avidya (ignorance); two = Dharma and Adharma (the good and evil effects of the actions of past lives); three = the three bodies - the physical, subtle and causal bodies; eight = the eightfold aspect of Nature, as described in the Gita, viz. the five elements, mind, intellect and egoism.
3. Through the mere instrumentality of time etc - The idea seems to be that though God is the ultimate

force at the back of the world process indicated by the expression unites the principle of Spirit with Matter, with one, with two, etc. yet His hand is invisible, and to a person who seeks some natural explanation of things, time, inherent property of things, etc. appear to be all-sufficient explanations: Really they are only the instruments through which the Divinity works:

T who associated with Gupas #aif creation #TATA beings Afa- Muqa orders, €: 0 Heavq their #aa in the absence the destroyer of created objects: after the destruction of created objects aeaa: in His essence 5a7: other qla remains.

He gives the start to the creation associated with the three Gunas of Nature, and orders all things. Again, in the absenceᴸ of the Gupas, He destroys all created objects, and after destruction, remains aloof in His essence.

[NOTES_The Mantra is difficult to interpret; Some commentators take it, not in the cosmic sense given here, but in a spiritual sense, and interpret it thus: Having



---

# CHAPTER SIX

Performed work associated with Gunas and dedicated them all to the Lord, man is liberated from Karma and the cycle of births and deaths, the effects of his actions being all destroyed by non-attachment. While such an interpretation is quite acceptable, we have none-the-less translated it in the cosmic sense, as done by Max Miiller, because the Mantra occurs in a context dealing exclusively with the glory of God as the creator, preserver, and destroyer of the universe.

# 1. Absence of the Gunas

The idea is that it is when the three Gunas or the three constituents of Nature like Sattva, Rajas and Tamas lose their equilibrium that a new cycle of creation starts. When the three Gunas are absent; i.e. regain their equilibrium, and are no longer operative, cosmic dissolution or Pralaya takes place.

# 118 SVETAs VATAROPANISAD

By previously1 meditating as seated in one's own heart, on that Adorable Being who appears as the universe, and who is the true source of all creatures, He can be perceived even though He is the primeval cause of the union (of Spirit with Matter), as well as the partless entity transcending the three divisions of time:

# NOTES

The purpose of the Mantra seems to be to stress the cosmic grandeur of the Deity, as well as His uniqueness as the Transcendent and the Absolute, and at the same time to emphasize that in spite of all this He reveals Himself, both in His personal and impersonal aspects, in the heart of one who meditates on Him in the true spirit;

1. Previously Meditating—The implication is that the loving contemplation and worship of the Deity is the necessary preliminary step for realizing Him both as the Personal God with attribute and as the Impersonal Absolute. The necessary mental fitness for Jiana or realization of the Absolute and the identity of the self with It, is born of loving worship and contemplation of the Personal Deity—may, according to many great authorities including Sri Ramakrishna and the Bhagavad-gita, this very realization is bestowed on the devotee; who wants it, by the God of love out of His infinite grace. In the words of Sri Ramakrishna, this monistic realization is like a master placing a faithful and beloved servant of his on his own seat of authority, and calling him his very self:

Knowing Him who is the origin and dissolution of the universe~the source of all virtue, the destroyer of all sins, the master of all good qualities, the immortal, and the abode of the universe as seated in one's own self, He is perceived as different from, and transcending, the tree of Samsara as well as time and form.

[NOTES_This Mantra is only another striking expression of the great Vedantic doctrine that the clue to the nature of the Deity lies in one's own heart: The self of man is the best reflector of the Divinity, and if He is discovered as immanent in the self, He is also simultaneously realized as transcending Nature. Thus

[NOTES-1. No sign etc. There is no syllogism that can logically demonstrate the existence of God. He is essentially known through revelation and spiritual realization, and the function of logic or reason is only to relate the knowledge thus gained with the rest of our experience:]

# NOTES

1. Eternals - Manifestations of Matter like ether and the other elements, which are taken to be eternal by common men and some philosophers; But in reality God is the only eternal substance.
2. All that are intellect - This expression means either the many knowers (individual souls), or the various organs of knowledge, internal and external, like the senses and the mind, which appear to be intelligent to the ordinary man: In either case God is the intelligent entity in their midst in a unique sense, because the individual knowers are only His expressions, and the organs of knowledge only reflect the intelligence of Him who is the eternal witness.
3. Many - The countless numbers of beings in various stages of evolution, like the Gods; men, animals; etc.

The sun does not shine there; neither the moon, nor the stars. There these lightnings shine not—how then this fire? Because He shines, everything shines after Him. By His light all this shines.

# Notes

By speaking of the Deity as the source of all luminosity, the Sruti refers not so much to any brilliance in a material sense, as to the fact that all knowing, whether through sensuous perception or other processes, takes place due to Him, the source of all intelligence: Light is symbolically used to indicate knowledge.

[NOTES--By speaking of God as the fire stationed in water, the Sruti indicates that Pure Spirit is immanent in the world, however different the latter might appear to be from it (as fire is from water) in point of grossness, corruption and other unspiritual qualities: The Mantra also makes it clear that the fire worshipped by the Vedic Rsis, which was considered by them symbolically as hidden in the waters, is none other than this great god concealed in the midst of this world of change and limitation:]
