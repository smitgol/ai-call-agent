# CHAPTER ONE

# (The five incarnations of the supreme Brahman)

I bow to lord Siva of great bliss and of endless divine sports, who is great and omnipresent, who is the beloved consort of Parvati, who is the progenitor of Karttikeya and Gane£a, and who is the primordial lord of the universe.

Saunaka said:

1. O Suta, O great fortunate disciple of Vyasa, O storehouse of wisdom and mercy, please narrate the incarnations of lord Siva by means of which the lord enhanced the welfare of the good.

Suta said:

O sage Saunaka, with great devotion I shall narrate the incarnations of Siva to you a sage. Listen to it with attention and control over the senses.
O sage, formerly, Nandin, a form of Siva and goal of the good, when asked by Sanatkumara, told him the narrative with devotion to Siva.

i. The concept of Rudrasr$ti can be traced as far back as the Vedic Literature. According to Yv i6- 4 one Rudra created many Rudras out of his own body. The PurSnas too have recorded the tradition of many Rudras evolved out of a single Rudra. The present Saiiihita describes one hundred incarnations of Siva and is therefore called Satarudra.

But according to SB (9. 1.1.7), Satarudriya means a single hundred-headed Siva. This statement of Satapatha Brahmnna negates the concept of many Rudras evolved out of a single Rudra. But it is not corroborated by the evidence of the present Saihhitfl which enumerates the countless forms of Rudra.

4. The incarnations of the omnipresent lord Siva are countless in the different aeons, Yet I shall narrate them as far as I know.

5. The nineteenth Kalpa is known as Svetalohita. The first incarnation is glorified as the incarnation of Sadyojata.

6. In that Kalpa, Svetalohita, endowed with a tuft, was born as the son of Brahma as he meditated upon the supreme Brahman.

7. On seeing that Being in the form of Brahman and realising that to be Hvara, Brahma meditated on him in his heart and saluted him with palms joined in reverence.

8. Knowing that Sadyojata to be Siva, Brahma, the lord of the worlds became delighted. With pure intelligence he pondered over that great Being again and again.

9. As he thus meditated, sons white in colour and famous for valour, were born to him. They were of great wisdom and had the form of the Supreme Brahman.

10. They were Sunanda, Nandana, Vhvananda and Upanandana. They were the disciples of that noble soul. By them the Brahman was encircled.

11. The delighted great lord, the Sadyojata incarnation of Siva, lovingly bestowed on Brahma the perfect wisdom and the power of creation.

12. The next Kalpa, the twentieth one is named and glorified as Rakta (red) wherein Brahma assumed a great splendour red in hue.

13. As Brahma desirous of sons meditated, a son appeared in front of him wearing red garments and garlands. His eyes were red and his ornaments too were red.

14. On seeing that noble-souled son, he resorting to meditation knew him as the Vamadeva incarnation of Siva and so bowed to him with palms joined in reverence.

15. Your sons wearing red garments were born of him Viz. Virajas, VivSha, ViSoka and ViSvabhSvana.

'2. A kalpa is a day of Brahm£ or one thousand yugas equal to a period four hundred thirty two million years of mortals. Each kalpa is presided over by a particular form of Rudra. For instance, the Svetalohita kalpa has Sadyojata as the presiding deity, Rakta has Vamadeva, Pftav&#x26;sas has Tatpurufa, Siva has Aghora and Visva-rfipa has liSna.

The delighted ParameSvara, the Vamadeva incarnation of Siva bestowed on Brahma lovingly, the power of creation and perfect wisdom.

# 17.

The twenty-first Kalpa is said to be Pftavasas wherein Brahma of great achievement became yellow-robed.

# 18.

As Brahma desirous of sons meditated, a son was born unto him mature, of great arms and great splendour and wearing yellow garments.

# 19-20.

On seeing him engrossed in meditation and realising that Being as Siva, the Creator bowed to him after performing the Japa of Siva-Gayatri, who is the great goddess, bowed to by all the worlds. The great god was delighted with the mind in contemplation.

# 21.

Then from his sides sons of divine features issued forth. All of them had yellow garments and they were the instigators of the Yogic path.

# 22.

When that Kalpa of yellow colour of the selfborn lord elapsed, another Kalpa set in and it was named Siva.

# 23.

After a thousand divine years had elapsed and the entire universe had become one vast ocean, Brahma desirous of creating subjects thought in sorrow.

# 24.

That lord of great splendour saw a son coming into view. He was black in colour, possessed of great strength. He was shining in his own splendour.

# 25.

He was clad in black clothes and a black turban. He wore a black sacred thread. He had a black coronet, black toilet and unguent articles.

# 26.

On seeing that noble soul of terrible—exploits, (named) Aghora (non-terrible), he worshipped him the lord of god, of wonderful black and tawny colour.

# 27.

Brahma then contemplated on Aghora in the form of Brahman. He eulogised that unperishing Being favourably disposed towards his devotees, by means of pleasing words.

# 28.

Then from his sides sprang up four noble-souled sons all of whom were black in colour and had black toilet and unguent articles.

# 29.

These brilliant beings in the form of Siva had the

30. The noble-souled beings of this nature initiated the great and wonderful Yoga called Ghora for the purpose of Brahma’s creation.

31. O great sages, then another extremely wonderful Kalpa of Brahma, named ViSvarupa began to function.

32. As Brahma, desirous of sons, meditated on Siva mentally, Sarasvatl (Goddess of speech) of great sound manifested herself. She was VH pa (Universe-formed).

33. Isanu of such renowned features, supreme lord of crystal-like pure brilliance and bedecked in all ornaments manifested himself.

34. On seeing the unborn lord, all pervading, all-bestowing, the all-in-all, of good forms as well as formless, Brahma bowed to him.

35. Lord Isana after instructing the path of the good to Brahma, created four auspicious sons in collaboration with his Energy.

36. There were born Jatin, Mundin, Sikhandin and Ardhamunda. By means of Yoga they imparted good virtue and attained the goal of Yoga.

37. Thus I have succinctly narrated the origin of Sadyojata and others, Sanatkumara, O omniscient one, being desirous of the welfare of all the worlds.

38. Then, O intelligent one, their dealings are beneficial to the three worlds and everything that is existent in the universe.

39. The five famous forms of Maheja are thus named

| The five forms of Siva viz Isina, Tatpuru$a, Aghora, Vdmadeva and Sadyojata are creative. They are symbolical of the scheme of creation evolved out of twenty-five constituents viz. five gross and five subtle elements, five organs of action and five of knowledge, besides mina, ego, intellect, nature and the individual soul.

l£ana form of Siva is the first and the principal one. It directly occupies and presides over the individual soul, the enjoyer of Prakrti.

# 41.

Tatpuru?a form of Siva is the second. It occupies and presides over every object of enjoyment, the support of the attributes.

# 42.

The third form of Siva is Aghora that stands within, occupies and presides over the principle of intelligence with all its ramifications for the sake of Dharma.

# 43.

The fourth form of Siva is Vamadeva who presides over the ego and is engaged in many incessant activities.

# 44.

The I$ana form of Siva is the permanent lord of the organ of hearing, speech and the all-pervading sky.

# CHAPTER TWO

# ( The eight farms of Siva )

Nandiivara said :

1. O dear sage, listen to the great incarnations of lord Siva that carry out all worldly activities and bestow happiness on all.
2. The universe consists of the eight forms of lord Siva. Pervading that the universe subsists like the pearls in the string.
3. The eight presiding deities are Sarva, Bhava, Rudra, Ugra, Bhima, Palupati, liana and Mahadeva. They are well known.
4. By these eight forms of Siva, viz. Sarva etc, the earth, the waters, the fire, the wind, the sky, the individual soul, the sun and the moon are presided over.
5. The conclusion of all sacred lore is that the form of lord Siva consisting of the earth that holds the entire universe of the mobile and immobile beings is called Sarva.
6. The form of the Supreme Soul, consisting of water that enlivens the entire world, is called Bhava.
7. The form of the great lord Siva that holds the outer and inner universe and throbs by itself is called Ugra by the noble.
8. That form of lord Siva consisting of the firmament that pervades everything and affords space to all is called Bhima and it splits and differentiates the group of elements.
9. That form of Siva shall be known as Palupati which is the support of individual souls, and abiding therein splits the bondage that encircles them.
10. Brightening the entire universe in the form of the sun, the form of Siva, liana, moves about in the heaven.

The eight forms of lord Siva constitute the five gross material elements, the soul, the sun and the moon. Each form stands in relation to its constituents as follows:

| Bhava    | — | water |
| -------- | - | ----- |
| Rudra    | — | Ugra  |
| Sarva    | — | earth |
| fire     | — | wind  |
| Bhima    | — | ether |
| Palupati | — | soul  |
| liana    | — | sun   |
| Mahadeva | — | moon  |



---


1 1. The moon of nectarlike rays that strengthens and fattens the universe to satiety, is the form of lord Siva called Mahadeva.

12. The eighth form of Siva, the great soul, is the Atman, more pervasive than the other forms. The universe is pervaded by that form.

13. By watering the root of a tree the branches of the tree blossom. Similarly the body of the universe develops by means of worshipping Siva.

14. Just as a father is delighted at the pleasures of sons, grandsons and others, so also Siva is delighted at the pleasures of the universe.

15. Should the slaughter or captivity of a person be carried out, undoubtedly it is an offence committed against the eight-formed lord Siva.

16. Worship Siva who presides over the universe in the eightfold forms with all devotion. Worship Rudra, the great cause.

17. O son of Brahma, thus the well known eight forms have been explained to you. These forms engaged in helping everyone shall be resorted to by those who seek glory.

# CHAPTER THREE

# (The half incarnation of Lord Siva) -female

Nandiivara said:

1. O dear one of great intellect, please listen to the description of Siva’s form half-male and half-female, than which there is nothing more excellent and which completes the work of the Creator.

6. The half-male and half-female (ardhanarlsvara) form of Siva is symbolical of the process of creation by copulation. The concept is comparable to the S&#x26;mkhya doctrine of Purusa (cosmic soul) and Prakfti (cosmic nature), whose union produces the different units of the universe.

1. When the subjects created by the Creator did not multiply, he was very much distressed and worried.
2. Then a celestial voice said "Carry on the creation produced by couples.” On hearing it, Brahma pondered over the creation produced by couples in order to carry it out.
3. Since no generation of women had formerly come out of Isana, the lotus-born deity (Brahma) was unable to produce the creation by means of copulation.
4. Brahma then began to perform penance thinking "Without the power of Siva, the subjects will not be born.”
5. Within his heart he pondered lovingly over lord Siva united with the great Sakti called Siva. He then performed great penance.
6. Ere long Siva became satisfied with the severe penance of the self-born lord Brahma.
7. Then assuming the wish-yielding form of Isana the perfect consciousness, and in the guise of half-male and half-female form Siva approached Brahma.
8. On seeing lord Siva united with great Sakti and bowing to him prostrate, Brahma eulogised him with palms joined in reverence.
9. Then the delighted lord Siva, the creator of the universe, spoke in words majestic in sound like that of rumbling cloud.

Lord Siva said:

“O dear son of great fortune, O grandfather, I have understood correctly all that you have cherished in your mind.
It is for the increase of the subjects that this penance has been performed by you now. I am delighted by that penance. I shall confer on you what you desire.”
After saying these naturally sweet and magnanimous words, lord Siva detached Siva from his body.
On seeing that great Sakti, detached separately from Siva, Brahma bowed to her politely and requested her. Brahma said:
“O Siv3, I created at first your husband

the lord of gods. I was ordered by Siva the great soul to create the subjects,

16. O Siva, the gods and others were mentally created by me. But they do not multiply themselves. Hence they are being created again and again.

17. Hereafter I wish to make all my subjects flourish by making the creation originate from pairs.

18. The unchanging generation of women has not come out of you before. Hence I do not have the power to create women.

19. All Saktis spring up from you. Hence I request you the great Sakti, the goddess of all.

20. O Siva, O mother, O beloved of Siva, for the increase of the mobile and immobile beings of the universe, give me the power to create women. Obeisance be to you.

21. O goddess bestowing boons, I request for another boon from you. O mother of the universe, take pity on me and grant that too unto me. Obeisance be to you.

22. O omnipresent mother, be born as the daughter of Dak$a, my son, for the increase of the mobile and immobile beings through only ISa.

23. Thus implored by the Creator, the Supreme goddess consented and bestowed that power upon the Creator.

24. Hence that goddess Siva, the Sakti of Siva constituting the universe, created a Sakti equal in lustre unto her self, from the middle of her eyebrows.

25. Siva, the foremost among gods, the ocean of mercy, the great I Sana indulging in divine sports saw that Sakti and laughingly spoke to her.

Lori Siva said: —

26. “O goddess, you have been propitiated by Brahma, through his penance. Lovingly become pleased with him and fulfil his desires.”

27. Receiving that behest of lord Siva with her bent head, the goddess became the daughter of Dak§a on the opportunity of Brahma.

28. O sage, after giving the unequalled power to Brahma, the goddess Siva entered the body of Siva. And lord Siva vanished from the scene.



---


29. Ever since then, the section of women was created in the world, Brahma attained bliss. Creation became copulatory. Thus O dear, the excellent Siva, half-male and half-female that bestows auspiciousness upon the good has been told.

30. He who reads or listens to this pious narrative enjoys all pleasures and attains to the greatest goal.

# CHAPTER FOUR

# (The story of Rfabha)

Ncmdiivara said:

1. O omniscient Sanatkum&#x26;ra, the story of Siva that ever confers happiness, was gladly and lovingly narrated by Siva to BrahmS.

Lord Siva said:

2-3. In the seventh Viraha Kalpa, in the Vaivasvata Manvantara, the lord Kalpeivara who illuminates all the worlds will be born as your great grandson and son of Vaivasvata Manu. O Creator, in that Manvantara all the four Yugas will take place.

4. For the welfare of the worlds and for the benefit of the brahmins O Creator, whatever will take place in the Yuga called Dvapara, I foresee now.

5-6. In that first Yuga, towards the close of Dvapara and the beginning of Kali when Vyisa is Svayamprabhu I will be born as the great sage named Sveta, with a tuft, for the welfare of Brahmins.

7. Then O Brahmfi, on the mountain Ghigalaᵀ the beautiful summit of Himavat, will be born my disciples endowed with tuft.

7. Chlgala, one of the peaks of the Himilayat, has not been identified so far.

# 8.

Those four disciples Sveta, Sveta&#x26;ikha, Svetaiva, and Svetalohita will come to my city by the Yoga of meditation.

# 9.

Realising my unchanging real form, the devotees will become devoid of birth, death and old age and will meditate on the Supreme Brahman.

# 10.

O dear Pitamaha, except through meditation I cannot be seen by men by resorting to charitable gifts and sacred rites that bring about the bondage of Karman.

# 11.

In the second aeon of Dvapara when the patriarch Satya becomes Vyasa I will be born as Sutira and continue to live in Kali age.

# 12.

There too my disciples will be the four Brahmins well-versed in the Vedic lore viz. Dundubhi, Satarupa, Hf^ika and Ketumfin.

By resorting to the Yoga of meditation all the four will go to my city and then realising my unchanging real form they will become liberated.

# 14.

In the third aeon of Dvapara in the age of Bhirgava Vyasa I will be born as Damana at the outskirts of the city.

# 15.

Four sons will be born of me there viz —Vrioka, Viiesa, Vipfipa and Papana<ana class="<" p="">

</ana>
# 16.

O four-faced deity, I will help Vyasa and will propagate firmly the path of renunciation in the Kali age.

# 17.

In the fourth aeon of Dvapara in the age of Angiras Vyasa, I shall be born as Suhotra.

# 18.

There also four sons will be born of me all aspiring after the Yogic path and noble-souled. O Brahma, I shall mention their names.

# 19.

They are Sumukha, Durmukha, Durdarbha and Duratikrama. O Brahma, I shall then render help to Vyasa through the disciples.

# 20.

In the fifth aeon of Dvapara there will be Savitri Vyasa. I shall be born as a Yogin of great penance and called KaAka.

# 21.

There also four sons will be born of me, all aspiring after the Yogic path and noble-souled. Please hear their names from me.

# 22.

They are Sanaka, Sanitana, Sanandana and Sanat-kumara freed from sin and egotism.



---


# 23.

There also O Brahma, I, named Kanka, enhancing the path of renunciation shall render help to Vyasa in the form of Savitr.

# 24.

When the sixth aeon of Dvapara takes place there will be Mrtyu Vyasa who will classify the Vedas.

# 25.

Then I will be born as Lokaksi, making the path of renunciation flourish and helping Vyasa.

# 26.

Four disciples of steady rites viz. Sudhama, Virajas, Sanjaya and Vijaya will be born then.

# 27.

# CHAPTER SEC

# (The incarnation of Nandiivara)

Sanatkumāra said:

1. O lord, how did you happen to be born of Mahadeva and gain access to Siva? I wish to hear. Please narrate everything in detail.

Hānīśvara said:

O sage Sanatkumara, O omniscient one, listen with attention as to how I was born of Mahadeva and how I gained access to Siva.
Urged eagerly by the manes who desired their uplift, Silada piously thought of raising them up. He was therefore desirous of a progeny. For that he of great potentiality performed a penance with his drooping eyes. He had the same activities as the sages. He went to Sivaloka.
That sage Silada performed a severe penance with Indra in view, for a long time. His mind was steady and he was steadfast in his activities.
Indra was delighted at his penance. He, the lord of gods, went to him in order to grant him the boon.
Indra lovingly spoke to Silada— “O excellent sage, sinless one, I am delighted with you. Therefore choose your boons."

# Satarudrasarhfdti

8. Bowing to the lord of the gods and eulogising him with holy hymns, Silada, the most excellent sage, told him with palms joined in reverence.

Silada said:

9. O lord of gods, O Indra, if you are pleased with me, I wish to have a son of holy rites free of death and not born of a womb.

Indra said: O desirer of a son, I can give you only a son born of a womb and sure to die. I cannot give it to you otherwise. There are no persons who can escape death.

10. I shall not give you a son devoid of death and not born of a womb. O great sage, even lord Viṣṇu and Brahma die. Not to speak of others then?

11. Even these two, born of Siva, the destroyer of the Tripuras, die. The extent of their longevity has been mentioned separately in the sacred lore.

12. Hence O great brahmin, abandon your desire of a deathless son who is not born of a womb. Accept a son befitting your mortal nature.

13. But if Siva, the lord of the gods, becomes delighted, even an immortal son not born of a womb, though hard to get, may be obtained.

14. Neither I, nor lord Visnu, nor Brahma, O great sage, can give an immortal son not born of a womb.

15. Propitiate lord Siva therefore, for the fulfilment of your desire for such a son. The great lord of all is very powerful. He will give you a son.

NandiSvara said:

16. O sage, after speaking thus to the great brahmin and blessing him, the compassionate lord of the gods returned to his region surrounded by the gods.

17. When the granter of boons, the thousand-eyed lord Indra had gone away, Silada propitiated lord Siva. He delighted Siva by means of his penance.

18. As the brahmin was engrossed in penance day and night, a thousand divine years elapsed like a moment.

20-21. His body was covered with anthill. He was surrounded by a hundred thousand worms, with pointed beaks, as hard as adamant and other types of blood-sucking insects all round. He remained in the cavity with his flesh and blood drained up. He was left with a bare skeleton. The excellent sage Silada was reduced to such a state.

22. The delighted lord showed him his divine body endowed with all divine qualities and inaccessible to people of crooked intellect.

23. As he continued the penance for a thousand divine years, the trident-bearing lord of all the gods spoke to him “I am here, the granter of boons."

24. The great sage Silida engrossed in the great trance did not hear those words of Siva who is subservient to the devotees.

25. Only when the great sage was touched by the slayer of the Tripuras did he leave off his penance.

26. O sage, on seeing Siva accompanied by Parvati after opening his eyes, he immediately bowed to him and fell at his feet with joy.

27. The delighted Silada, drooping down his shoulders, with palms joined in reverence eulogised lord Siva with words choked with pleasure.

28. Then the delighted lord of gods, the three-eyed deity told the great sage “I am the granter of boons."

29. O intelligent one, what shall be done with this penance? I shall give you a son who will be omniscient and a master of all sacred lore.

30. On hearing that, the sage Silada bowed to the moon-crested lord and spoke in words choked with pleasure. Silada said:

31. O lord Siva, if you are delighted, if you are ready to grant boons, I wish for a son equal to you, devoid of death and not born of a womb.

Nandiivara said:

32. When thus requested by him, the three-eyed lord Siva delightedly replied to the excellent sage Silada.

^atarudrasarhhitS

Siva said: O brahmin, O sage, I formerly have been propitiated by means of penance by Brahma, by sages and by leading gods and urged to take an incarnation.

O sage, I shall become your son by the name of Nandin. I shall not be born of a womb. Thus you shall be my father, of me who am the father of the worlds.

NandUvara said:

After addressing these words to the sage who stood waiting after bowing, the merciful lord Siva gave him his directions and vanished there itself along with Pfirvatf.

After lord Siva had disappeared, the great sage Silada returned to his hermitage and mentioned the tidings to the sages.

After a short while, my father, the foremost among those who knew the sacrificial rites, ordered for the construction of the sacrificial altar for the performance of sacrifice.

But before the beginning of sacrifice I was born as Siva’s son at his bidding, with a lustre as brilliant as the fire at the end of a Yuga.

Then Pu$karavartakaᵃˡ and other clouds showered. When I was born as the son of Silada, the Kinnaras, Siddhas, Sadhyas and other beings walked through the sky and the great sages made showers of flowers all round.

Then Brahma and other gods together with their wives, Vi$nu, Siva and Parvati came there lovingly.

There was great jubilation. The celestial damsels danced. After honouring me all of them delightedly eulogised my phallic image.

After praising Silada and eulogising Siva and Parvati by reciting good hymns all of them returned to their respective abodes. Siva and Siva, the lord and goddess of all, went away too.

On seeing me the boy with three eyes, four arms and lustre like that of Yama, sun and fire and clad in matted hair and coronet, Silada was highly delighted.

# Nanditvara said:

# 46.

My delighted father after bowing to the great lord returned to his hut with me, as pleased as an indigent person who had struck a treasure-trove.

# 47.

O great sage, when I reached the hut I cast off divine form and assumed the human one.

# 48.

After seeing me assuming human form, my father, honoured by the world, was distressed and so lamented surrounded by his own people.

When I completed the age of seven, the two sages Mitra and Varuna came to the hermitage at the bidding of the lord in order to see me.

# 52.

Duly welcomed by the sage and seated on their seats, the great sages of noble soul looked at me again and again and said.

# Mitra and Varuna said:

# 53.

a dead body I spoke after remembering the lotus-like feet of Siya with a delightful mind.

56. “O father, what is your distress for which you tremble and cry? I wish to know correctly whence this misery has come to you?”

The father said:

57. O son, I am much distressed at the thought of your early death. Who can remove my misery? I shall indeed seek refuge in him.

The son said:

58-59. Even if the gods, demons, Yama or Kila were to be angry with me or even if it be any other person, I will not be short-lived. Do not be grieved, father, I speak the truth, I take a vow unto you.

The father said:

60. What is your penance? What is your knowledge? What is your Yoga? Who is your lord? Whereby O son, you propose to ward off my terrible misery?

The son said:

61. O father, I shall deceive death by means of my penance, not learning. By worshipping great god, I will conquer death, not otherwise.

Nandifvara said:

62. O sage, after saying this and bowing at his feet and circumambulating my father I went to the excellent forest.

# CHAPTER SEVEN

# (The coronation and the nuptials of Nandi Svara)

Nandiivara said:

1. O sage, after going there and staying in an isolated place with a steady mind I performed a severe penance very difficult even for good sages.
2. Meditating in the lotus-like cavity of the heart the lord Tryambaka, Sadaiva with five faces, ten arms and three eyes and quiet in features I performed the repetition of Rudra Japa. I was in great meditation on the northern bank of the river. My mind was concentrated and I had pure thoughts.
3. Delighted with that Japa, lord Siva, accompanied by Parvati and bedecked with the crescent moon, said:

Siva said:

“O Sailadi (son of Silada) I have been pleased by this penance of yours. O intelligent one, you have performed the penance very well. Tell me what you desire. I am here the granter of boons.”
When thus addressed by the lord I bowed to his feet with my head and eulogised lord Siva, the destroyer of the sorrow of old age.
I was endowed with great devotion. My eyes were filled with tears. I fell prostrate at his feet with my head resting there. Lord Siva, the destroyer of great distress, lifted me up and stroked me with his hands. The bull-bannered lord clasped me with his hands and stood face to face with me.
Glancing at the leaders of the Ganas and the goddess, the daughter of Himavat, the lord of the worlds, looked at me with sympathy and spoke.
“Dear Nandin, O intelligent one, wherefore can you be afraid of death? The two brahmins were sent by me alone. There is no doubt. You are equal to me.
You will be free from death and old age. You

12. company and will be loved by all in the of your father friends.

You will gain strength from me. You will always be at my sides. You will be for ever my favourite. Due to my favour you will have neither birth, nor death, nor old age.

Nandttvara said:

13. After saying thus, the store-house of mercy took off his own lotus-garland round his head and tied it round my neck immediately.

14. O brahmin, as soon as that garland adorned my neck I became three-eyed and ten-armed like a second Siva.

15. Then, taking me by the hand, lord Siva said “Tell me, what excellent boon shall I grant you?”

16. Then he took the water from his matted hair, water as pure as necklace, and said “Be Nandin.” Then the bull-bannered lord let off the water.

17. Then five auspicious rivers flowed. They had pure water. They were very rapid. They were beautiful and divine in form.

18. The five rivers are glorified thus Jafodaka, Trisrotas, Vr§adhvani, Svarnodaka and Jambunadi.

19. O sage, this basin called Paficanada is a very auspicious spot of Siva. It is near JapeSvara and is very holy.

20. He who goes to the holy centre of Paficanada, takes his bath there, performs the Japa of the lord of lords and worships him, certainly attains the Sayujya of Siva.

31. Then Siva said to Parvati “I am going to coronate Nandin and proclaim him as the lord of Ganas. O unchanging goddess, what do you think?”

24. This group of five rivers is mythical. It is not appropriate to identify the Trisrotas of this group with the Teesta in North Bengal and the Jambu with the Jambu of mount Abu. For the Purflpa speaks of the group of five rivers forming a confluence near JapeSvara. The Teesta and the Jambu meet nowhere and cannot be held identical with the Trisrotas and the Jambu that have entered into this group.

22. O lord of gods, it behoves you to give that to Nandin. O lord, Sailadi is my most beloved son.

23. Then Siva the independent lord, the Supreme deity, the bestower of everything and favourably disposed towards his devotees remembered his excellent leaders of Ganas.

24. Even as they were remembered, all the leading Ganas of Rudra came there. They were countless. They had the shape of Siva. They were highly delighted.

25. Those leading Ganas bowed to lord Siva and the goddess Parvati with joined palms and drooping shoulders. The powerful Ganas spoke.

The leading Ganas said:

26. O great lord, the destroyer of Tripuras, why are we called? Please command us, O bestower of wishes. We are your servants and we have come here.

27. Shall we dry up the oceans? Shall we kill Yama with his servants? Shall we slay great death of the aged Brahma especially?

28. Shall we bind Indra with all the gods or Vishnu with all his Parsadas and bring them here? Or the Daityas and Danavas?

29. To whom shall we cause great and terrible distress at your behest? O lord, who is to be extremely jubilant today for the increase of all cherished desires?

Nandtfvara said:

30. On hearing these heroic words of the Ganas the great lord spoke after praising them.

Siva said:

31. NandiSvara is my son. He is the lord of lords. He is the favourite leader of my Ganas. Let my behest be carried out by you.

32. All of you, crown him lovingly as your leader and resort of all my Ganas. From today onwards, Nandilvara is your lord.

4. O son, your father will be endowed with all prosperity. He will become a presiding officer of the Ganas, a great devotee of mine and very powerful.
5. O dear son, your grandfather too shall be likewise. This is my rule that whoever approaches me is certainly endowed with a boon.

JVandUvara said:

Then the goddess, the granter of the boon and of great fortune told me — “Speak out what is your desire. Tell me all your wishes.”
On hearing those words of the goddess, I spoke with palms joined in reverence “O goddess, let my excellent devotion be always towards your feet.”
On hearing my words the goddess said “Let it be so.” With great pleasure Siva spoke to SuyaSa, the beloved wife of Nandin.

The goddess said:

Dear daughter, as you desire I grant you the boon that you will be endowed with three eyes. You will be devoid of future births. You will have devotion to me along with your husband, sons and grandsons.

Nandin said:

Then the delighted Brahmâ, Viṣṇu, all the gods...

Satarudrasarhhitd 1097 and the Ganas gave them boons with pleasure at the behest of Siva.

59. Taking me along with all the members of the family, kinsmen and relatives, lord Siva mounted his bull and went to the abode of the goddess.

60. Vi$nu and all other gods praising these and eulogising Siva and Siva lovingly returned to their respective abodes. O great O dear one, thus my own incarnation has been narrated to you. It is always pleasing and heightening the power of Siva.

61. He who listens to or narrates, reads or teaches the incarnation of Nandin, the granting of the boons, the coronation and the nuptial ceremony with faith and devotion enjoys all pleasures here and attains great goal hereafter.

# CHAPTER EIGHT

# (Bhairaua incarnation)

Nandifvara said: O Sanatkumara, omniscient one, listen to the story of Bhairava by listening to which alone, devotion to Siva becomes firm and steady.

1. Bhairava is the prior form of Siva, the great soul. Fools who are deluded by Siva’s Maya do not know about it.

2. O Sanatkumara, neither Vi?nu of four arms nor Brahma of four faces knows the greatness of lord Siva.

3. There is nothing to be surprised at in this. Siva’s Maya is inscrutable. Deluded by it people do not even worship him, the great lord.

4. If any one knows him the supreme soul, he alone is lord Siva. But then, none of these people know him out of their own will.

5. Although lord Siva is omnipresent he is not seen by the people of deluded intellect. He is known as a mere lord, he who is beyond the reach of minds and words.

# 7.

O great sage, in this connection I shall narrate an ancient legend. O dear one, listen to it with faith. It is the great cause of perfect knowledge.

# 8.

As Brahma was stationed on the wonderful and beautiful summit of Meru, all the celestial sages approached him with a desire to know the real truth.

# 9.

All the great sages with palms joined in reverence and shoulders drooping down came there and bowed to Brahma. They asked him respectfully. The celestial sages said:

# 10.

O lord of gods, O lord of subjects, O Creator, leader of the worlds, tell us the real fact. What is that sole unchanging entity?

Nandifvara said:

# 11.

Deluded by the Maya of great lord and not knowing the great fact the lotus-born Brahma replied haughtily. Brahma said:

# 12.

O gods, sages, all of you listen with attention and intelligence! I shall describe the great unchanging entity as it really is.

# 13.

I am the womb (material cause) of the universe, the creator, the self-born, the unborn, the lord, the primordial being, the Brahman, the sole unsullied soul.

# 14.

O excellent gods, I am the instigator of the worlds, and the deterrent too. There is none greater than I or any other who causes their revolution.

Nandxivara said: was O Vi?nu

# 15.

While the Creator saying thus, sage, who was there became angry as he too was deluded by Maya. He spoke these words derisively.

# 16.

O Brahma, this is not proper. It is sheer foolishness on the part of a practiser of Yoga. Without knowing the great reality, this is being mentioned in vain.

# 17.

I am the Creator of all the worlds, the great Atman, the greatest Purusa, the sacrifice, the lord Nfirfiyapa, the master of Maya and the greatest goal.

18. O Brahma, it is at my behest that creation is carried on by you. Without regard for me, the lord, no life can exist in the worlds.

19. O sage, thus starting a mutual clash due to delusion and desiring to conquer each other they asked the Vedas about truth.

20. The Vedas were there in embodied form. They shall be specifically asked. With this idea in mind they asked the four Vedas about the truth.

Brahma and Vifnu said:

21. Vedas are the authorities everywhere. They have been honoured everywhere. Hence you please say unreservedly. What is the sole unchanging entity?

Nandiivara said:

22. On hearing their words, the Vedas spoke in reality after remembering the lord.

23. “If we are honoured, O deities as the causes of creation and maintenance, we shall cite authorities that will dispel your doubts.

Nandiivara said:

24. On hearing the conditions mentioned by Vedas the two deities told the Vedas “What is mentioned by you is acceptable to us as authority. What is that entity? Please tell us that.

$gveda said:

25. That in which the Bhutas stay, that from which everything comes out, what they call as the greatest entity that is Rudra alone.

Tajurvsda said:

26. The lord who is worshipped by means of all sacrifices and meditation, whereby we have an authority—that sole seer of all is Siva.

S&#x26;maveda said:

27. That by which this universe whirls, that which is

meditated upon by Yogins, the light whereby the universe is illuminated— that Tryambaka alone is the greatest.

Atharvaveda said:

28. They call that sole being Siva who is beyond all misery who is the lord of gods whom the people who have the blessing of devotion see.

Nandisvara said:

29. After hearing what was thus said by the Vedas, Brahma and Visnu, deluded very much by the Maya (and hence) crooked in consciousness smiled and said to the Vedas.

Brahma and Visnu said:

30. O Vedas, what is this that you all speak without sense? What has happened to you? All wisdom is utterly lost now.

31-32. The lord of Pramathas incessantly sports with Siva. He is naked and of yellow colour and tawny due to dust. His dress and features are ugly. He has matted hair and moves about on his bull. He wears serpents as his ornaments. How can he be the supreme Brahman? Where is that Brahman free from any attachment?

33. On hearing their words, the all-pervasive Pranava who though unembodied assumed an embodied, extensive form told them thus.

Pranava said:

34. Lord Ha, Rudra, Siva indulging in sports and assuming various forms never sports about with the Sakti different from him.

35. The great lord, is self-luminous and eternal. Siva is his Sakti in the form of Bliss, not a chance occurrence.

Nandisvara said:

36. Even after this explanation the ignorance of Brahma and Visnu was not quelled. It was due to the Maya of Siva alone.

37. Then a great flame manifested itself in their

# Satarudrasarhhita

midst. It filled the space between the heaven and the sarth by means of its splendour.

38. O sage, then Brahma and Vijnu saw a shape in the form of a man in the middle of the mass of flame. Its body was huge and wonderful.

39. The fifth head of Brahma burnt with rage (as though saying) “who is this bearing a man’s outline and features in our midst?”

40-41. By the time Brahma could reflect properly, the great Being was seen immediately as the three-eyed Nilalohita with the trident in his hand and an eye in the forehead. Serpents and crescent moon constituted his ornaments. The deluded Brahma on seeing him said laughingly. Brahma said:

O 42-43. €tO Nilalohita, I know you. Do not be afraid; moon-crested one. You, Rudra, came out formerly from my forehead. Since you cried, the name Rudra was also assigned to you by me formerly. O son, seek refuge in me alone. I shall save you.

Nandifvara said:

44. O sage, on hearing the haughty words of the lotus-born Brahma, Siva became angry as if out for destruction.

45. Angrily, he created a Puru?a Bhairava blazing in great brilliance. Then he spoke lovingly.

Siva said:

46. O Kalabhairava, at the outset this lotus-born Brahma shall be chastised by you. You shine like god of death, hence you are KalarSja.

47. You are called Bhairava because you are of terrifying features and you are capable of supporting the universe. Since even Kala is afraid of you, you are called Kalabhairava.

48. When you are angry you will be suppressing the wicked souls. Hence you will be known everywhere as the suppressor of the wicked.



---


49. Since you will be devouring the sins of devotees in a trice your name will be famous as sin-eater.

50. O Kalaraja, you will have forever the suzerainty over my city Ka$I, the city of liberation which is greater than all other cities.

51. You alone will be the chastiser of those who commit sins there. Citragupta will write down their auspicious and inauspicious activities.

Nandlivara said:

52. After receiving all these boons, Kala-Bhairava, in a trice, cut off Brahma’s head with the tip of the nails of the fingers of his left hand.

53. The limb that commits offence shall be chastised. Hence the fifth head that censured was cut off.

54. On seeing Brahma’s head cut off, Vi?nu became terribly afraid. Devotedly he repeated the Satarudriya mantras and eulogised Siva.

55. The frightened golden-wombed Brahma too performed the Japa of Satarudriya. O sage, thus, in an instant, both of them were divested of their pride.

56. But they realised that Siva is the Supreme Brahman with Sat (Existence) Git (knowledge) and Ananda (Bliss) as the characteristics. He is the great Atman and transcends the attributes.

57. O omniscient Sanatkumara, listen to my extremely auspicious advice. As long as there is pride, perfect knowledge lies excessively hidden.

58. Eschewing false prestige and pride, a man realises lord Siva. Lord Siva quells the arrogant because he is the destroyer of arrogance.

59. Coming to know that Brahma and Vi?nu had been deprived of their pride, lord Siva the great god became delighted and the lord assured them of his protection.

25. Vs(Ch 8) speaks of Bhairava's attempt to cut off the fifth head of Brahma at the instance of Siva and also of the cancellation of that attempt by the intervention of Siva at the behest of Vi?nu. The present account of Satarudra Saṁhitā is somewhat different from the above account. Here Kālabhairava is mentioned to have severed the fifth head of Brahma with the nails of his left finger. This account is substantiated by similar accounts in the other Purāṇas.

Saiarudrasartihitd 1103

60. After consoling both of them, the delighted Siva, favourably disposed towards his devotees, spoke to Bhairava - his own other form.

Lord Sim said:

61. This Vi?nu shall be honoured by you as well as by Brahma, O Nilalohita, hold the skull of Brahma as an atonement.

62. Show to the world the rite of expiation for removing the sin of slaying brahmin. You beg for alms by resorting to the rite of skull.

63. After saying this and creating a virgin renowned as “Brahmahatya" even as he was watching, Siva, in the form of mass of flame, spoke thus.

64. Until she goes to the divine city of Varanasi you too shall follow her for a terribly long period.

65. You will have free access to everywhere except the city of Varanasi. When she goes to Varanasi you can be freed of her in a trice.

JfandiSoara said:

66. Thus directing the Brahmahatya, the wonderful lord Siva, vanished from the scene.

# {The sports of Bhairaoa}

bfandiivara said:

1. O omniscient SanatkumSra, listen lovingly to another story of Bhairava that destroys all defects and enhances devotion.

2. Due to Brahmahaty&#x26;’s presence Bhairava began to calculate the time for release. At the words of the lord of gods, he kept on the rite of K&#x26;p&#x26;lika.

3. He, the soul of the universe, roamed over the three worlds with the skull in his hand - The terrible Brahmahatya never left Bhairava.

4. Although he went to every holy centre, he was not left off by Brahmahatya. Let the greatness of Siva, the enemy of Kama, be understood thereby.

5. Once, while sporting about, being attended upon by Pramathas, Bhairava went as he pleased, to the abode of Vi$nu.

6-7. On seeing the three-eyed Bhairava of full size, born partially of lord Siva, with serpents for his ear-rings the Garuda-bannered Visnu fell prostrate on the ground like a staff. The gods, the sages and the womenfolk of the gods too did the same.

8. After bowing to him, pure in mind, and keeping the joined palms on his head, Visnu, the consort of Laksmi, eulogised him with various hymns.

9. The delighted Visnu being highly pleased in his mind, O great sage, joyously spoke to Laksmi, born at the time of the churning of the milky ocean and residing in the lotus.

Vi$nu said: “O lotus-eyed beloved, you are blessed, O comely sinless lady, gentle and beautiful with hips, I blessed, since we both see the lord of the universe.

10. He is the creator, the maintainer and the lord of the worlds. He is the primordial being, the lord and the refuge of all. He is calm and higher than the twenty-six principles.

11. He is omniscient, the lord of all Yogins, the sole leader of all Beings, the inner Atman of all living creatures and the bestower of everything to everyone always.

12. O Laksmi, see, he is that lord whom the quiet wakeful people, engrossed in breathless meditation, see in their heart of hearts through their mind.

13. Here he comes, the all-pervasive who is without.

15. Oh, wonderful indeed is the activity of the lord Siva, for he who repeats his names is freed from the bondage of the body that he has taken then.

16. On seeing him men do not obtain a rebirth in the world. Such a lord the moon-crested Tryambaka comes here.

17. O LaksmI, blessed indeed are my eyes as wide as the petals of a lotus, since by them the great god lord Siva is seen.

18. Fie upon the position of the gods where emancipation is not obtained, but on seeing Siva it is obtained and it puts an end to all miseries.

19. There is nothing more inauspicious than the state of the gods in the heaven that here even after seeing the lord of the gods all of us do not obtain salvation.

Nandifvara said:

20. After saying this, Visnu bowed to the great lord with the thrill of delight through pleasure and spoke this to the bull-bannered deity?

Vifnu said:

21. O lord, O unchanging one, O queller of all sins, what is this being done by you the omniscient lord of the gods and the creator of the worlds?

22. O lord of the gods, O three-eyed intelligent one this is only your sport. O Virupak?a, O suppresser of Kama, what is this activity of yours motivated by?

23. O lord Siva, O lord of Sakti, why do you go a-begging? O lord of the universe, this is my doubt, O bestower of the kingdom of the three worlds!

Nandttvara said:

24. Thus addressed by Vi§nu, lord Siva, the destroyer of the worlds of ferocious form of wonderful sports, laughingly said to Vi«m.

Bhairava said:

# 25.

Brahma's head was cut off with the top of the nail of my fingers. It is to remove that sin that I am observing this auspicious sacred rite.

PfandUvara said:

# 26.

Thus addressed by Siva, Bhairava, the lord of Lakfmi remembered something and bent down his head. He spoke again.

Vifnu said:

# 27.

“O great god, O remover of obstacles, sport all about as you please. But it does not behove you to envelop me with your Maya.

# 28.

O lord, it is true that from within the lotus from my navel, crores of lotus-seated Brahmas have come out in the different Kalpas through the power of Yoga.

# 29.

O lord, please eschew this Maya very difficult to be crossed by those who have no control over themselves. Brahma and others are deluded by your Maya. O

# 30.

O Siva, O lord of all, O goal of the good, lord of Siva, it is due to your own blessing that I am able to follow your activity.

# 31-32.

When the time of dissolution comes, destroyer of the world, you annihilate all the gods, sages and people of all castes and stages of life. O great god, then, the sin of slaying brahmins and others does not affect you. You are not bound by these and are quite independent. You sport as you please.

# 33.

O Siva, the garland of the bones of Brahma shines around your neck. Similarly, O Siva, O sinless one, the primordial Brahmahatya has followed you.

# 34.

Even after committing a great sin, if a person remembers you who are the lord and support of the worlds, his sin is quelled.

# 35.

Just as darkness does not stand in the presence of the sun, similarly the sin of your devotee does not stand but is wasted away.

# 36.

If a pious soul contemplates on the lotus-like pair

of your feet, even his sin of brahmin-slaughter become s wasted away.

37. O lord of the universe, if a person is devoted to uttering your name, his sin as weighty as the peak of a mountain does not overwhelm him.

38. O great soul, O ultimate abode, O god that assumest a body at your own sweet will, this is only a fancy of yours, this miserliness and dependence.

39. O lord of gods, I am blessed. I am seeing the eternal supreme god of cosmic form whom even Yogins do not see.

40. I have the greatest of gains today. I have the most auspicious of signs today. Even heaven and emancipation are as insignificant as a blade of grass to me who am contented with the nectar of seeing him.

41. When Govinda was saying this, Padma offered the desired alms into his begging bowl.

42. Lord Siva, who had assumed the body of Lord Bhairava, left the place joyously for begging elsewhere.

43. On seeing Brahmahatya following him, Visnu called her and requested “Please stop pursuing the Trident-bearing deity.”

Brahmahatya said:

44. Under this pretext, I am waiting upon the bull-bannered deity. Thus I shall sanctify myself for the annihilation of a rebirth.

Nandtfvaia said:

45. Though urged by Vi?nu she did not leave his side. The smiling Siva of Bhairava form, spoke these words to Vi?nu.

Bhairava said: O

46. O lord of Lak?mi, bestower of honour, I am satisfied by drinking the nectar of your words. Whatever you say is natural to good-natured persons.

47. O Vi?nu, choose your boon, O sinless one, I am the granter of boons. O Vi?$u, you are free from aberrations and are the foremost among my devotees.

48. Mendicants suffering from the fever of begging do not turn mad with the good articles of alms so much as by the drinking in of the nectar of honour.*

Nandiivara said:

49. On hearing the words of high-souled Bhairava, Visnu became delighted and spoke to him.

Vifnu said:

50. O lord of gods, this itself is a great favour that I see you who being the lord of the gods are inconceivable by mind and speech.

51. O Siva, this is like a shower of nectar without clouds. I am jubilant over this; thy benign glance to the good is a treasure easily acquired by them.

52. O lord Siva, let me never be detached from your feet; this is the favour I seek, nothing else.

Lord Bhairava said:

53. “O dear, O intelligent one, let what you have said occur. You will be the granter of boons to all the gods.”

jsfandUvara said:

54. Blessing Visnli moving in the central mountain Meru²⁸ and the world, the lord went to the city of the liberated, Varanasi.

55. As soon as Bhairava of terrible features entered the holy centre, Brahmahatya felt aggrieved and entered the nether worlds.

56. The skull of Brahma fell on the ground suddenly from the lotus-like hand of Bhairava. The holy centre then became Kapalamocana.

57. On seeing the skull of Brahma falling from his hand, even as everyone was watching it, Rudra danced with great joy.

58. The unbearable skull of Brahma did not leave his hand as he was roaming elsewhere but it fell down in a trice at Ka£i.

28. The mount Meru, situated in the centre of the earth, is the common resort of Vippu, Indra and other gods.

59. Brahmahatya which did not leave Siva at any other place vanished in a moment at Kali. Hence Kali shall be resorted to for shedding off evil.

60. If a person remembers the excellent holy centre Kapalamocana at Kali, his sin committed here and elsewhere becomes quelled immediately.

61. After coming to the foremost of holy centres, performing the ablution in accordance with the rules and by making the water-offering to the manes one is rid of Brahmahatya.

62. Bhairava stood facing the holy centre of Kapalamocana, devouring the series of sins of devotees.

63. It was on the eighth day in the dark half of the month of Margalirsa that lord Siva, the favourite of the good and indulging in auspicious sports, manifested himself in the form of Bhairava.

64. The person who observes fast on the eighth day of the dark half of the month of Margalir$a in front of Kalabhairava and also keeps awake at night is freed from great sins.

65. He who performs that rite with devotion even elsewhere and also keeps awake is rid of great sins and attains the goal of the good.

66. The sin committed by persons in the course of countless millions of births is quelled entirely on seeing Kalabhairava.

67. He who commits offence against the devotees of Kalabhairava is deluded and becomes miserable. He will attain the distress of the wicked people.

68. The devotees of lord Siva, who do not show devotion for Kalabhairava, attain great sorrow and especially so at Kali.

69. The man who, while staying at Varanasi, neglects the worship of Bhairava acquires sins that multiply like the moon in the bright half.

70. If a person neglects the worship of Kalaraja at Kali on every Tuesday and Bhutatfami day, his merit decreases like the moon in the dark half.

71. A person is rid of all sins on hearing this narrative of “Bhairava’s nativity” which can quell even Brahmahatya.

# CHAPTER TEN

# (The narrative of Man-lion)

NandiSvara said

1. The destroyer of Dak$a’s sacrifice Virabhadra shall be known as an incarnation of lord Siva, the great soul.
2. His narrative has been mentioned in the episode of Sati. You too have heard it several times. Hence it is not mentioned in detail.
3. O excellent sage, now by my affection to you I shall narrate the Sardula incarnation of lord Siva, Listen.
4. For the benefit of the gods, the wonderfully divine form of a Sarabha (the mythological animal with eight legs and capacity of killing lions) of blazing fire-like lustre was assumed by lord Siva.
5. O excellent sages, Siva’s incarnations are countless and conducive to the benefit of good devotees. Their number cannot be counted or specified.
6. 6-7. The number of the stars in the sky, of the sand particles on the earth and of the bursting showers of heavy rain can be specified by intelligent persons at some time in the course of many births over many Kalpas; but not of the incarnations of Siva; know my words to be true.
7. Still in accordance with my intelligence I shall mention, exactly as I had heard, the divine story of the Sarabha, portending great prosperity.
8. O sage, when Jaya and Vijaya were cursed by you, they became the sons of Diti and Kalyapa.
9. Those two attendants; the celestial sages were born as Diti’s sons. The elder was Hiranyaka$ipu and the younger was Hiranyfik^a the very powerful.
10. Formerly lord Vi?nu was requested by Brahma to



---


uplift the Earth. He assumed the form of a boar and slew Hiragyakja.

12. O sage, on hearing that his heroic brother, as dear to him as his very vital breath, was killed, Hiranyakaiipu became furious with Vi?nu.

13. He performed penance for ten thousand years and propitiated Brahma from whom he obtained the desired boon. “None of your creations shall kill me.”

14. He left for Sonita. He challenged the gods everywhere. He put the three worlds in his control and had an unrivalled rule over it.

15. O sage. Hiranyakaiipu harassed the gods and the sages. He violated all virtuous rites. He oppressed brahmins and became a sinner.

16. When the king of the Daityas hated his own son Prahlada, Visnu became his particular enemy.

17. O sage, Vi$nu then came out from a pillar in the hall, at dusk in the body of a man-lion, with great fury,

18. O great sage, the body of the man-lion was very terrible in every respect. It blazed frighteningly and terrified the leading Daityas.

19. The Daityas were killed in a trice by the man-lion. Hiranyakagipu fought a terrible battle.

20. O excellent sages, a great fight ensued between them for some time. It was terrifying, frightening and caused horripilation to everyone.

21. The lord of gods, lord of Lak$ml, the man-lion dragged the leading Daitya to the threshold even as the gods were watching in the sky.

22. While the gods were watching he placed the daitya on his lap and immediately tore open his stomach with his claws and killed him.

23. When Hiranyakaripu was killed by the man-lion Vi$nu, the whole universe attained normalcy and peace. But the gods did not derive any special comfort.

24. The celestial drums were sounded. On seeing the wonderful form of Vi$nu, Prahlada was surprised, Lak?m! was in a state of suspense.

99. See P. 1027 note.



---


# 25.

Though the lord of daityas was killed, yet the gods did not derive any pleasure. The fiery fury of the man-lion did not subside.

# 26-27.

The entire universe was again excited by that fiery splendour. The gods were miserable. Saying “What will happen now?” they kept themselves at a safe distance from fear. The lotus-born deity and others were excited by the fiery fury of the man-lion.

# 28.

They sent Prahlada near Visnu in order to subside his anger. At the behest of all in a body Prahlada approached the man-lion.

# 29.

The man-lion, the store-house of mercy, embraced him. The heart became cool, still the flame of fury did not subside.

# 30.

When it did not subside, the afflicted and miserable gods sought refuge in Siva.

# 31.

Going there, Brahma, other gods and the sages eulogised Siva for the happiness of all the worlds. The gods said:

# 32.

O great lord of gods, favourably disposed to those who seek refuge, save us the gods who have sought refuge in you as well as all the worlds.

# 33.

Obeisance be to you, O Sadasiva. Whenever there had been misery formerly, it was you that saved us.

# 34.

The ocean was churned and the gems were shared by the gods. Then O Siva, poison was taken by you.

# 35.

We were saved by you, O lord and you became famous as Nilakantha (Blue-necked). If you had not drunk the poison then, everything would have been reduced to ashes.

# 36.

This is well known, O lord, that whenever a person is in misery, by repeating your very name the misery is quelled. O Sadasiva, we are now afflicted by the fiery fury of the man-lion; lord, it is certain that you are competent to quell it.

# 30.

The incident relates to the legend of Siva’s swallowing poison that emerged at the churning of the ocean as a result of which Siva became blue-throated and was called Nilakantha.

2. Thereafter Rudra remembered the powerful Virabhadra, the cause of dissolution and addressed Bhairava, his own form.

3-5. Then suddenly there came the leader of the Ganas laughing loudly and accompanied by the leading Ganas laughing boisterously and jumping about here and there. He was surrounded by crores of fierce man-lion-formed Ganas, madly dancing heroes joyously leaping about. The warlike heroes Brahma and others were playing about as if with balls; the leader of the Ganas was surrounded by others too who had remained unseen. He was respected by the heroes.

6. He had a fiery splendour as fierce as the fire at the end of Kalpa. His three eyes shone splendidly. He had no weapon. He had matted hair. He was bedecked by the refulgent crescent moon.

8. With his fierce hissing whooping sound he deafened the faces of the quarters. He was as dark as the blue cloud and collyrium. He was terrible and wondrous with full grown moustaches and beards.

9. He was whirling his trident of unsplit lustre like a piece of musical instrument over and over again. The lord VIrabhadra arrived with his fully expanded heroic strength.

10. He said to Siva, “O lord of the universe, why have I been remembered by you? Please do me a favour and command me.”

Jsfandttvara said:

11. On hearing the words of VIrabhadra, and glancing at his face respectfully, lord Siva, the chastiser of the wicked, said lovingly.

Siva said:

12. An untimely terrible fear has cropped up for the gods. The fire of that man-lion is blazing. You shall quell this inaccessible one.

13. At the outset convince him in a consoling manner. If he does not subside thereby, show my great terrible form.

14. O VIrabhadra, at my behest, bring me his head and hide after quelling his subtle fury with your subtle one and his gross splendour with your gross one.

Nandifvara said:

15. Urged thus, the leader of the Ganas, assumed a calm body and features and hastened to the place where the man-lion was sitting.

16. Then VIrabhadra, the destroyer, addressed Vi$nu. Siva then spoke to him as a father speaks to his own son.

VIrabhadra said:

17. O lord Vi^nu, you have taken the incarnation for the happiness of the universe. You, the great lord, have been entrusted with the task of maintaining the universe by Siva.

18. Formerly, multitudes of creatures moving about in the one vast ocean have been split by your lordship in the form of a fish by binding them with your tail.

19. You support the earth in the form of a tortoise. You lifted it up in the form of a boar. In the form of a lion Hiranyaka£ipu has been killed.

20. Again in the form of a dwarf, you had bound Bali. You are the origin of all living beings. You are the eternal lord.

21. Whenever any misery torments the world you incarnate yourself and make it free from distress and ailment.

22. O Visnu, there is none else devoted to Siva more than you or even equal to you. The Vedas and sacred rites have been established by you towards an auspicious goal.

23. That Danava HiranyakaSipu has been killed for which purpose you have taken this incarnation. Prahlada too has been saved.

24. O lord Narasimha, O soul of the universe, subdue this extremely terrible body yourself in my presence.

NandiSvara said:

25. Urged thus with quiet peaceful words of Virabhadra, the arrogant man-lion assumed a more terrible anger.

26. O sage, threatening the heroic Virabhadra with his curved fangs he spoke harsh and terrible words.

The Man-lion said:

27. Go back the way you have come from. Do not speak offending words. I am now going to annihilate the universe of the mobile and immobile beings.

28. The annihilation is not the withdrawal of myself by myself or through others. I have my sway everywhere. There is none to rule over me.

29. Everything functions fearlessly by my favour, I am the instigator as well as the restrainer of all powers.

30. O leader of the Ganas, whatever is endowed with magnificence, whatever is glorious and powerful, know that to be my expanded splendour.

31. They know me, the knower of the reality of the

divinity, as the greatest. Brahmi, Indra and other gods are powerful in as much as they are my own parts.

32. Brahma, the creator of the universe who was formerly born of my umbilical lotus81 is greater than all, being independent, maker, remover and the lord of all.

33. This is my greatest glory. What else do you wish to hear again? Hence seek refuge in me and return to your abodes being freed from feverish ailment.

34. O lord of Ganas, know that the entire universe of this nature, is my own; this universe including the gods, Asuras and human beings is the manifestation of my greatness.

35. I am Kala, the cause of destroying the worlds. I am engaged in annihilating the worlds. O Virabhadra, know me to be the Death of Death. These gods are alive by my very favour.

Nandihara said:

36. On hearing the arrogant words of Visnu, Virabhadra of immeasurable exploits laughed and said contemptuously with throbbing lips.

Virabhadra said:

37. Don’t you know the Pinaka-bearing lord of the universe as the annihilator? Baseless argument and disputation will end in death for you.

38. What other incarnation of yours is left still to be taken32 with that whatever it may be you will remain alive only in the story.

39. Tell me the defect which has led you to this plight. With that lord capable of annihilation you will get the balance of Dak$ina.

40. You are Prakyti and Rudra is Puru$a. The semen is deposited in you. The five-faced Brahma was born of your umbilical lotus.

31. Hindu Mythology represents BrahmS as springing from the navel of Visnu or from a lotus which grew thereout. Hence Brahm&#x26; is called n&#x26;bhija, ‘navel-born.’ See Dowson; HM.

32. The Contents of the verses 21, 29, 30 and 35 in this chapter are reminiscent of similar ideas expressed in the Bhagavad-gltft.

42. Siva came out of his forehead. I am the ornament of the lord of gods in the form of Bhairava in the matter of creation.

43. O Visnu, I have been engaged in subduing you either through humility or through force, by Rudra the lord of gods, the lord of all.

44. After tearing to pieces a single demon you roar by your arrogance. Actually you are free from slumber only because you are endowed with a digit of his power.

45. Help rendered to good men is accepted as conducive to happiness. Help rendered to bad men is conducive to offence.

46. O Nrsimha, if you consider lord Siva as a mere living being you are ignorant, very arrogant and full of aberrations in every respect.

47. O base Nrsimha, you are neither creator, nor sustainer, nor annihilator. You are subservient and deluded in mind. You are not independent anywhere.

48. O Visnu, like the potter’s wheel you are forcibly induced by Siva when you take the different incarnations. You are always dependent on him.

49-50. Your skull, left by you in the midst of the necklace of Siva, while you had assumed the form of a tortoise, is still there. None who is burnt is bound. Is it your partial forgetfulness that in your body as a Boar your fangs were felled by the slayer of Taraka?

51. You were burnt by the fire of the Trident, O Visvaksena. At the time of Daksa’s sacrifice your head was cut off by me brilliant in form.

52. O Visnu, the fifth head of Brahma your son, which was cut, has not been set right even now. It is forgotten by you.

33. This verse as well as the fourth foot of the previous verse is defective.

Whatever worlds I have seized, in them, you lie down in the ocean, overcome by sleep. How can you then be a Sattvika?

# 56.

From you to a blade of grass, everything expands and develops only through Rudra’s power. Professing to possess power you have been deluded by the fire all round.

Ordinary man is incapable of seeing the greatness of his splendour. That is the greatest of the regions of Vi^nu which only the people of subtle intellect can perceive.

Lord Siva manifests himself in between heaven and earth, Indra and Agni, Yama and Varuna, in the heart of darkness and in the light of the moon.

You are Kala but lord Siva is Mahakala and Kalakala. Hence you will be death of death only through Siva’s digit.

Sanatkumara said: O NandHvara, intelligent one, this is understood. Take pity on me and tell me now lovingly what happened thereafter.

Nandiivara said:

1. Thus admonished by Vlrabhadra, the Man-lion became furious. He roared and began to seize him with force.

2. In the meantime, the splendour of Siva rose up unbearably enveloping the sky all around. It was terrible and cause for imminent fear.

3-4. Then in a trice the form of Vlrabhadra became invisible. The splendour of Lord Siva was neither golden nor fiery, neither lunar nor solar. It resembled neither the lightning nor the moon. It was beyond comparison. The forms of brilliance were merged in Siva.

5. That great splendour was not of the sky too. Thereafter its middle became clearly manifested in the form characteristic of Rudra of deformed shape.

6. Even as all the gods stood watching with the auspicious shouts of victory, Lord Siva became manifest in the form of the Annihilator.

7. He had a thousand hands and wore matted hair. His head was adorned by the crescent moon. He appeared like a bird with wings and beak. His body was fierce and fully developed.

8. His fangs were very sharp. Adamantine claws were his weapons. His neck was black in colour. He had huge arms and four legs. He was blazing like fire.

9. His voice was resonant and terrible like the rumbling sound of the clouds that gather at the end of a Yuga. His three eyes were as wide and blazing as the fire of the evil spirit of great fury, and were clearly visible.

10. His fangs producing a hissing sound of Humkara. Siva of such a form appeared in sight.

At his very vision Visnu lost his strength and exploit. He assumed a lustre of the flickering glow-worm beneath the sun.

Fluttering with his wings, and tearing the navel legs he bound the legs of the Man-lion with his tail and his hands with his own hands. He struck his chest, caught hold of Visnu. It expanded in the sky along with the gods and the sages.

# 15-16

Like a vulture seizing a serpent he fearlessly caught hold of Visnu, lifted him up and fell him to the ground. At the time of flight he was excessively oppressed, being hit with the wings. Then Lord Siva took Visnu and flew up.

# words 17

All the gods followed him eulogising him with the obeisance. Brahma and other sages bowed to him with reverence and love.

# 18

Being led thus Visnu was helpless. His face was pallid and sorrowful. With palms joined in reverence he eulogised Lord Siva with prayers of simple words.

# names 19

After eulogising Mrda with the hundred and eight names of the lord, Nrsimha requested lord Sarabha again. “O great lord, whenever my ignorant mind be defiled by arrogance, it shall be removed by you alone.”

NandUvara said:

# 21

Thus saying with love to Siva, the Man-lion turned submissive and bowed to him. Visnu was utterly defeated and came to the end of his life.

# body 22

Within a trice Virabhadra made his powerful powerless and dead.

Nandifvara said:

# 23

Then Brahma and other gods eulogised lord Siva who had assumed the form of a Sarabha and who was the sole benefactor of all the worlds.

# The gods said:

Visnu and Indra, the sun and others, the gods and Asuras and you alone devour them.

26. Since you annihilate the world, you are called Hara by the learned. Since Visnu was curbed and caught hold of by you, you are called Hara by the learned.

27. Since you support and hold everything after dividing your body into eight, O lord, protect us, the gods, by means of the desired gifts.

28. You are the great Purusa, Siva, lord of all, leader of the gods, the soul of the indigent, of a mind without aberrations. You are the great Brahman, the goal of the good.

29. You are the kinsman of the distressed, the ocean of mercy, of wonderful sports, the vision of the great soul, the intelligent, the Immense Cosmic Being, the all-pervasive, the truth, the Existence, knowledge and Bliss as the characteristics.

Nandttvara said:

30. On hearing these words of the gods, Siva, the great God, spoke to the gods and the great ancient sages.

31. Just as water poured into water, or milk poured into milk, or ghee poured into ghee becomes one with those things, so also Visnu is merged into Siva, not otherwise.

32. It was Visnu alone in the form of the Man-lion, haughty and strong, engaged in the activity of annihilating the universe.

33. He shall be prayed and bowed by my devotees aspiring achievements. He is the foremost of my devotees and the granter of boons.

Nandttvara said:

34. After saying this, the lordly king of birds of great strength, vanished there itself even as all the gods were watching.

35. Lord Virabhadra, the leader of the Ganas, of great strength, peeled off the hide of the Man-lion and went to the mountain taking it with him.

37. Then the gods freed from their distress began to sing the glory of this story. With their eyes blooming with wonder they returned the way they came.

38. He who reads or listens to the great narrative which being sacred has the flavour of the Vedas, will realise all his desires.

39. This narrative is conducive to wealth, fame, longevity and health. It increases prosperity, subdues obstacles and quells ailments.

40. It subdues misery, yields the fruits of desires and is the abode of auspicious features. It removes premature death, confers intelligence and destroys enemies.

41. This great form of Siva in the form of Sarabha shall be made public only among the leading devotees of Siva.

42. This shall be read and listened to only by them with their soul dedicated to Siva. It then confers the nine-fold devotion. It is divine. It purifies the inner mind and sense.

43. This shall be read during the festivals of Siva, during the eighth and fourteenth Tithis, and at the installation of the idol. It then causes the presence of Siva.

44-45. When there is danger from thieves, tigers, lions, one’s own or enemy kings, during commotions, earthquakes and robberies, dust storms, when there is the fall of meteors, when there is draught or too much of rain—during all these occasions he who reads this with purity becomes a great devotee of Siva steady in his rites and very learned.

46. He who reads or listens to this without any specific desire and performs the rites of Siva attains Rudra’s region and becomes a follower of Rudra.

47. O sage, after attaining Rudra’s region he rejoices with Rudra. Then he becomes one with Rudra by the mercy of Siva.

1. O son of Brahma, listen lovingly to the narrative of the moon-crested lord Siva how he was born willingly in the house of Vi£vanara. O

2. He was Grhapati by name. sage, he became the lord of Agniloka. The great lord, the soul of all, was fiery in form and brilliant too.

3. On the beautiful banks of Narmada in the city of Dharmapura, formerly there lived a devotee of Siva, a soul, the sage ViSvanara.

4. While in the stage of celibacy, he was devoted to Brahmayajfia rites. He belonged to the Sap^ilya lineage. He was pure, the storehouse of Brahminical splendour and had self-control.

5. He understood the real meaning of sacred lord. He followed the conduct of the virtuous. He was highly skilled in Siva ethics. He was the foremost among the knowers of worldly conventions.

6. After pondering over the good qualities of an ideal housewife, Vi£vanara married with due rites the daughter of Kala who was really worthy of him.

7. He maintained the sacrificial fires. He was devoted to the performance of the five daily sacrifices. He practised the six sacred rites everyday. He was fond of serving gods, manes and guests.

35. Dharmapura is a sacred Tlrtha situated on the northern bank of the Narmada river, 8 miles from Pag&#x26;rfi, near the confluence of the Kubj&#x26; and Narmadfi. It contains many temples and is supposed to be the Airama of the sage Dadhici who gave away his bones to the gods for their protection from the demons.

8. When a long time elapsed in that manner Sucismati the wife of that Brahmana who observed all rites spoke to her husband.

9. “O Lord, by your favour, all pleasures which women could expect have been enjoyed by me in your company. O Lord, a desire has been lurking in my heart still for a long time. If it is proper to all householders, you shall grant it to me.

ViSvdnara said:

11. O gentle lady of beautiful hips ever desirous of my welfare, what is there that cannot be granted to you? O lucky one, you may ask for it. I shall grant it to you without delay. O good woman, by the favour of Lord Siva, nothing is inaccessible to me either here or hereafter. Lord Siva is the cause of all good.

JVandifvara said:

13. On hearing these words of her husband she who thought her husband to be a deity was delighted. Joining her palms in reverence she humbly said.

Sucismati said:

14. O Lord, if I deserve a boon, if a boon is to be granted to me, please give me a son equal to Lord Siva. I am not choosing any other boon.

Jsfandiivara said:

15. On hearing her words that Brahmin of pure rites entered into mystic trance for a short while and thought in his heart thus.

16. ‘What is this? This lady has wished for an extremely inaccessible thing. It is beyond the reach of wishes. Let it be. Only He does everything.

17. It is by Siva himself stationing himself in her mouth in the form of speech that this has been said. This alone is possible. Who else could have endeavoured to say

18. After thinking like this, the sage Visvanara of liberal heart who strictly adhered to the principle of monogamy spoke to her.

19. After consoling his wife, the sage set out for penance to the city of Varana* where Lord Siva himself is stationed.

20. Reaching Varanasi immediately and seeing Manikarnika38, he was freed from three distresses acquired in the course of hundreds of births.

21. He saw VisveSvara and other phallic images. He performed ablutions in all holy ditches, wells, tanks and lakes.

22. He bowed to all Vinayakas and Sarva Gauri. He worshipped Kalaraja Bhairava who devours sins.

23. Strenuously he eulogised Dandanayaka and other Ganas, Adikesava and others. He propitiated Ke-iava.

24. He bowed to Lolarka and other suns again and again. Without lethargy he offered balls of rice in all the holy centres.

25. He satiated sages and brahmins by means of "feeding thousand" and other rites. With devotion he propitiated the phallic images of Siva by means of great worship and service.

26. He thought — “What that image that yields the result quickly? Where can the penance due to the longing for a son find ultimate rest.”

27. Thinking thus for a moment, the intelligent sage Visvanara praised the VIreSa form of Siva which confers the blessings of a son immediately.

28. Innumerable thousands of Siddhas have derived the fulfilment of their desire from the worship of Siva. Hence VireSa is famous as the fruit-yielding phallic image.

29. If any one worships the Viresvara phallic image for a year with great devotion he obtains longevity, cherished desires, sons and other things.

30. I too shall worship VireSa here thrice a day and shall ere long acquire a son as desired by my wife.

31. After thinking like this, the intelligent brahmin. It is a mailed pool in Yiiunasl.

the contented ViSvanara took a bath in the well Candrakupa and took the vow of the sacred rite.

32-34. For a month he lived on a single meal a day. For another month he took only the night-meal. He spent another month taking only the food he got without begging. He spent another month without any food. For another month he took only milk. For another month he took only fruits and vegetables. For another month he ate only a handful of gingelly seeds. For another month he took liquid diet. For another month he took only Paftcagavya. For another month he performed the Gandrayana rite. For another month he drank water from the tip of Ku£a grass and for another month he had air alone as his food.

35. Thus for a full year he performed the wonderful penance. He worshipped the excellent VIre$a thrice a day.

36-37. On the thirteenth month while he was going to VireSa after taking bath in the Gariga river very early in the morning, the sage saw a child of eight years smeared with ashes all over the body, in the middle of the phallic image.

38. The child had eyes as long as his ears. He had ruddy lips. He had matted hair of beautiful tawny colour. He was naked and had a smiling face.

39. He had all the dress and features proper to childhood. He seemed intelligent. He was reciting hymns from the Vedas. He was laughing sportively.

40. On seeing him he was joyous. He was thrilled all over the body. He uttered the formula to you over and over again.

41. The contented Vai£vanara eulogised Siva, the great bliss in the form of child by means of eight verses that gave expression to his desire.

Vifv&#x26;nara said:

42. The Brahman is alone without a second. It is true. Indeed there is no multitude of different things. There is only one Rudra. There is none second to him. Hence I seek refuge in you, the sole great lord.

# 43.

O Siva, you alone are the creator and annihilator of every thing. In the different forms you are of single form and formless. Just as the inner virtue is only one though it may seem to be many. Hence I do not resort to any one except you.

# 44.

The snake in the rope, the silver in the oyster shell, the water in the mirage — like that when he is known, the whole world vanishes and Sat alone remains. I resort to that great lord.

# 45.

Coolness in the water, heat in the fire, the scorching nature in the sun and the pleasing gentleness in the moon, fragrance in the flower and the ghee in the milk just, in that manner, O Siva, you are the essence in the world. Hence I resort to you.

# 46.

You the earless perceive sound; you the noseless perceive fragrance; you the footless come from far; you the eyeless see; you the tongueless perceive the taste. Who knows you really? Hence I seek refuge in you.

# 47.

O lord, even the Vedas do not know you directly, nor Visnu, nor the Creator of every thing, nor the leading Yogins, nor Indra and other gods. Only a devotee knows. Hence I seek refuge in you.

# 48.

You have no spiritual lineage; you are unborn; you are immortal, formless without any prescribed conduct or native land. Still you are the lord of three worlds and you fulfil all our desires. I worship you.

# 49.

Everything originates from you. You are all-in-all, enemy of Kama, you are the lord of Gauri; you are naked and quiescent; you are old, youthful and the child. Whatever is, you are that. There is no source of your origin. I bow to you.

pitiated by you I am very much delighted. Ask for the boon of your choice.

52. Then the delighted and contented sage ViSvanara stood up and replied to Siva who had assumed the form of a boy.

Viivanara said:

53. O lord Siva, what is it that is not known to you who are omniscient? You are lord Sarva the granter of everything and the immanent soul of all.

54. Why do you speak forcing me in the pity-provoking task of imploration? O lord Siva, after knowing this, please do as you wish.

Nandiivara said:

55. On hearing the upright words of ViSvanara of pure rites, the lord in the form of a child, spoke smilingly.

56. O pious one, the desire that you have cherished in your heart regarding Sucismati will be certainly realised ere long. O intelligent one, shall become your son in Sucismati. I shall be known as Grhapati, pure and loved by all gods.

57. The hymn of eight verses of desire Abhilasasjaka that you recited now, when recited thrice a day for a year in the vicinity of Siva will yield all desires.

58. The recitation of this hymn yields sons, grandsons and wealth. It is conducive to the mollification of everything and quells all mishaps.

59. It is the cause of acquisition of heaven, emancipation and prosperity. There is no doubt in this. This is on a par with all other hymns. It always yields every desire.

60. If an issueless man gets up early in the morning, takes his bath, worships Siva’s phallic image, recites this hymn and continues the practice for a year, he will surely secure a son.

61. The Abhila$a?taica hymn shall not be taught to common people. It shall be preserved carefully as a secret mantra. It makes the most barren lady deliver of a child.

Nandttvara said:

1. With great delight the brahmin returned home and told his beloved wife all those details.

2. On hearing it, §uci$mati, the wife of the brahmin, rejoiced much and being full of love she praised her good fortune.

3. She became pregnant in due course. The brahmin performed the rite of impregnation40 duly.

4. Before the stir and throb of the child in the womb was felt, the learned Brahmin performed the holy rite of Pumsavana41 in the manner prescribed in the Grhyasutras for the growth of embryo’s manliness.

5. Then in the eighth month he performed the holy rite of Slmanta42 which is conducive to the growth of the embryo and which facilitates easy delivery of the child.

40 Garbh&#x26;dbana or Garbhalambhana is a rite by the performance of which a woman receives semen scattered by her husband.

41 The rite of seeking a male child (Pumsavana) is performed in the third or fourth month of pregnancy or even later, on the day when the moon is on a male constellation on Ti$ya particularly.

42 In this rite the hairs of the pregnant woman are parted in the sixth or eighth month of pregnancy. This is done to ward off evil spirits who are bent on sucking the blood of the foetus.

6-9. Then at the conjunction of stars when Jupiter was in the centre, when the Lagna was auspicious, when the good planets stood in pairs, Siva, the giver of happiness to all, was born as the son of £uci$mati. His face resembled the moon. The lamps in the lying-in-chamber were dimmed by his bodily lustre. The lord, the destroyer of misfortunes and the bestower of happiness to the dwellers of the Earth, the nether worlds and the heaven was born as the son. The smoke exuding therefrom became the perfume to sweeten the breath of the quarters. The immense clouds showered flowers of pleasing fragrance. The divine drums were sounded and the quarters were brightened up.

10. The rivers became transparent as also the minds of living beings. The darkness of evil dwindled and the Rajas was stripped of its quality or of its dust.

11. The living creatures were endowed with Sattva quality. There was a shower of nectar. People began to talk sweet and pleasant words.

12-13. Rambha and other celestial damsels arrived with auspicious articles in their hands. Thousands of Vidyadharis, Kinnaris, Goddesses, the womenfolk of Gandharvas, serpents and Yaksas of sweet voice flocked singing auspicious songs.

14-20. The following sages came there: Marici, Atri, Pulaha, Pulastya, Kratu, Angiras, Vasitfha, KaSyapa, Agastya, Vibhanda son of Mancjavi, Lomasa, Romacarana, Bharadvaja, Gautama, Bhrgu, Galava, Garga, Jatukarna, Para£ara, Apastamba, Yajftavalkya, Dak?a, Valmiki, Mudgala, Satatapa Likhita, Silada, Sankha, Uficchabhuk, Jamadagni, Samvarta, Matahga, Bharata, Amsuman, Vyasa, Katyayana, Kutsa, Saunaka, Susruta, Suka, R?ya£fnga, Durvasas, Suci, Narada, Tumburu, Ut tanka, Vamadeva, Pavana, Asita, Devala, Salankayana, Harita, Visvamitra, Bhargava, Mrkundu with his son, Parvata, Daruka, Dhaumya, Upamanyu Vatsa and others came to the happy hermitage of Visvanara for the auspicious Santi ceremony.

Thousands of immobile beings came there in the forms of the mobile beings. During the great festivities then there was an untimely flood of moonlight.

# 24-25.

Brahma himself performed the postnatal rite4* after bowing to the infant. In consonance with his form and beauty he gave him the name44. of Grhapati on the eleventh day in accordance with injunctions, repeating the Vedic mantras.

# 26.

After conferring blessings on everyone by reciting the mantras from the four Vedas, Brahma left the place while riding on the swan.

# 27.

After affording proper safeguards for the child in accordance with worldly conventions Siva returned to his abode on his vehicle along with Visnu.

# 28-30.

The visitors praised the infant. They were at the height of their joy. They spoke in unison “O what a beauty! What a splendour! All the characteristic signs are there in all the limbs. How fortunate is &#x26;uci$mati! Siva himself is born. What is surprising in this? Siva has incarnated in all devotees. Siva has been worshipped by her.” Then they took leave of Visvanara and departed.

The eternal Veda says—A person conquers the worlds through a son. Hence all householders wish for a son.

# 32.

The house of a sonless person is a void. His earnings are futile. His penance is split. It is not holy due to the want of a son.

Both here and hereafter there is no better acquisition than a son; there is no better happiness than a son; there is no greater friend than a son.

35. The knower rites performed the Karnavedha rite48 under the constellation of Sravana. In order to enhance his brahminical splendour he made him perform an auspicious Vrata40 in his fifth year.

36. After celebrating the Upakarma rite, 60 the intelligent sage taught him the Vedas. The boy learned the Vedas for a year with their ancillaries. He learnt the Padapatha and Kramapatha of the Vedas.

37. Evincing his humility and other qualities, the competent youth grasped the lore almost by himself but formally through the preceptor just as a medium.

38. In his ninth year, Narada came there to see Grhapati, son of Visvanara, and found him engaged in serving his parents.

39. The divine sage reached the hut of Visvanara, received due hospitality and seated himself. Eagerly he enquired of his health.

40. He remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and mentioned to Visvanara the future fortune and activities of his son.

41-42. Narada said to the boy “O son of Visvanara come on. Sit on my lap. I shall study your characteristics. Show me your right hand.” On being thus addressed, the boy bowed to Narada after receiving the permission of his.

4> According to this Purana, the ceremony of taking the child out of the house is performed in the fourth month. But there is a wide option about the time of this samskara.

46. The rite of feeding the child for the first time is performed in the sixth, eighth, ninth, tenth or even at the expiry of a year. But the right occasion is when the child’s teeth come out.

47. The rite of shaving, cutting the hair and nails is performed to remove the impurities and impart good health. This is done at the end of first year or before the expiry of the third year.

48. The ceremony of boring the ears of the child is performed as precaution against hydrocele and hernia. Cp Susruta, Cikitsa 19. 21.

NandiSvara said:

43. Examining closely the palate, tongue etc. (of the boy) the intelligent Narada spoke to Visvanara, urged by Siva.

Narada said:

44. “O sage Visvanara, listen. I shall mention the detailed characteristic marks of your son. Your son bears good marks on every limb. He possesses all good signs.

45. But fate alone must guard this boy duly, this boy who has all good qualities, who is characterised by all good features and who is possessed of all pure digits in their entirety.

46. This child should be protected with all efforts. When the fate is adverse, even good qualities assume the state of defects.

47. In the twelfth month from now I suspect a great danger to him from lightning and fire.” After saying this Narada returned to heaven the way he had come.

# (The incarnation of Gfhapali)

Nandiivara said:

1. On hearing the revelation of Narada, Visvanara and his wife considered it a terrible bolt from the blue.

2. He shouted “O I am doomed!” He beat his chest. Excited by the grief about his son he fell into a great swoon.

3. The grief-stricken §uci§mati too lamented much. Her senses were benumbed and she lamented aloud.

4. On hearing her loud lamentation, Visvanara woke up from his swoon. He cried aloud “What is this? What is this? Where is Gfhapati my vital breath who stands

5. On seeing his parents excessively grieved, the boy Gfhapati, a part of Siva, smiled and said.

GrhaPati said:

6. O Mother, O Father, what is the reason? Please tell me now. Why do both of you cry? What and whence is such a fright for you?

7. Time and pitiable fickle existence cannot affect me, whose body is guarded by the dust-particles of your feet.

8. O my parents, please listen to my vow. If I am your true son, I will do that whereby death itself will be terrified.

9. I shall propitiate lord Siva, the conqueror of death, the omniscient and the bestower of all to the good. I shall perform the Japa of Mahakala. O parents, I am telling you the truth.

NandiSvara said:

10. On hearing his words the aged brahmin couple were freed of their distress by the untimely showers of nectar. They then spoke.

The brahmin couple said:

11. Say again. Say again. What is it? What is it? Speak again. Time and pitiable fickle existence will not affect you?

12. A great means has been suggested by you to dispel our distress, that of the propitiation of lord Siva, the conqueror of death.

13. The same is the result for those who seek refuge in Siva who dispels sins and does everything beyond the path of our desire. There is nothing better than this.

14. O dear, haven’t you heard that the slayer of the Tripuras protected, in days of yore, Svetaketu who was bound by the noose of Kala?

15. When Silada’s son was threatened by death, when he was only eight, Siva saved him and made him his own attendant as Nandin, the delighter of the whole universe.

16. He protected the three worlds by drinking off the terrible poison as fearful as the fire at the hour of dissolution, when it was produced at the churning of the milk-ocean.

17. With the wheel raised up by the line drawn with his beautiful toe he killed the haughty Jalandhara who had deprived the three worlds of their pleasure.

18. He burnt the Tripuras, who were haughty and deluded by their lordship of the three worlds, by means of the blazing fires emanating from the fall of a single arrow.

19. Even as Brahma and others were watching, he reduced Kama to ashes by a single glance, Kama whose strength had been enhanced by his conquest of the three worlds. O son, seek refuge that Siva, the amulet of protection of the universe, the sole creator of Indra, Acyuta, Brahma and others.

Nandttvara said: —

21. Thus he secured the permission of his parents. He bowed at their feet and circumambulated them. He then pacified them and started.

22-25. He reached Kasi inaccessible even to Brahma, Visnu and others. He reached Kasi that dispels all recurring distress, that is protected by Visvesa, that shines with the celestial river Ganga as with a necklace round its neck, that shines splendidly by the presence of Parvati, the consort of Siva and of wonderful qualities. After reaching Kasi he went to Manikarnika at the outset. After taking bath in accordance with the injunctions of the Sastras he saw Lord Visvesvara with palms joined and head bent in reverence. The intelligent brahmin was greatly delighted. He bowed to lord Siva who instils life into and protects the three worlds.

26. Seeing that phallic image of Siva again and again he was delighted in his heart and thought— “Undoubtedly this is possessed of great bliss.”

51. Installed at Varflgasl, Visvesvara is one of the twelve great phallic images of lord Siva. It has been for many centuries the chief object of worship. Its propitiation is said to result in the increase of material wealth and spiritual attainment.

27. Ha, there is none more blessed than I in the three worlds consisting of the mobile and immobile beings since today I have seen here the lord VhveSvara.

28. It is only to enhance my good fortune that sage Narada formerly came and told me that. I am therefore very much contented.

29-31. By the nectarine juice of bliss he concluded the sacred rite. Then on an auspicious day he installed the phallic image, the bestower of all benefits. He adopted austere rites difficult to be performed by those who have no control over themselves. He filled pots with the water of the Ganga strained and purified by means of a cloth. Every day he bathed the phallic image with hundred and eight potfulls of water. Then he put a garland of blue lotus round the deity.

32. He wreathed the garlands with a thousand and eight flowers. He ate fruits, roots and bulbous roots once in a fortnight or a month.

33. The courageous devotee spent six months by eating withered leaves. The remaining six months he spent drinking drops of water or simply breathing.

34. O Brahmins, thus a year in the life of that noble soul passed by, performing the penance with the devoted mind resting only in Siva.

35. In the twelfth year of his life, the thunderbolt-armed Indra approached him as if fulfilling the utterance of Narada. He said — “O brahmin, am Indra, I am delighted

36. at your holy rites. Ask for the boon you wish to have. I shall give you whatever desire you have in your mind.

37. On hearing the words of lord Indra, the son of the sage spoke these words boldly and sweetly. Grhapati said: O

38. “O Indra, enemy of Vritra, I know you as armed with the thunderbolt. I do not want a boon from you. Siva is the granter of boon to me.”

Indra said:

39. O child, Siva is pot separate from me. I am the

# Satarudrasarhhitd

lord of gods. Give up your foolhardiness and ask for a boon from me. Do not delay.

Grhapati said:

40. O Paramour of Ahalya52, O wicked one, O enemy of mountains, O chastiser of Paka, it is quite clear that I shall not ask any other god except Siva for a boon.

NandUvara said:

41. On hearing his words, Indra’s eyes turned red with fury. He raised his terrible thunderbolt and threatened the boy with dire consequences.

42. On seeing the thunderbolt with the flames of lightning, the boy remembered the words of Narada. He became frightened and fell into a swoon.

43. Then Siva, the lord of Parvati, the dispeller of darkness appeared in front. As though enlivening him with gentle strokings he said: “Stand up. Stand up. May good come up to you.”

44. Opening his eyes resembling the lotus that had gone to sleep at the end of the day and getting up, he saw Siva shining more brilliantly than hundred suns.

45-49. Seeing the lord with the eyes in the forehead, blue-necked, bull-bannered, moon-crested, with Parvati occupying the left side, shining with matted hair, armed with the trident and Ajagava bow, possessed of limbs shining white like camphor, clad in the elephant’s hide, he recognised the lord as the great God described in the Agamas and statements of his preceptor. He was delighted and he evinced the thrill of hair. For a moment he stood motionless like the mountain Citrakuta.* He forgot himself like a man suddenly becoming rich. He was unable to eulogise or bow down or plead for anything. Then Siva smiled and said.

Siva said: O child Grhapati, I know that you are frightened.

50.

52. The epithet speaks contemptuously of Indra. He is called the seducer of Ahalya—the wife of the sage Gautama, for which he was cursed by the sage. As a result of Gautama's imprecation Indra bore a thousand marks resembling a female organ which afterwards turned to eyes.

1138 of Indra with the thunderbolt in his lifted hand. Don’t be afraid, I only wanted to know your nature.

51. Neither Indra, nor the thunderbolt, nor even the god of death is powerful to molest my devotee. You have been terrified by me alone in the form of Indra.

52. O gentle one, I shall grant you the boon. I confer the title of Agni on you. I authorise you to grant boons to whatever deity you think fit.

53. O Agni, you will be moving in the midst of all mortals. Acquire kingship as the guardian of the quarter in the south-east.

54. The phallic image installed by you will be known by your name. It will be known as Agnlsvara and it will be conducive to the enhancement of all splendour.

55. The devotees of AgniSvara need not fear lightning and fire. They will never suffer from impaired digestion or premature death.

56. A person who worships Agnlsvara, the bestower of prosperity, at Varanasi, is honoured in the region of fire even if, by chance, he dies elsewhere.

Nandttvara said:

57. After saying this and fetching his kinsmen Siva crowned him as the guardian of the quarter. Even as the parents watched it, Siva entered his phallic image.

58. Thus, O dear, the incarnation of Siva as fire has been explained to you. This incarnation of Siva, the great soul, is famous as Gfhapati also.

59. The city of Gitrahotra is beautiful, pleasant and finely lustrous. Those who are devotees of fire stay there.

60. People of steady Sattvika quality and control over their sense-organs, who enter fire, or women endowed with Sattva quality become as lustrous as fire.

61. Brahmins performing Agnihotra regularly, Brahmacarins maintaining sacrificial fires, and those who stay amidst five fires become as splendrous as fire in the region of fire.

62. He who makes gifts of bundles of fuel during winter for alleviating chillness or he who makes fire-bricks (of cow-dung) stays with fire.

Satarudrasamhitd 1139

63. He who faithfully performs the rites of cremation for the unclaimed bodies or he who urges others to do so, himself being incapable, is honoured in the region of fire.

64. Fire alone is the greatest means of salvation for the brahmins. He is the preceptor, the lord, the sacred rite, the holy centre. Certainly everything is fire.

65. All unholy things become pure the moment they come into contact with fire. Therefore fire is called Purifier.

66. The fire is certainly the immanent soul of man. Even morsels of flesh it will digest in the stomach, but not the muscles of women.

67. The fiery form of Siva is in the form of the fire visible. Excepting this what else is seen as creative, protective and destructive?

68. Fire is the eye of the lord of the three worlds. In this world of pitch darkness what else than this becomes the illuminator?

69. The incense, the lights, the food offerings, milk, curd, ghee and sugarcane juice—all these go unto the dwellers of heaven when offered into the fire here.

# CHAPTER SIXTEEN

# (Siva's Incarnation as Yak$e$vara)

Nandttvara said:

1. O great sage, listen to the Yak$e$vara incarnation of Siva, that dispels the arrogance of the arrogant and lets the devotion of the good flourish.

2. Formerly, the powerful gods and the Daityas motivated by the desire to gain their selfish ends churned the milk ocean for achieving nectar.

3. When the churning of the milk ocean started as the gods and demons wanted nectar, poison blazing as the fire of dissolution came out at first.



---


# 4.

O dear, at the sight of it, the gods and the daityas were highly agitated and frightened. They fled from there immediately and sought refuge in Siva.

# 5.

After seeing Siva, the crestjewel of all the gods, all of them including Vi$nu devoutly bent their heads and bowed to Visnu with devotion.

# 6.

Then the delighted lord Siva favourably disposed to the devotees, quaffed off the terrible poison afflicting gods and Asuras.

# 7.

The lord retained obliquely the acute poison that he drank, in his neck. He shone much thereby and became Blue-necked.

# 8.

Released from the burning sensation of the poison thanks to the blessings of Siva, the gods and the Asuras began to churn again.

# 9.

O sage, many gems came out of it, but O sage, it was the nectar that the gods and the Danavas prized much.

# 10.

Not the Asuras, but the gods drank the nectar, thanks to the favour of Visnu. Then a great battle ensued between them inflicting pain on both.

# 11.

A mutual clash occurred between the gods and the Danavas, O sage. The moon was eclipsed by Rahu and fled in terror of Rahu.

# 12.

He went to the abode of Siva extremely agitated by fear and sought Siva’s protection. Saying “Protect me O Lord, protect me” he bowed to the lord and eulogised him.

# 13.

Lord Siva, the bestower of protection to the good, and favourably disposed to his devotees, wore the moon on his head as the latter had sought refuge.

# 14.

Then Rahu too, came there. He bowed to and eulogised lord Siva with reverence by means of sweet words.

# 15.

Realising his desire, Siva fixed on to his neck his head that had been formerly cut off by Vi$nu, and that was known as Ketu.

# 16.

Then the Asuras were defeated by the gods in the battle. By drinking nectar the gods had become powerful and gained victory.

17. Deluded by Siva’s Maya, Vi?nu and others became very haughty. Their strength began to take root and sprout within them.

18. O sage, then Lord Siva, the suppressor of arrogance, became a Yak$a. He hastened to the place, O sage, where the gods were stationed.

19. On seeing Vi?nu and all other gods arrogant in their minds, lord Siva, the lord of Yaksas and the suppressor of arrogance spoke. YakfeSvara said:

20. O ye gods, why have you all assembled here? What is your goal? Tell me the reason as I ask unto you. The gods said—

21. O lord, a terrible battle took place here wherein all the Asuras were killed. The few that remained fled away.

22. We are great heroes and powerful slayers of the Daityas. How insignificant in strength are those Daityas in front of us!

NandUvara said:

23. On hearing the arrogant words of those gods, lord Siva, the suppressor of arrogance, in the form of Yak$a said. Yakfeivara said:

24. O ye gods, you listen to my words with attention. I shall tell you the truth that will dispel arrogance.

25. Do not be arrogant. There is another lord who is the creator and annihilator. You have forgotten the great lord. You boast too much but you are devoid of strength.

26. If you are proud and think that you know your strength to be great, gods, split this blade of grass placed by me, with your own weapons.

27. Saying this, Siva in the form of Yak$a, the goal of the good, placed a blade of grass before them and dispelled their arrogance.



---

28. Then Visnu and other gods professing to be heroic exerted their manliness and hurled their respective weapons.

29. But the weapons of the gods were rendered fruitless before the power of Siva, the destroyer of the arrogance of the deluded.

30. Then a voice arose that dispelled the celestial surprise of the gods: “O gods, this Yaksa is Siva who removes the arrogance of the arrogant.

31. The lord himself is the creator, sustainer and annihilator. The living beings are powerful thanks only to his power. Otherwise they are not powerful.

32. Deluded by the power of his illusion you have become arrogant and have not realised lord Siva, who is the very knowledge embodied.

33. O hearing the celestial voice they became divested of their arrogance. They had realised YakseSvara. They bowed to and eulogised him.

The gods said:

34. O lord of the gods, the dispeller of arrogance, O Yakse^vara of great sports, O lord, your Maya is wonderful.

35. Even now we are deluded by this Maya of yours in the form of Yaksa. Hence, separated from you we began to speak arrogantly before you.

36. O lord, thanks to your grace alone, knowledge has dawned on us. Siva, you alone are the creator, sustainer and annihilator, none else.

37. You alone are the initiator and the withdrawer of all powers. You are lord of all, the great soul, the unchanging, the unrivalled.

38. In the form of Yak$e£vara you have removed our arrogance. With sympathy and kindness we think we have been blessed by you.

39. Then the Yaksan£tha blessed the gods, enlightened them with various instructions and vanished there itself.

Thus has been described the pleasant incarnation of Siva called Yak$e$vara that bestows pleasure, satisfaction and protection of the good.

41. The narrative is sacred; it dispels all arrogance; it bestows peace, worldly pleasure and salvation upon all good men.

42. The intelligent man who listens to or narrates this with devotion attains all desires. Then he attains salvation.

Nandikeioara said:

1. Now listen to the first ten incarnations of Siva beginning with that of Mahakala. They are resorted to with devotion and explained in Upasanakanda.

2. The first incarnation is that of Mahakala, the bestower of worldly pleasures and liberation to the good. Sakti there, is Mahakall who bestows the desired fruits on the devotees.

3. The second incarnation is called Tara. Sakti there, is Tara. Both of them confer worldly pleasures and salvation on their attendants.

4. The lord of worlds called Bala is glorified as the third incarnation. Sakti there, is Siva that bestows pleasure on the good.

6. The fifth incarnation is famous as Bhairava, who bestows desires on the devotees. Sakti there is Bhairavi who bestows desires on good worshippers.

7. The sixth incarnation of Siva is glorified as Chinnamastaka who confers desires. Sakti there, is Dhumavati who bestows all desires on the devotees.

54. The concept of god (in the male form) and his Energy (in the female form) is not peculiar to Siva-cult alone. It belongs to almost every god—Visnu, Brahma, Indra and others. It is found in pairs—Brahma-Brahmani, Siva-Siva, Visnu-Vaisnavi, Indra-Indrani. The present chapter mentions the eleven incarnations of Siva and their respective Energies.

# CHAPTER EIGHTEEN (Siva's Eleven Incarnations)

Siva said:

1. Listen to the eleven excellent incarnations of Siva on hearing which obstacles due to intimate contact with worldly objects etc. do not torment.
2. Formerly Indra and other gods defeated by the Asuras left their capital Amaravati due to fear.
3. The gods harassed by the Daityas went to Kasyapa. Highly agitated, they bowed down to him with palms joined and shoulders drooping.
4. After eulogising well, the gods made the submission respectfully. They intimated to him their misery due to that defeat. O dear, on hearing the misery of the gods their father Kasyapa whose mind was attached to Siva, was much distressed. O sage, the sage consoled and encouraged them.
5. With his mind regaining calmness he joyously went to Ka$I presided over by lord ViSvesvara.
6. Taking his ceremonial bath in the waters of the Gaiiga and performing due rites, he worshipped Lord Vi$veSvara, lord of the universe, accompanied by Parvatl.
7. With the desire for the benefit of the gods he joyously installed Sivalinga and performed an elaborate penance with Siva as the object of pursuit.
8. A long time elapsed, O sage, as he boldly performed penance with his mind attached to the lotus-like feet of Siva.
9. In order to grant the boon to that sage whose mind was devoted to his feet, Siva, kinsman of the distressed and goal of the good, appeared in front of him.
10. The delighted Siva who is favourably disposed towards his devotees said to Kasyapa, the best of his devotees, to ask for the boon.

It is the capital of Indra’s heaven, famous for its greatness and splendour. It is called Devapura, ‘city of gods’ and Pu$abh£s&#x26;, ‘sun-splendour’ and by various other names.

12. On seeing lord Siva, the delighted Kafyapa bowed to him with palms joined in reverence. Kafyapa, the progenitor of the gods, eulogised him with contentment in his mind.

Kaiyapa said

13. O lord Siva, lord of the gods, favourably disposed towards those who seek refuge in you, you are the lord of all, the great soul, achievable only through meditation, the unequalled and unchanging.

14. O lord Siva, you are the restrainer of evil forces. You are the goal of the good, kinsman of the distressed, ocean of mercy and intellectually efficient in protecting your devotees.

15. O lord, these gods are your own. They are especially devoted to you. Now they are defeated by the Asuras. Save them from distress.

16. Even Visnu cannot move in this matter. He has frequently pressed you for this job. The gods have sought refuge in me intimating their misfortune. O

17. O lord of the chiefs of the gods, destroyer of the miseries of the gods, it is for this that I have performed this penance and resorted to you. My purpose has now been fulfilled by you since you are pleased.

18. O lord, I have sought refuge in you by all means lord, please fulfill my desire. Please dispel the misery of the gods. O lord of gods, too am much distressed at the

19. of my O I make me happy. You are the source of succour to the heaven-dwellers.

20. O lord Siva, the gods and the Yak$as, born as my sons, have been defeated by the powerful Asuras. Be the bestower of bliss on the gods.

21. O lord Siva, do help the gods always lest the harassment by the Asuras should afflict them.

Nandiivara said:

22. On being thus requested, lord, Siva said “So be it” and even as he was watching he vanished there.

23. Katyapa too was delighted. Immediately he re-

turned to his abode. He eagerly intimated to the gods all the details.

1. Then, in order to keep his promise Siva was born of Surabhi assuming eleven forms.
2. There was great jubilation then. Everything became auspicious. The gods and the sage Kasyapa became delighted.
3. These are the eleven Rudras born of Surabhi:

| (1)  | Kapalin     |
| ---- | ----------- |
| (2)  | Pingala     |
| (3)  | Bhlma       |
| (4)  | Virupak?a   |
| (5)  | Vilihita    |
| (6)  | Sastr       |
| (7)  | Ajapad      |
| (8)  | Ahirbudhnya |
| (9)  | Siva        |
| (10) | Canda       |
| (11) | Bhava       |

They were born for the aid to the gods. They are identical with Siva and the cause of happiness.

Those Rudras, born of Kasyapa, rendering help to the gods, slew the Daityas in the battle. They were heroes of great strength and exploit.
By the grace of those Rudras, the gods conquered the Asuras and were rid of fear. Indra and other gods had peace of mind and ruled over their own kingdom.
Even today the great Rudras, identical with Siva, shine always in the sky for the protection of the gods.
Those Rudras favourably disposed towards their devotees took up their residence in the north-eastern city of Isana. Experts in different kinds of sports they sport about there always.
The Rudras glorified as their followers and retainers are crores in number. They are stationed everywhere in the three worlds, undividedly.
O dear, thus the eleven Rudra incarnations of Siva, pleasing to all the worlds have been described to you.
This narrative is pure, it destroys all sins. It is conducive to wealth, fame and longevity. It yields all desires.
He who listens to or reads this with pious heart enjoys all pleasures here and attains liberation hereafter.

The names of eleven Rudras differ in different Pur&#x26;gas. Born of Surabhi from Kasyapa, residing in the North eastern regions, these were directed to protect the gods against the Asuras. The Pur&#x26;gas speak of Rudras emanated from these and stationed in the three worlds for carrying out the task of protecting the good against the wicked.

# CHAPTER NINETEEN

# ( The Narrative of Durvasas)

NandUvara said:

1. O great sage, now listen lovingly to another story of Siva, how Siva was born as Durvasas for the maintenance of virtue.

2. Atri, son of Brahma, was a great sage. He was holy and a knower of Brahman. He was the husband of Anasuya. He was intelligent and he strictly followed the orders of Brahma.

3. At the direction of Brahma he went to the mountain Rk?akula⁵⁷ accompanied by his wife in order to perform penance there, with the desire to get son.

4. On the banks of the river Nirvindhya,⁶⁸ the sage who had controlled his breath and had freed himself from mutually clashing emotions performed a great penance for a hundred years.

5. He decided in his mind thus, “let that sole great lord, whoever he is, who is free from aberrations, grant me the boon of a son.”

6. A long time elapsed while he performed the holy penance. A holy flame of fire came out of him.

7. O great sage, the worlds were almost burnt by that flame. Indra and other gods and the celestial sages too were afflicted by it.

8. Then, highly distressed by that flame, sage, Indra and other gods and the sages hastened to the abode of Brahma.

9. After bowing to and eulogising Brahma the gods mentioned to him their grief. O dear, Brahma immediately went to Visnu's region along with the god.

57. o is a misprint for Rk>akula. The name Rksa (mod. Satpura) was applied to a section of the Vindhya range lying to the north of the Narmada river while the Vindhya distinguished from the (tk>sa denoted the chain lying to the south. See Sircar: GAMI Pp. 49, 56; Bhig. P. iv i. 17-18; also G.D. Day’s map of Ancient India.

58. The river Nirvindhya issues from the Rksa (Satpura) mountain and flows through VindhyaiavT.

10. O sage, after reaching there along with the gods Brahma bowed to and eulogised Vi$nu and mentioned his endless grief to him.

11. Visnu too, accompanied by Brahma and the gods hastened to Rudra’s abode. After reaching it he bowed to and eulogised lord Siva.

12. After eulogising him Vi?nu mentioned to Siva his grief caused by the flame due to the penance of Atri.

13. O sage, thus gathering there, together, Brahma, Vi?nu and Siva consulted one another about the welfare of the worlds.

14. The three deities Brahma and others, foremost among the bestowers of boons, went to the hermitage of Atri immediately to grant him the boon.

15. On seeing them marked by their respective characteristic signs, the excellent sage Atri bowed to and eulogised them respectfully by uttering pleasing words.

16. The surprised brahmin, the humble son of Brahma spoke to those deities Brahma, Visnu and Siva, with palms joined in reverence. Atri said:

17. O Brahma, O Vi$nu, O Siva, you are worthy of being worshipped by the three worlds. You are lords and masters and the cause of creation, maintenance and annihilation.

18. Accompanied by my wife, I meditated only on a single lord for obtaining a son, that lord whoever he may be, who is famous as l£vara.

19. How is it that you three deities, the foremost among the bestowers of boons have come here? Please dispel my doubt and then grant me the desired boon.

20. On hearing his words, the three deities replied “O great sage, what has occurred is in accordance with what you have conceived.

21. We three are great lords and equally leading among the granters of boons. Hence three sons originating from our parts will be born to you.

22. They will be known in the world as enhancers of

their parent’s reputation.” After saying this, the three deities returned to their abodes joyously.

23. After securing the boon, the sage joyously returned to his hermitage accompanied by Anasuya. O sage, he was delighted and he experienced the bliss of the supreme Brahman.

24. Then Brahma, Visnu and Siva, the delighted exponents of different kinds of sports, took their incarnations as the sons of his wife.

25. The part of Brahma was born as the moon in Anasuya from the great sage. Hurled by the gods into the ocean he alone could come out of it.

26. O sage, the part of Visnu was born of that lady, wife of Atri, as Datta by whom the great path of renunciation was expanded.

27. The part of Siva was born of that wife of Atri as the excellent and leading sage Durvasas who propagated excellent virtue.

28. Siva by becoming Durvasas, the enhancer of Brahminical splendour, tested the piety of many people. He was merciful.

29. The king Ambansa, a scion of the solar dynasty, was tested by him. O great sage, listen to that story.

30. The king Ambarlsa was the lord of the earth consisting of seven continents. He observed the rite of Ekada£i regularly with steady restraint.

31. The king had the firm resolve that he would perform the rite of breaking fast on the DvadaSi day.

32. Coming to know of his regular observance the excellent sage Durvasas, born of Siva’s part approached him with many disciples.

33. The king was about to take his breakfast realising that very little of Dvada£i was left on that day when the sage came there. The king invited him for food.

59. The seven Dvlpas are Jambu, Plak$a, &#x26;&#x26;lmali, Ku£a, Kraufica, Saka and Pu$kara. They are surrounded by the Oceans of salt, sugar-cane, wine, butter, curd, milk and water. See Agnif>. 108. 1-3. In this concept, the world comprises of seven Dvlpas or continents. Jambu is the central Dvlpa surrounded by an Ocean of salt water. Round this Ocean is Plak?a Dvlpa encompassed by the Ocean of sugarcane-juice and so on. Thus the seven Dvlpas are surrounded by seven seas. S.M. Ali. Geography of the PurSnas, Ch. II. on Puranic continents and Oceans.

# 34.

Then the sage Durvasas went away for his ceremonial ablution, accompanied by his disciples. In order to test the king, the sage purposely delayed there.

# 35.

Realising that there would be violation of sacred injunction otherwise, the king took in a small quantity of water and waited for the arrival of the sage.

# 36-37.

In the meantime the sage returned. Knowing that the king had already had his breakfast, the sage, born of Siva, who had assumed that form for the testing of piety, became very furious with the king. He spoke very harsh words for testing his piety.

# Durvasas said:

# 38.

O base king, after inviting but without feeding you have taken in water. I shall show you the fruit thereof. I am the chastiser of the wicked.

# 39.

After saying this he stood up, his eyes turned red due to fury and attempted to burn him. Immediately, the Sudarsana, the discus of the lord, blazed forth to protect the king and burned the sage unmindful of the fact that he was the part of Siva. It had been deluded by the Maya of Siva.

# 41.

In the meantime an unembodied celestial voice spoke to Ambarisa, the noble soul, the devotee of Brahma and Visnu.

# 42.

The celestial voice said: G king, this discus had been given to Visnu by Siva. It is now blazing against Durvasas. Quieten it.

# 43.

This sage Durvasas is Siva himself whose discus had been given to Visnu. O excellent king, do not take him for an ordinary sage.

# 44.

It was to test your piety that this great sage came. Seek refuge in him. Otherwise there will be a great destruction.

# Nandiivaui said:

# 45.

O great sage, after saying thus, the celestial voice stopped. Ambarisa too eulogised the sage who was the part of Siva himself.

1152 Swapur&#x26;pa Ambarifa said :

46. If I possess the merit of charity and sacrifice, if my spiritual duty has been well performed by me, and if our family considers brahmins godly, let the weapon of Vi$nu turn calm.

47. If our lord, favourably disposed to his devotees, is delighted with my devotion let this missile Sudar£ana become quite calm.

ff&#x26;ndttvara said :

48-49. While he eulogised in front of Durvasas, the discus Sudarsana that originally belonged to Siva became calm in all respects. Knowing him to be Siva’s part, the king Ambarisa, who had regained the composure of mind bowed to the sage whom he realised as Siva’s incarnation come there to test his vow.

50. The sage, born of Siva’s part, was much delighted. He took his meals and granted him the desired boon. Then he returned to his abode.

51. O sage, I have narrated the story of Durvasas in the course of his test of Ambarisa. O great sage, listen to another story of his.

52. O sage, through the condition stipulated by Kala in the form of a sage he conducted the test of Rama, son of Da£aratha.

53. At the very same time Lakgmana was obstinately sent in by Durvasas. O sage, Rama immediately forsook his brother in accordance with the earlier agreement.

54. The story has been diversely narrated and spread in the world by the sages. It is known by all means to the scholars. Hence it is not mentioned in detail by me.

55. Knowing his promise steady and resolute, the sage was highly delighted. The delighted sage Durvasas granted him the desired boons.

56. He had tested the resoluteness of lord Krishna too. Excellent sage, listen to that also. I shall tell you that story also.

57. At the request of Brahma, Vi?nu was born as the son of Vasudeva in order to ease the burden of the Earth as well as to protect the good.



---


# 58.

Lord Kf?na slew the wicked, the great sinners, those who harassed the brahmins and the knaves. He protected all good men and brahmins.

# 59.

Kr?na, son of Vasudeva, showed great devotion to Brahmins. Everyday he fed many brahmins with many juicy articles.

# 60.

The fame that Kr$na was especially devoted to the brahmins spread everywhere. O sage, desirous of seeing him, the sage approached Krona.

# 61.

He tied Kf?na and his consort Rukmini to the chariot and sat himself in the chariot. Krona bore the chariot delightfully.

# 62.

The sage descended the chariot. He was delighted at the steadfastness of Krona and blessed him with the boon that his body would become adamantine.

# 63.

O sage, once the excellent sage Durvasas was taking bath in the celestial river Gahga®0 when he became naked. He became a curious object of sight and was ashamed.

# 64.

Draupadi who was taking bath there provided him with the cut-piece of her garment and thus saved him from dishonour.

# 65.

As the piece of cloth reached him being carried by the current, the sage covered his private parts with it. He was therefore pleased with her.

# 66.

He granted her the boon of ever increasing folds of cloth. Later, Draupadi made the PSndavas happy due to that boon.

# 67.

That holy sage gave directive to Vi?nu and destroyed two wicked kings who had insulted him in the form of two young ones of swans.

# 68.

By his excellent brahminical splendour he established the path of renunciation in the world in accordance with the order and injunctions of the sacred lore.

# 69.

By instructions and enlightenment he uplifted many. By imparting knowledge he made many liberated.

# 60.

The Ganges flowing from the toe of Vf£Qu is called the celestial river.

70. Thus the sage Durvasas had a variegated and wonderful life, conducive to wealth, fame and longevity. To the listeners it yields all desires.

71. He who hears or reads the story of Durvasas with devotion and joy will be happy here and hereafter.

# CHAPTER TWENTYTWO

# (Harassment by Vifnu's sons and the story of Siva's incarnation of the Bull)

NandUvara said: O great sage, intelligent son of Brahma, listen to the excellent Vrse^a incarnation of Siva that performed good sports and that destroyed the arrogance of Vi$nu.

Formerly all the gods and Asuras, distressed by the fear of old age and death made alliance with each other and became desirous of taking gems from the ocean.

O son of the sage, then the gods and the Asuras attempted to churn the excellent milky ocean. 64

“With what shall the churning be carried out for the attainment of our object?” thus the gods and the Asuras were quite dismayed.

Then a celestial voice with the rumbling sound of clouds spoke to the gods and the daityas as a result of Siva’s wish and consoled them. The celestial voice said:

O gods, O Asuras, churn the milk-ocean. Undoubtedly a factual test of your strength will take place.

Make Mandara your churning rod and Vasuki your churning rope. Unitedly you carry on the churning with firm devotion.

NandUvara said: O excellent sage, on hearing the celestial voice the gods and the Asuras exerted themselves in carrying out the plan.

Allying together they went straight to the excellent mountain Mandara of golden splendour and of diverse lustre.

After propitiating Siva and after obtaining his consent they tried to uproot the Mandara in their desire to take it to the milk-ocean.

O sage, uprooting and lifting it by means of their arms they went to the milk-ocean. Their strength failing they became incapable of taking it up to the sea.



---



1. Slipping from their arms the Mandara became very heavy suddenly and fell over the gods and the Asuras.

2. Failing in their effort the gods and the Asuras broke down. After regaining consciousness they eulogised the lord of the universe.

3. At his wish in their next attempt they lifted up the mountain. They took it to the northern shore of the ocean and hurled it into the waters.

4. Then both the gods and the Asuras made Vasuki the churning rope. Desirous of taking the excellent articles they churned the milk-ocean.

5. When the milk-ocean was churned the goddess of heaven sprang up from the ocean as the daughter of Bhrgu who later became Visnu’s beloved.

6. There also emerged—Dhanvantari, the moon, the Parijata tree, the horse Uccai^ravas, the elephant Airavata, wine, the bow of Visnu, the conch, the cow Kamadhenu, the jewel Kaustubha and the nectar.

7. When it was churned again, the great poison Kalakufa blazing like the fire at the dissolution of the Yugas and terrifying the gods and the Asuras, came out.

8. From the sprays and drops that sprang up at the outcome of nectar, many damsels of wonderful beauty were born.

9. Their faces resembled the full moon in the Autumn; their lustre was as glittering and dazzling as fire, lightning or the sun and they were bedecked in divine jewels, necklaces, bracelets and bangles.

10. Sprinkling the ten quarters by the water of nectarine beauty they seemed to madden the world by their beauteous glances.

11. They emerged in crores from the nectar sprays. Then the nectar that wards off old age and death came out.

12. Visnu kept for himself Lak§ml, the conch, Kaustubha and the sword; the Sun chose the divine horse UccaiS-Ravas for himself.

13. With great eagerness the husband of SacI, the lord of the gods, took Parijata the excellent tree and Airavata the lordly elephant.

# Satarudrasariihitd

26. For the protection of the gods, Siva, favourably disposed towards his devotees, voluntarily retained the Kalaku(a in his neck and held the moon on his forehead.

27. O Vyasa, deluded by the illusion of Siva, the Daityas accepted Sura (wine) and the common people took Dhanvantari (the physician).

28. The great sages took the cow Kamadhenu. The damsels, the enchantresses became common to all.

29. A great battle for the possession of Amrta ensued between the gods and the Asuras who desired to conquer each other and who were agitated in their minds.

30. The Amrta was forcibly taken by the Daityas Bali and others, O Vyasa, of fine lustre resembling that of the fire and the sun at the dissolution of the Yugas. They defeated the gods and O overwhelmed by Siva’s illusion and harassed by the Daityas sought refuge in Siva.

31. O sage, then the Amrta was strenuously snatched away from the Daityas by Visnu at the behest of Siva, after assuming the form of a woman.

32. Visnu, the most excellent of those who wield Maya assuming the form of a woman Mohinl deluded the Asuras and made the gods drink it.

33. The leading Daityas approached her and said “Make us drink this nectar. Let there be no break in the lines.”

34. All those Daityas and Danavas deluded by Siva’s Maya said thus and gave the nectar to Visnu in disguise.

35. In the meantime on seeing the damsels born of Amrta, the leading Danavas took them to their abodes according to their convenience.

36. The cities built by the architect Maya for those women were divine, hundred times more beautiful than heaven. They were well fortified by terrible machines.

37. The daityas made those cities well guarded and set off for fighting after taking this pledge touching their chests.

*We have adopted the reading For

39. “We will never touch these women if we were to be defeated by the gods.” After saying this, the heroic Daityas became eager to fight.

40. They roared like lions. Severally they blew their conches as if filling the sky and propitiating the clouds.

41. A terrible fight ensued between the gods and the Asuras. The unrivalled battle between the gods and Asuras is famous in the three worlds.

42. Protected by Vishnu, the gods gained victory. The Daityas fled and those who remained were killed by Vishnu and his associate gods.

43. The Daityas were deluded by the gods and Vishnu the great soul. Those that survived entered the nether regions.

44. The powerful Vishnu armed with his discus chased them even after they had gone to the ultimate end of Patala65 excessively frightened.

45. In the meantime Vishnu saw those damsels born of nectar sprays who were haughty due to their divine beauty and whose faces resembled the full moon.

46. Fascinated by the Cupid’s arrows Vishnu attained highest pleasure only there. He began to indulge in sexual dalliance with those women of exquisite beauty.

47. Vishnu begot of them sons of great exploits and valour, experts in various kinds of warfare, shaking the entire earth.

48. Those sons of Vishnu of great strength and valour wrought great havoc both in heaven and earth causing misery to all.

49. On seeing the great harm done to the worlds the gods and the sages approached Brahma and informed him of this after bowing to him.

50. On hearing it Brahma took them to the mountain Kailasa. On seeing Shiva there he bowed to him again and again along with the gods.

51. Saying “O lord Shiva, be victorious, Lord of all”, he eulogised him with various hymns with palms joined in reverence and shoulders drooping down.

Brahmd said :

52. O great God, O lord of the gods, save the worlds harassed by the passionate sons of Vi?nu stationed in nether regions. O lord, Visnu now enamoured of the damsels is born of the nectar sprays. He is in nether regions indulging in passionate sexual dalliance with them.

Nandttvara said :

54. For the protection of the worlds and for the redemption of Vi$nu, Siva was eulogised thus by Brahma, the gods and the sages.

55. Then lord Siva, the ocean of mercy, realising the havoc caused by the sons of Vi?nu assumed the form of a bull.

# (The bull incarnation of Siva)

NandUvara said

1. Then bellowing in the form of a Bull, the Pinaka-bearing lord entered the crevice and shouted terribly.

2. At his bellowing sound, cities and towns crumbled down and all the citizens trembled.

3. Then the bull attacked Vi?nu’s sons wielding their bows for fighting, deluded by Siva’s Maya and proud of their great strength and exploit.

4. O excellent sage, the sons of Visnu became furious. Those heroes roared loudly and rushed against Siva.

5. Rudra in that form of a bull was furious at those sons of Vi$nu who rushed at him. He kicked them with his hoofs and tore them with his horns.

6. When their limbs were split by Rudra, they swooned and lost their lives. They were immediately destroyed.

7. When they were killed Visnu the foremost of the strong came out shouting loudly and hastened towards Siva.

8. On seeing Siva in the form of the bull going along after killing his sons, Vi$nu hit him with divine arrows and missiles.

9. Then the infuriated Siva, the highly powerful one in the form of a bull stood like a mountain and caught hold of all those missiles of Visgu.

10. O sage, shouting furiously, lord Siva in the form of a bull shook the three worlds terribly.

11. The lord leaped up suddenly and kicked the infuriated Visnu who was deluded and could not realise him. The lord then tore him with his horns.

12. Unable to bear the onslaught, Vi§nu deluded by Maya was exhausted and utterly shattered.

13. When his pride fell off, Visnu was dejected, and dispirited. He then realised that Siva was sporting about in the form of a bull.

14. Then on realising that Siva himself had come in the form of a Bull, Vi$nu spoke in a shrill voice with drooping shoulders and palms joined in reverence. Vi$nu said:

15. O lord of the gods, O ocean of mercy, O lord Siva, I had been deluded by your Maya and my mind had been confused. O lord, fought with you, Siva. Taking pity on me, lord, let this offence be excused.

16. O I

17. On hearing those piteous words of Vitfjm, lord Siva favourably disposed to his devotees spoke to Vi$nu. Siva said: O Vi$nu, O intelligent one, how you know me? Why is it that you did not fight? Your intellect has completely been depraved.

18. Why don’t you realise yourself as one whose exploit is dependent on me. You should not have indulged in sexual dalliance there. You should have refrained from all misdeeds.

20. Why should your intellect be subservient to lust? That you should indulge in dalliance with women does not behove you, O lord of gods. Remember the task of uplifting the universe.

NandiSvara said:

21. On hearing those words of Siva that imparted knowledge, Vi§nu was ashamed of himself and then he spoke to lord Siva respectfully.

Vifnu said:

22. My discus is here. I shall take the discus and return to my region abiding by your order with reverence.

NandUvara said:

23. On hearing the words of Vi?nu, lord Siva the protector of virtue in the guise of a bull, replied to Vi?nu again.

24. You shall go away quickly from this place. You shall not delay, O Visnu, this is my behest. Let your discus stay in this world itself.

25. I shall give you a discus more terrible than the sun at the time of dissolution and more efficacious than the words of Siva.

26. After saying this Siva created another blazing discus, as lustrous as the Kala fire, for the destruction of the wicked.

27. He gave the discus, as lustrous as ten thousand fierce suns, to Vi$nu, the great Atman, the protector of the gods and the leading sages.

28. After securing another Sudar£ana discus of more brilliance, Vi$nu the foremost of intelligent gods spoke to the gods.

29. “O ye gods, you listen to my statement eagerly. You must act accordingly and immediately. It will be to your advantage.

30. There are many youthful maidens in the nether regions exquisitely dressed. Any one of you can go and indulge in sexual dalliance with them.”



---

31. On hearing these words of Visnu the valorous gods became desirous of entering the nether regions along with Vi??u.

32. Knowing their intention then, lord Siva angrily cursed all the eight types of the gods. Siva said: “Excepting a quiescent sage and the Danavas born of my parts whoever enters this place shall die in a trice.”

33. After hearing these terrible words which are conducive to the increase of the benefit of human beings, the gods thus restrained by Rudra returned to their own abodes.

34. Thus Vi?nu who was excessively indulgent in women was chastised by Siva. O VySsa, he returned to heaven. The world attained normalcy.

35. Lord Siva, favourably disposed towards his devotees, returned to his mountain after carrying out the task of the gods in the guise of a bull.

36. Thus the bull incarnation of Siva that dispelled Vi^nu’s delusion and caused happiness to the three worlds, has been narrated.

37. This narrative is sacred. It dispels the harassment from enemies. It is conducive to the attainment of heaven, fame and longevity. It confers worldly pleasures and salvation to the good.

38. He who listens to this with devotion and purity enjoys all pleasures here and attains salvation hereafter. So also is the case with him who reads or teaches this to intelligent men.

66. Amara mentions ten semi-divine beings viz. 3T3TOT, TO, vnf, fTOT*. ’TfTT, ftw Sp₋ ment,° n‘ eight, without giving their names. It is not clear which two shall be excluded from the above list.

# CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR

# (PippalSda incarnation of Siva)

Jfandiivara said :

1. O intelligent one, listen with very great pleasure to the Pippalada incarnation of Siva that is excellent and that inspires devotion.

2. Formerly there was a great brahmin and an excellent sage Dadhlci. He was born of Cyavana of Bhjrgu family. He was a great devotee of Siva and very powerful.

3. In the fight with Ksuva, Vi§nu and other gods were defeated by this sage who had the support of Siva and they were cursed.

4. He had a fortunate wife Suvarca, who was very noble and chaste. The gods were cursed by her.

5. The great lord, an expert in different kinds of sports and extremely brilliant was born of her in the name of Pippalada.

S&#x26;ta said :

6. On hearing these wonderful words of NandHvara, the excellent sage Sanatkumara spoke with palms joined in reverence and shoulders drooping down.

Sanatkumdra said :

7. O NandlSvara, O intelligent one, you are blessed in that you have assumed the form of Rudra himself. O dear, you are my excellent preceptor. This wonderful story has been narrated by you.

8. O son of Silida, from my father Brahma, the account of the battle with K?uva and the defeat of Vi$QU has already been heard by me. So also the curse has been heard by me.

9. Now, I was to hear about the curse that Suvarca pronounced on the gods. Afterwards, I wish to hear the auspicious story of Pippalada.

SUta said :

10. On hearing these auspicious words of the son of

Brahma, the delighted son of Silada, remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and replied.

Nandifvara said:

# 11.

O great sage, once Indra and other gods were defeated by the Daityas who had the support of the demon Vrtra.

# 12.

All the gods had formerly kept their respective weapons in the hermitage of Dadhica. Hence they were immediately defeated.

# 13.

Then the harassed gods and the sages along with Indra went immediately to Brahma’s region and narrated their distress to him.

# 14.

On hearing the words of the gods, Brahma, the grandfather of the worlds, mentioned the details of what Tvastr was desirous of doing.

This Asura has been created by Tvastr by means of his penance in order to kill you. The name of that Asura is Vrtra. He is of great brilliance and the leader of all Daityas.

# 16.

O intelligent one, you shall make such efforts as would ensure his death. Listen to the means thereof. For the sake of virtue, I shall tell the same.

# 17.

There is a great sage Dadhici of great penance and of full control of his sense-organs. After propitiating Siva, he secured the boon of adamantine bones formerly.

# 18.

You all request for his bones. He will undoubtedly give them to you. Make the thunderbolt staff therewith and kill Vrtra without hesitation.

Nandifvara said:

On hearing the words of Brahma, Indra accompanied by his preceptor and other gods went immediately to the excellent hermitage of Dadhici.

# 20.

There Indra saw the sage in the company of Suvarca. Along with the preceptor and other gods, he humbly and respectfully bowed to him with palms joined in reverence.

# 21.

On realizing his intention, the sage, the most excellent of scholars, sent his wife Suvarca to the inner apartments of the hermitage.

# 22.

Then the king of gods, accompanied by the gods bent upon achieving his own object, and most efficient in polity spoke to the great sage.

# Indra said:

# 23.

All of us, the gods and the sages are oppressed by Tvastr. We seek refuge in you, worthy of refuge, a great devotee of Siva and a liberal donor.

# 24.

O brahmin, give us your bones of adamanatine strength. I shall make my thunderbolt with your love and kill the demon.

# 25.

Thus requested, the sage fond of helping others meditated on lord Siva and abandoned his body.

# 26.

Immediately he reached Brahma’s region with his bondage of actions quashed. There was a shower of flowers and the people were agreeably surprised.

# 27.

Indra then called the divine cow Surabhi to lick up the marrow etc. He directed Visvakarman to make the weapon with the bones.

# 28.

At his behest Visvakarman made all the weapons with the sage’s bones—very firm and adamantine—that had the brilliance of Siva.

# 29.

With his backbone he made the thunderbolt, arrow and the missile called Brahmasiras. With the other bones he made many other weapons.

# 30.

O sage, flourishing with Siva’s brilliance, the infuriated Indra lifted the thunderbolt and rushed against Vrtra like Rudra rushing against the god of death.

# 31.

Indra who was well prepared, cut off the peak-like head of Vrtra with the thunderbolt forcefully.

# 32.

There was great jubilation among the heaven-dwellers. O dear, the gods eulogised Indra. Showers of flowers fell on him.

# 33.

O dear, thus this story of Vjrtra’s slaughter is related to you as arising from the context. Now listen respectfully to the incarnation of Siva as Pippalada.

# 34.

At the behest of her lord Suvarca the chaste wife of the sage Dadhici, the noble soul went to the inner apartments of the hermitage.



---


35. At the behest of her husband she finished her household duties and came there. The pitiable lady could not see her lord there.

36. After coming there and seeing the most inauspicious occurrence there, O excellent sage, the surprised Suvarca spoke to the gods.

37. The chaste lady, on realizing that all this was the action of the gods, became angry. The infuriated wife of the excellent sage, Suvarca, cursed them.

Suvarca said:

38. “Ah! the gods are very wicked. They are covetous, stupid but very skillful in manipulating their own affairs. Let them all, inclusive of Indra, become beasts from today."

39. Suvarca, a woman saint and the beloved wife of the sage cursed the gods inclusive of Indra thus.

40. That chaste lady desired to go to the worlds of her husband. With the sacred twigs, the noble lady prepared the funeral pyre.

41. Then a pleasant celestial voice urged by Siva spoke to Suvarca, consoling her.

The Celestial Voice said:

42. O intelligent lady, do not carry out this calamitous task. Listen to my weighty words. The semen of the sage is in your womb. Develop it carefully.

43. O gentle lady, later on, you may do as you please. It is the command of Brahmi that a pregnant woman should not burn herself.

JandUoara said:

44. O great sage, after saying this the celestial voice stopped. On hearing that voice the wife of the sage was surprised for a moment.

45. That great chaste lady, Suvarca, desirous of attaining the world of her husband sat down and broke open her belly with a stone.

46. The foetus of the child of the great sage, of brill-

# Saiarudrasarhhitd

liant divine body, came out of her belly illuminating all the ten quarters.

47. O dear, it was the incarnation of Rudra himself born of the sage Dadhici. He was competent to perform his divine sports. He therefore manifested himself.

48-49. On seeing her son of divine form, the beloved wife of the sage Suvarca realised in her mind that it was the incarnation of Rudra himself. The great chaste lady became delighted, bowed to him and eulogised him. O great sage, that form of the child was impressed on her heart.

50. Suvarca of pure vision, the mother, desirous of going to her husband’s region, smilingly and lovingly spoke to her son.

Suvarca said:

51. O dear, O lord Siva, O fortunate one, stay near this holy fig tree for a long time. Be the bestower of happiness to all.

52. Out of affection allow me to go to the region of my husband. Staying there along with my husband I shall meditate on you in the form of Rudra.

Nandifvara said:

53. After speaking thus to her son that chaste lady Suvarca followed her husband by means of the great transcendental meditation.

54. O sage, thus the wife of Dadhici was re-united with her husband. After reaching Siva’s region she served Siva devotedly.

55. In the meantime the delighted gods inclusive of Indra, hurriedly came there along with the sages as though invited there.

56. Vi$nu and Brahm&#x26; too, accompanied by their attendants came over there to see Siva who had taken incarnation in the world through SuvarcS and Dadhici.

57. On seeing him there, incarnated as the sage’s son, they bowed to him with palms joined in reverence and made obeisances. O excellent sage, there was great jubilation among

the gods. The Dundubhis were sounded and dancing girls danced joyously.

59. The sons of Gandharvas sang. Kinnaras and other players played on instruments. The gods showered flowers.

60. After consecrating the refulgent child and the fig tree who became the father of Rudra, Viṣnu and other gods eulogised him again.

61. The delighted Brahma named him Pippalada. Visnu and the gods said “O lord of the gods be pleased”.

62. After saying this and making great jubilation, Brahma, Visnu and the gods went to their respective abodes.

63. Then Rudra, the great lord in the form of Pippalada, performed a penance for a long time at the foot of the fig tree, with a desire to bestow benefit on the worlds.

64. As Pippalada, following the convention of the world, performed the penance, a long time passed by.

# CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE

# (The story of Pippalada incarnation)

Nandiivara said:

1. After arranging and establishing Dharma with a desire for its good foundation, lord Siva performed great sports. O good sage, listen to that.

2. Once while going to the river Puṣpabhadra for his ablution, the great sage saw the beautiful youthful maiden Padma, a part of Siva herself.

3. Desirous of getting her, the sage traversing the world and an expert in following the established conventions went to the abode of king Anaranya, her father.

4. On seeing him, the awe-struck king of men bowed to him. Offering him Madhuparka he worshipped him devotedly.

5. The sage accepted everything with regard and requested for the hand of his daughter. Thereupon the king was unable to say anything. He was silent.

6. The sage repeated the request, saying “Give me your daughter devoutly. Otherwise I will reduce everything to ashes along with you."

7. O great sage, then all the people of the king were enveloped by the brilliance of Pippalada, son of Dadhici.

8. Then the king was much frightened and he lamented again and again. He gave his daughter Padma, fully bedecked in ornaments to the old sage.

9. After marrying Padma, the daughter of the king and a part of Siva, the sage Pippalada joyously took her to his hermitage.

10. After going to the hermitage the aged excellent sage stayed there with that woman. The sage was not too indulgent.

11. Then the daughter of Anaranya served the sage with devotion, in mind, word and deed, like LaksmI serving Vi?nu.

12. Then the excellent sage Pippalada, a part of Siva, became a young man by means of his divine sport and sported with that young lady.

13. Ten noble sons, all of them great sons, were born to the sage. They were equal to their father and increased the pleasure of Padma.

14. This is the sportive incarnation of Siva the great lord. The excellent sage Pippalada was the lord indulgent in different kinds of divine sports.

15. On seeing the harassment by the planet Saturn of everyone irremediably, the sympathetic lord lovingly granted a boon to all the world.

16. “For sixteen years from birth no man will have that affliction. Similarly to the devotees of Siva too. This word of mine is true.

17. If Saturn were to disregard my instruction and harass men, he will undoubtedly be reduced to ashes.

18. O dear, thus, afraid of him the excellent planet Saturn, though in aberration, does not afflict men at anytime.



---


19. Thus I have narrated to you the good story of the great sage Pippalāda who had assumed the form of a human being in the course of his divine sports. The story yields the fruit of all desires.

20. These three Gādhī, Kauśika the great sage Pippalāda quell the affliction of Sani on being remembered.

21-22. For the dissolution of the affliction of Saturn, the man who reads or listens devoutly to the story of Pippalāda along with that of Padmā attains all desires in this world.

23. Blessed indeed is the great sage, who was wise and a great devotee of Siva. He was a favourite of good men. Lord Siva named Pippalāda was his noble son.

24. This pious narrative is conducive to the attainment of heaven. It quells the adverse effects of the evil planets. O dear, it yields all desires and enhances devotion to Siva.

# CHAPTER TWENTYSIX

# (Siva's incarnation as Variyānātha)

Jiandīvara said:

1. O dear sage, listen to me. I shall tell you about Variyānātha, the incarnation of Siva, the supreme soul that yields great bliss.

2. Formerly, in Nandigrāma there was a prostitute known as Mahananda. She was very beautiful and a devotee of Siva.

3. She was very prosperous, rich and brilliant. She was bedecked in gems of different kinds. She was voluptuous in love.

4. She was an adept in all lores of music. She was delightful to all. Queens and kings were delighted by her songs.

69. Nandigrāma seems to be identical with Nandagaon in Mathurā-mandala.



---


# 5.

She always worshipped Siva and Pirvatl with great joy. She was interested in recounting the names of Siva. She used to wear ashes and Rudrakja.

# 6.

After worshipping Siva, the lord of the universe she used to dance with great devotion and sing the great glory of Siva.

# 7.

She kept a monkey and a cock which she decorated with Rudrakjas. She made them dance singing herself and clapping her hands.

# 8.

On seeing them dance, she, engrossed in devotion to Siva, used to laugh lovingly along with her friends and attendants.

# 9.

The monkey, as a result of her instruction, danced before her, like a boy bedecked in Rudr£k$as as ear-rings, and shoulderlets.

# 10.

The cock too was bedecked in Rudrak?a tied round its tuft. It too danced along with the monkey delighting the onlookers.

# 11.

Thus that prostitute indulging in these delightful pranks and pursuing devotional service to Siva was very happy always. O excellent sage, a long time thus elapsed when

# 12.

she was quite happy performing her devotional service to Siva.

# 13.

Once Siva assumed the form of a merchant and visited her house to test her. He had assumed the auspicious form of a devotee.

# 14.

His forehead was marked with Tripui?dn». He wore Rudr£k$a as ornaments. He was interested in recounting the names of Siva. He was clad as a devotee of Siva. He wore matted locks of hair.

# 15.

He had smeared ashes all over his body. Round his wrist was tied an excellent bangle set with gems.

# 16.

The beautiful prostitute worshipped and welcomed the visitor with great joy. She made him sit with great respect.

# 17.

On seeing the excellent bangle round his wrist she coveted the same. In great surprise she said.

Mahdnandd said:

18. This bangle set with great gems around your arm captivates my mind. It is worthy of being an ornament of a celestial damsel.

NandUvara said:

19. On seeing that she wished for the bangle set with nine gems, the liberal-minded merchant spoke smilingly.

Vaiiyandtha said:

20. If your mind wishes for this excellent gemset ornament you can have it with pleasure. But what is the price you are willing to pay?

The prostitute said:

21. We are prostitutes flirting here and there and not chaste ladies. Undoubtedly the regular practice observed in our family is harlotry.

22. If I take the bangle from you I shall be your wife for three full days and nights.

The merchant said:

23. O beloved harlot, if your words are true, let it be as you say. I shall give you the gemset bangle. Be my wife for three days and nights.

24. In this deal the witnesses are the moon and the sun. Repeat three times “True” and touch my heart, O beloved.

The prostitute said:

35. O lord, I shall be your wife for three days and carry out all wifely duties. This is true. This is undoubtedly true.

NandUvara said:

26. After repeating this for three times, with the moon and the sun as witnesses, Mah&#x26;nand&#x26; touched his heart with pleasure.

27. After giving her the gemset bangle that merchant handed to her a gemset phallic image and spoke thus.

# Satarudrasarhhitd

1177

The merchant said:

28. O my beloved, this gemset phallic image is very dear to me. It shall be well-preserved strenuously and in secret by you.

NandUvara said:

29. She said “Let it be so” and took the gemset phallic image. She kept it in the middle of the dancing platform and entered the house.

30. During the night she had her sexual union with the merchant who behaved like a libertine. She then went to sleep on the couch brilliant with a soft bed.

31. O sage, then at midnight, at the will of the lordly merchant, suddenly there arose a fire70 in the middle of the dancing platform.

32. The blazing fire helped by a forceful wind enveloped the dancing platform all of a sudden.

33. When the platform was burning the prostitute got up suddenly in her bewilderment and let the monkey free untying it.

34. Freed from the bondage the monkey in its fear ran here and there along with the cock and scattered sparks of fire.

35. On seeing the phallic image burnt along with the pillar and smashed utterly, the prostitute and the merchant felt endless distress.

36. On seeing the phallic image as it were his very soul burnt, the lordly merchant desired to end his life in order to know her mentality.

37. In great despair and sorrow the merchant told her in grief. Lord Siva who had assumed a human body just for pleasure indulged in different sports.

38. “O my beloved, when the phallic image is smashed and burnt I do not desire to live. I am telling you the truth. There is no doubt in this.

39. O gentle lady, prepare a pyre for me immediately through your servants. With my mind fixed in Siva, I shall enter the fire.

70. Read for in the printed Skt. text.



---


40. Even if Brahma, Indra, Viṣṇu and others were to prevent me, O gentle lady, I shall enter the fire this moment and shall forsake my life.

NanAUvara said:

41. On realising his tenacious decision the harlot was much distressed. Outside her house she caused the pyre to be made through her servants.

42. Then the merchant who was only Siva himself went round the blazing fire. Desirous of knowing her intentions he entered the fire firmly.

43. O excellent sage, on seeing him enter the pyre, the harlot was dismayed. The youthful maiden sympathised with him.

44. The miserable harlot remembered the sacred vow and said piteously glancing at all her kinsmen.

Mahānandā said:

45. Taking the gemset bangle I had taken the pledge that I shall be the avowed wife of this merchant for three days.

46. This merchant, the avowed Saivite, died of my activities. Hence I shall enter fire along with him.

47. Truthful preceptors have ordained that a wife shall observe her duty. If I do likewise my truthfulness will not be marred.

48. Abiding by truth is a great virtue. Great goal can be attained through truth. Heaven and liberation can be achieved through truth. Everything is founded on truth.

SandUvara said:

49. Although prevented by her kinsmen the harlot was obstinate in her resolve. The woman eager in the attainment of Satyaloka decided on giving up her life.

50. She gifted away her property to leading brahmins. She meditated on Sādīva. She circumambulated the fire thrice and stood ready to enter it.

51. As she was going to jump in the fire with her



---


mind fixed in his feet, Siva, the soul of the universe, appeared in front and stopped her.

52. On seeing the three-eyed lord of the gods, decorated by the moon’s digit, and as brilliant as crores of moons, suns and fires she stood as if stunned and frightened.

53. The lord caught hold of the hands of the frightened and agitated lady, stunned, trembling and shedding tears. He consoled her and spoke. Siva said:

54. It is to test your truthfulness, piety, courage and steady devotion to me that I came near you assuming the form of a merchant.

55. With my magic I produced the blazing fire and burnt your dancing platform. After burning the gemset phallic image I entered fire myself.

56. But you remembered the promise and entered the fire along with me. Hence I shall give you such pleasures as are inaccessible to gods.

57. O beautiful lady of good hips, whatever you wish I shall give you. I am delighted by your devotion. There is nothing which cannot be given to you.

Nandiivara said:

58. When Siva, lord of Parvati, favourably disposed to his devotees said thus, the harlot Mahananda replied to Siva. The prostitute said:

59. I have no desire for enjoyment on the earth, in the heaven or in the nether worlds. I do not desire anything except the touch of your lotus-like feet.

60. My servants, my maids and my kinsmen are interested in seeing you. They have dedicated everything to you.

61. Take them all along with me to your great region and quash the terrible fear of rebirth. Obeisance be to you.

Nandiivara said:

62. Appreciating her words, the great Siva took all of them to his great region.

1180 Sivapurd$a

63. Thus I have described to you the great incarnation of Vaisyanatha. It was pleasing to Mahananda. It yields great bliss to devotees.

64. This narrative is great holy and divine. It grants desires to good men immediately. This story of the incarnation of Siva as the lordly merchant is the source of great happiness. It is wonderful.

65. He who listens to this story with devotion and narrates it with purity never swerves from his duties. He attains salvation hereafter.

# CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN

# {The incarnation of Dvijeivara}

Nandiivara said:

1. O dear, listen, I shall expound to you the incarnation of Siva the great soul as Dvijeivara (a leading Brahmin) along with Siva. It is pleasing to the good.

2-3. O dear, I have already described to you the excellent king Bhadrayu whom Siva blessed in the form of a bull. In order to test his steadfastness and piety the lord manifested himself again in the form of a leading brahmin. I shall mention that same story.

4. Conquering the enemies through the power of abha in battle, Bhadrayu attained the throne, O dear.

5. O brahmin, the chaste lady Kirtimalini, daughter of Candrangada and Simantini, became his wife.

6. O sage, once after the advent of spring, the king Bhadrayu entered a thick forest along with his beloved queen, for sport.

7. In that beautiful forest, the king sported about along with his beloved who protected those who sought refuge in her.

71. This Chapter has a close resemblance with the second canto of KAIidasa’s Raghuvaihsa.



---


8. Then, in order to test his steadfastness and piety, lord Siva carried out his sports there itself along with Siva.

9. Siva and Siva in their own divine sports assumed the form of a brahmin couple and created an illusory tiger with their Maya.

10. Not far from the place where the king stood, they began running in great fright on being pursued by the tiger. They cried and shouted too.

11. O dear, the king Bhadriyu, the leading Kshatriya worthy of being sought refuge in, saw both of them highly distressed and lamenting.

12. O leading sage, the illusory brahmin couple, extremely terrified, spoke to the king Bhadriyu. The brahmin couple said:

13. O great king, O foremost of the knowers of virtue, save us both. O great lord, this tiger is rushing on in order to devour us.

14. This beast of prey is like the god of death. It is terrifying to all living beings. Knower of virtue that you are, save us before it pounces on us and devours us.

Nandtfvara said:

15-16. After hearing the lamentation of the pair, the great king of great heroism immediately took up his bow, but the rushing tiger of Maya origin seized the brahmin's wife.

17. The terrible tiger grasped the woman even as she was lamenting “O lord, O husband, O Siva, O, preceptor of the universe.”

18. The king struck the tiger with sharp arrows; but it was not at all affected by them. It stood like a lofty mountain, which is not affected by showers.

19. The powerful tiger, not at all pained by the missiles of the king, seized the woman forcibly and ran away in a hurry.

20. On seeing his wife seized by the tiger, the brahmin was much bewildered and following the way of the world cried again and again.

21. After crying for some time that brahmin who was...

# 1182

lord Himself wielding his May5, spoke to the king Bhadrayu dispelling his arrogance.

Dvijsivara said:

1. O king, where are your great weapons? Where is your great bow that professes to protect? Where is your strength of ten or twelve thousand great elephants?
2. Of what avail is your sword? Your conch? Of what avail is your learning in the lores of mantras and missiles? Of what avail is your might? Of what avail is the strength of your great missiles?
3. All these have become futile, for you are incompetent to meet the onslaught of wild animals.
4. The greatest duty of a K?atriya is the protection from injury. When that virtue hereditarily practised in your family is lost, of what avail is your life? T*
5. Kings protect the distressed people who seek refuge in them with their very lives and assets. They are the knowers of virtue. Without that they are like a dead body.
6. Better death than life that does not protect the distressed. A mendicant is better than a rich householder who does not possess charitable nature.
7. Better to swallow poison or enter fire than cease to protect the oppressed, the helpless and the poor.

JfandUvara said:

On hearing his lamentation and the decrial of his prowess, the king thought within himself thus
“Alas, my manliness is lost today due to the adverse fate. Today my fame has been quashed. Great sin has been acquired.
The hereditary virtue has been smothered. I am unfortunate and confused in mind. Certainly my riches, my kingdom, my longevity will dwindle.
By surrendering my own life, lovable though it is, I shall make this brahmin free from grief, this brahmin whose wife has been seized by the tiger and who is pained extremely."

S3. Having decided thus in his mind that excellent king Bhadriyu fell at his feet and spoke to him in conciliatory tone.

Bhadriyu said:

1. O Brahmin, I am a base Kshatriya bereft of strength. You take pity on me. O intelligent one, do not grieve. I shall give you what you desire.
2. This kingdom, this queen, this body of mine, everything is subservient to you. What is the greatest thing that you desire?

The Brahmin said:

What can a blind man do with a mirror? Of what avail is a house to him who lives on alms? What can a fool do with a book? Of what avail is wealth to him who is bereft of his wife?
Hence I who am not satiated with the enjoyment of pleasures but I whose wife is snatched away desire your crowned queen. Let her be given to me.

Bhadriyu said:

I can give all my assets to the extent of the earth, my kingdom, horses and elephants and even my body to anyone but never can I give away my wife.
The sin that accrues by indulging in sexual intercourse with another man's wife cannot be wiped off even by hundreds of expiatory rites.

The Brahmin said:

Let it be the terrible sin of the slaughter of a Brahmin; let it be the sin of sipping wine, I shall quell it with my power of penance. What then the sin of enjoying another man's wife?
Hence give me your wife. I have no other desire. Certainly you will go to hell by your inability to protect the oppressed.

ffandlivara said:

At the words of the Brahmin, the frightened king



---


thought to himself, “It is a sin to withhold protection. It is proper under the circumstance to give away my wife."

43. Hence I shall give my wife to this deserving brahmin and escape sin. Immediately thereafter I shall enter fire. My fame then shall be known.

44. After deciding mentally like this, he kindled a blazing fire. He called the brahmin and gifted away his wife with water.

45. He took the ceremonial bath and became pure. He bowed to gods, went round the fire thrice and meditated on Siva with pure mind.

46. He was just to fall into the fire with his mind fixed at the feet of Siva, the lord of the universe when DvijeSvara revealed himself and stayed him.

47-49. The king saw in front of him the five-faced, the three-eyed lord with the Pinaka in his hand, bedecked by the digit of the moon, with hanging matted hair shedding tawny lustre, having the brilliance of a crore of midday blazing suns, white as the lotus stalk fibre, wearing the hide of the elephant, with his head drenched by the waves of Ganga, having the necklaces of great serpents, bedecked in coronet, waistband, shoulderlet and shining bangles, holding in his hands, the trident, the sword, the missile Khafvanga, the dagger, the shield, the deer, the mystic sign of protection, the eight articles of worship and the Pinaka, seated on his bull and blue-necked.

50. Then from the sky divine showers of flowers fell. The divine instruments were played. The celestial damsels sang and danced.

51. Visnu, Brahma, Indra and other gods excluding Narada and other sages too came there eulogising.

52. While the king was watching with palms joined in humility and devotion, there was great jubilation that enhanced devotional feelings.

53. The vision of the lord increased his pleasure. The incessant tear-drops smeared his body. He had horripilation and choked throat. With palms joined in reverence, he eulogised the lord.

54. The supreme lord, the storehouse of mercy and

AttandHoarfihiU 1185 his consort Parvati were very much delighted. The lord then spoke to him thus:

# 55.

“O king, I am satisfied with your devotion more than your piety. Mention the boon that you as well as your wife wish to choose. I shall undoubtedly give it to you.

# 56.

It was to test your feelings and emotions that I assumed the form of a brahmin and approached you. She who was seized by the tiger is the goddess Siva herself.

# 57.

It was an illusory tiger which could not be hit by your arrows. I wanted to test your courage by demanding your wife.

# 58.

On hearing the words of the lord, the king Bhadrayu eulogised and bowed to the lord with bent head. Bhadrayu said:

# 59.

O lord, this alone is a great boon that you became visible to me searched by the sun of worldly existence.

# 60.

O lord, since out of pity you wish to accord me a boon, I choose it as a great devotee does from his lord, the granter of boons.

# 61-62.

O great god, my father Vajrabahu with his wife, O lord, I a servant at your feet, along with my wife, the VaiSya Padmakara and his son Sanaya, O great lord, make all of us residents near you.

# 63.

Nandiivara said: Then the queen, his wife, Kirtimalini propitiated Siva with devotion and requested for an excellent boon. The queen said:

# 64.

O supreme God, Candrangada my father and SimantinI my mother, I request the two to be joyously staying near you for ever.

# 65.

Nandiivara said: The delighted lord of Gauri, favourably disposed to his devotees said, “Let it be so” and granted them the boon they desired and then vanished in a moment.

66. Acquiring the grace of the trident-bearing lord, Bhadriyu, enjoyed several pleasures lovingly in the company of Kirtimalini.

67. Unimpeded in the exercise of his power he ruled the kingdom for ten thousand years. Then he entrusted his son with the kingdom and went to Siva’s presence.

68. The king Candrangada and the queen Simantinl devoutly worshipped Siva and attained his feet. Thus the great incarnation of lord Siva as Dvijeivara has been described by me. It was the bestower of great bliss on Bhadriyu.

69. He who reads or listens to this holy narrative of Dvijeia incarnation of Siva of pious fame, goes to Siva's region.

70. He who listens to this every day or narrates this with attentive mind does not swerve from his duty and attains salvation hereafter.

# CHAPTER TWENTYEIGHT

# (Siva’s incarnation as Yatin&#x26;tha hathsa)

Nandltvara said:

1. O intelligent sage, listen. I shall explain the incarnation of great bliss named Yatinitha, of Siva the supreme soul.

2. O great sage, on the mountain Arbuda there lived a hunter Ahuka of Bhilla tribe.

3. His wife Ahuka observed some good rites. Both of them were great devotees of Siva and worshipped Siva.

4. O sage, once this Bhilla who was always devoted to Siva went far into the forest for fetching food for his wife.

5. In the meantime towards the evening, Siva wmimwi the guise of an ascetic and came to his house to test him.

74. It can be identified with the present Abu, a sacred bill of the Western India, lying in the Sirohi state of Rajaputana.

# 1187

# 6.

The lord of the house that intelligent man too came back then and lovingly worshipped the leading ascetic.

# 7.

In order to test his feelings, Siva in the guise of an ascetic, indulging in great sports lovingly said to him in a piteous tone.

# 8.

TatinStha said:

O Bhilla, give me some place here to stay today. I shall by all means leave in the next morning, you will be blessed for ever.

# 9.

Bhilla said:

O lord, what you say is true. But please listen to me. The room is not spacious enough to hold us all together.

# 10.

Nemdifvara said:

Thus addressed, the ascetic wanted to leave. By that time, considering the trend of thought of her husband the Bhilli said.

# 11.

O lord, give him room to stay. Do not turn out a guest. Consider the duty of a householder or virtue will be affected.

# 12.

You stay in the house along with the ascetic. I shall remain outside with immense weapons.

# 13.

Nandiivara said:

On hearing the virtuous and auspicious words of his wife, the Bhilla thought thus.

# 14.

"How can I stay in the house after keeping my wife out. It will be sinful on my part if the ascetic goes elsewhere.

# 15.

Neither of the two courses is proper for a householder. What is destined to happen will surely happen. I shall stay outside.”

# 16.

After thinking thus and insisting on it, he kept both of them within the house joyously, himself stayed outside the house keeping all the weapons beside him.

# 17.

During the night the cruel beasts of prey tormented him. He too strenuously withstood them to the extent of his ability.



---


18. Thus fighting strenuously and although very strong, the Bhilla was devoured by the beasts of prey which seized him forcibly, as though incited by his own adverse fate.

19. Getting up in the morning the ascetic saw the Bhilla of the forest devoured by the beasts of prey. He felt much dejected at it.

20. Although the Bhilli too was distressed, she suppressed her sorrow on seeing the ascetic miserable and spoke thus. Bhilli said:

21. O ascetic, why are you sorry? What has happened is for good. Blessed and contented is he since the death has happened in this manner.

22. O ascetic, reducing myself to ashes, I too shall follow him. Be pleased to arrange for the pyre. This is the eternal duty of women.

23. On hearing her words which he thought to be proper, the ascetic arranged the pyre. She entered the pyre dutifully.

24. In the meantime Siva himself appeared before her and spoke praising her lovingly “O blessed lady, O blessed lady.” Siva said: O lady, mention the boon you wish to have. I am pleased with your conduct. There is nothing which cannot be granted to you. I am utterly subservient to you.

25. On hearing the words of Siva yielding the greatest bliss she felt the highest pleasure. She did not remember anything.

26. On seeing her in that state, Siva was much delighted. He asked her again to mention the boon she wished to have.

27. Swa said: This ascetic who is in my own form will assume



---

the form of a swan in the next birth. He will lovingly unite both of you.

29. This Bhilla will be born as Nala, the son of Virasena, in the excellent city of Niṣadha. There is no doubt in this.

30. You will be born in the illustrious city of Vidarbha as the daughter of king Bhima. You will be famous as Damayanti endowed with all good qualities.

31. After coming together you will enjoy royal pleasures. You will attain salvation too, inaccessible even to leading Yogins.

NandUvara said:

32. After saying this, Siva assumed the form of phallic image. He became stationary. He is thereafter remembered as Acaleśa.

33. O dear, the Bhilla Ahuka was born as the son of Virasena in the city of Nisadha. He was the great king Nala.

34. That great Bhilla, Ahuka was born as the daughter of king Bhima in the city of Vidarbha. She became famous as Damayanti.

35. Siva in the form of Yatinatha was born as a swan. He managed the marriage of Damayanti with Nala.

36. It was due to the merit accruing from hospitality that lord Siva gave them pleasure after assuming the form of a swan.

37. The incarnation of Siva as the swan adept in the art of intelligence, was the bestower of great bliss to Damayanti as well as to Nala.

38. This great and holy narrative of Siva’s incarnation of illustrious fame as swan is wonderful and indeed the bestower of salvation.

39. He who narrates or listens to the auspicious story of incarnation of Yatinatha hamsa, attains the greatest goal.

75. The city of Niṣadha or Naiṣadha associated with King Nala can be identified with Nalapura, modern Narwar situated on the river Kalisindhu to the south-west of Gwalior.

76. The capital of Vidarbha is placed in Mahārāṣṭra. It is the same as Kuṇḍa in Pur, modern Beder to the east of Amarāvati in Berar.

40. The story is faultless, bes tower of the fruits of all desires and very excellent. It is conducive to the attainment of heaven, fame and longevity. It enhances devotion.

41. After hearing this narrative of Siva in the forms of an ascetic and a swan, the hearer enjoys all pleasures here and goes to Siva’s abode hereafter.

# CHAPTER TWENTYNINE

# (The incarnation of Siva as Krpnadarfana)

Nandiivara said:

1. O Sanatkumara, listen to the description of the great incarnation of Siva, the excellent Krsnadar£ana who gave perfect wisdom to Nabhaga.
2. Iksvaku and others were the sons of Sraddhadeva77 of whom Nabhaga was the ninth. His son was Nabhaga.
3. Ambarisa was his son who was a devotee of Vijnu with whom the sage Durvasas was much pleased due to his devotion for Brahmins.
4. O sage, the grandfather of Aidbarisa was Nabhaga to whom Siva imparted perfect knowledge. Listen to his story.
5. Nabhaga the son of Manu, highly intelligent, and with perfect control of his sense-organs stayed in the abode of his preceptors for studies for a long time.
6. During this interval Iksvaku and other sons had their due shares in the property without leaving any share for Nabhaga.
7. At the behest of their father, the shrewd sons took their shares and enjoyed the kingdom without any misery. They were fortunate.

77. According to this Purina, Sriddhadeva had several sons, Ik?v&#x26;ku and others, of whom Nabhaga was the ninth. Nabhaga had a son named Nabhaga. The latter had a son named Ambarlja. Pargiter omits Srfiddhadeva and Nabhaga and mentions NabhSga instead of Nibhaga as the father of Ambarisa.

8. After learning the Vedas with their sections and sub-sections, in due course, the Brahmacarin Nabhga returned.

9. O sage, on seeing his brothers Ik§vaku and others having taken their shares, Nabhaga desirous of his share told them affectionately. Nabhaga said:

10. O my brothers you have taken your shares duly without leaving anything for me. I have now come for my share. Please give me mine.

11. Then We had forgotten to allow your share. We shall certainly do it now. Our father is your share. Take him.

12. On bearing the words of his brothers Nabhaga was surprised. He approached his father and said. Nabhaga said:

13. O father, my brothers have taken their shares leaving me out. I had been to the preceptor’s abode for study as a student.

14. When I returned I asked them to allot my share; they replied that you are my share. I have now come for that purpose.

NandUvara said:

15. O sage, on hearing his words, his father Sraddha-deva was surprised. He consoled his son who was devoted to truth and virtue.

Mam said:

16. O dear, do not pay heed to what they said. It was only to deceive you. I am not a share by any means, an instrument of enjoyment.

17. Still since I have been given as a share by the deceitful persons I shall tell you the means of livelihood. Hear attentively.

18. The intelligent Angirasa brahmins are performing a sacrifice. Every sixth day the rites are marred.

19. O wise Nabhaga, you go there and praise them.



---


Recite two VaUvadeva sukatas there. That sacrifice will then become perfect.

20. As soon as the sacrifice is concluded those Brahmins going heavenwards will give you delightedly the wealth left over in the sacrifice.

NandUvara said:

21. On hearing the words of his father, Nabhaga who considered truth as virtue went eagerly where the excellent sacrifice was on.

22. O sage, in that sacrifice during the diurnal rites the intelligent son of Manu recited two Vaisvadeva suktas clearly.

23. When the sacrifice was concluded the Angirasa brahmins gave him the wealth left after the sacrifice.

24. Realising that he was taking the wealth left after the sacrifice, Siva of divine sports manifested himself all of a sudden.

25. He was beautiful in every limb, a glorious Purusa Krsnadargana. It was to survey his emotional reaction and to bestow on him the perfect knowledge as his share that the lord manifested himself.

26. Lord Siva desirous of testing Nabhaga the son of Manu approached from north and said.

Siva said: O man, who are you that take away my wealth? Who has sent you here? Tell me the whole truth.

Nandihara said:

28. On hearing his words, dear, the poet Nabhaga, son of Manu humbly replied to the Purusa Krsnadar£ana.

Nabhaga said:

29. This wealth of the sacrifice has been given to me by the sages. Why do you, O Kr^adarsana prevent me from taking it.

NandUmra said:

30. On hearing these truthful words uttered by Nabhaga, the delighted purusa KrsnadarSana spoke.

JCffnadarJana said:—

31. O dear, in our dispute the ultimate authority is your father. Go to him and ask him. What he says will be true and final.

Ndndiivata said:

32. On hearing his words, the wise Nabhaga son of Manu, approached his father anxiously, O sage, and asked him about what he said.

33. On hearing what his son said, Manu Sraddhadeva remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and after recollecting spoke to him.

Manu said:—

34. O dear, listen to my words: that Puru§a is lord Siva. Every object is his and particularly what is obtained from the sacrifice.

35. That what is left over after the sacrifice is Siva’s share. This argument is current among some intelligent people due to his will.

36. Undoubtedly lord Siva deserves everything. What then of the wealth left over in a sacrifice? More depends on the lord’s wish.

37. O Nabhaga, the lord has come in that form in order to bless you. Go there. Propitiate him properly.

38. Request him to forgive your fault. Bow to him well and eulogise him. That Siva alone is the lord of all, the lord of sacrifice, the lord of everything.

39. Vi$nu, Brahma and other gods, Siddhas and the sages, O dear, are competent in their respective duties only due to his blessings.

40. O foremost of my sons, go there quickly. Do not delay. Propitiate the great god, the lord of all by every means.

JVandiivara said:

41-42. After saying this, Manu Sraddhadeva, sent his son immediately to Siva. After approaching him and bowing to him with palms joined in reverence and head bent down, the delighted Nabhaga of great intellect spoke to him humbly.

Nabhaga said:

1. O lord, my father says that whatever there is in the three worlds is yours to be sure. What then about the wealth left over in a sacrifice?
2. O lord, what I said before was done in error and ignorance. Please forgive the same. I propitiate you with my head bent down.
3. After saying this, Nabhaga of dejected mind, eulogised lord Siva Kr$nadarsana with palms joined in reverence and with his head bent down.
4. The pure-souled Sraddhadeva too with head bent and palms joined eulogised the lord and requested him to forgive his fault.
5. In the meantime, Visnu, Brahma, Indra and the gods, Siddhas and the sages came there.
6. They were jubilant. They joined their palms in reverence. With great devotion they severally bowed down and eulogised.
7. Then the delighted Rudra, Kr$nadarsana glanced at them with sympathetic eyes and smilingly spoke to Nabhaga.

Kr$nadarsana said:

What your father said is virtuous and true. You too spoke the truth. Hence you are good. There is no doubt in this.
Hence I am delighted with your holy rites. Sympathetically I am conferring on you the eternal Brahman, the perfect knowledge. O Nabhaga, along with the brahmins immediately.
Be great and wise, take all this wealth granted out of compassion.
O intelligent one, enjoy all pleasures without any aberration. By my grace you will attain the good goal along with the brahmin sacrifices.

Nanditoara said:

O dear, after saying this, lord Siva, favourably disposed to truth, vanished there itself even as all were watching.

55. Vi?nu, Brahma, the gods and all others, O excellent sage, went to their respective abodes after joyously bowing to that direction.

56. Sraddhadeva too, accompanied by his son, went joyously to his abode. After enjoying extensive pleasures he went to Siva’s city in the end.

57. Thus, O Brahmin, the incarnation of Siva, named Kr$nadar$ana, bestower of bliss on Nabhaga, has been narrated to you.

58. This narrative is holy and conducive to worldly enjoyment. It grants salvation to the good. It yields the fruits of desires to those who read and listen to it.

# (The incarnation of Siva as AvadhUteSvara)

NandiSvara said:

1. O son of Brahma, listen to the first incarnation of the great lord, named AvadhuteSvara, who dispelled the arrogance of Indra.

2. O sage, formerly Indra accompanied by Bfhaspati and the other gods went to Kailasa in order to see Siva.

3-4. On knowing that Brhaspati and Indra were coming and in order to test their mind in their eagerness to see him, the lord indulging in different kinds of sports assumed the form of an Avadhuta. He was naked. He looked fierce and had the lustre of blazing fire.

5. The Avadhuta, the goal of the good, blocked their way. He stood there with matted hair hanging loosely and the whole feature shining brilliantly.

6. Passing that way towards Siva, Bfhaspati and Indra saw the gigantic figure of wonderful features on the way.

1196 Sivapturfaa

7. Without Knowing that the Puru?a was Siva himself, the sage, Indra who was arrogant due to his authority asked him as he stood in his way.

Indra said:

8. Who are you? Whence have you come in this form of a naked Avadhuta? What is your true name? Tell me quickly and factually.

9. Is Siva in his abode? Or has he gone out? I am now going to see him along with my preceptor and the gods.

NandiSvara said:

10. When asked by Indra that Puru?a who was lord Siva himself who had taken that body sportively in order to quell his arrogance did not say anything.

11. Indra asked him again; but Siva whose ways are unknown, who was in the naked form and who was the creator of fanciful things did not say anything.

12. Again Indra, the lord of heaven and the master of the three worlds, asked him. The great Yogin of great sports remained silent.

13. Though asked by Indra again and again thus, lord Siva remained silent desirous of quelling the arrogance of Indra.

14. Then the lord of the gods proud of his suzerainty over the three worlds became furious and said rebuking the lord having matted hair.

Indra said: O: you even though I am asking, you are

15. fool, not giving me any answer. Hence I am going so kill you with my thunderbolt. O wicked fellow, who is there to protect you?

16. After saying this and staring at him in fury Indra raised his thunderbolt in order to kill the naked person.

17. On seeing Indra lifting up the thunderbolt, Siva made his hand stunned.

18. Then that Puru?a, furious and terrific, with terrible eyes, blazed with his brilliance as though he would burn everything.

# Satarudrasamhitd

19. The lord of Saci burnt within himself due to the anger resulting from the benumbed state of his hand like a serpent whose fury had been curbed by a magical formula.

20. On seeing the Purusa blazing thus in his own brilliance Brhaspati knew him to be Siva and bowed to him soon.

21. Brhaspati of liberal mind kept his palms joined together and prostrated on the ground like a staff and eulogised him with devotion. Brhaspati said:

22. O great god, lord of the gods, favourably disposed towards those who seek refuge in you, O lord of Gauri, be pleased. O lord of all, obeisance be to you.

23. Even Brahma, Visnu and others are all deluded by your Maya. They do not know you really. If at all they know, it is only by your blessings.

Nandtfvara said:

24. After eulogising lord Siva, Brhaspati made Indra fall at his feet.

25. O dear, then the liberal-minded preceptor of the gods, Brhaspati, the intelligent one, bowed humbly and spoke thus. Brhaspati said:

26. O great god, lord of the distressed, please raise me up, who have fallen at your feet. Do not be furious. Be kind and loving.

27. O great god, be satisfied. Save Indra who has sought refuge in you. Fire originating from your eye in the forehead is coming out.

JVandh'vara said:

28. On hearing the words of Brhaspati, the lord in the form of Avadhfita, the ocean of mercy, indulging in good sports, laughingly said.

Avadhuta said:

29. How can I withhold the life that has come out of...

my eye due to anger? How can a serpent take up a slough that has been cast off.

NandUmra said:

# 30.

On hearing these words of Siva, Brhaspati with his mind agitated due to fright spoke again with palms joined in reverence.

Brhaspati said:

# 31.

O lord, devotees are always to be pitied. O Siva, thus make your name Bhaktavatsala true.

# 32.

O lord of the gods, it behoves you to cast off this fire elsewhere. Please lift up Indra since you are the uplifter of all devotees.

NandUmra said:

# 33.

Thus requested by Brhaspati, Siva who bore the name of Bhaktavatsala, the delighted soul and the dispeller of the distress of those who bow down, replied.

Siva said: O preceptor of the gods, I pleased with you.

# 34.

I shall grant you excellent boon. You will be famous as ‘Jlva* because you have gifted life to Indra.

# 35.

I shall cast off this fire which has come out of the eye in my forehead, and which is unbearable to the gods, so that it will not afflict Indra.

NandUvara said:

# 36.

After saying this he took the wonderful fire, originating from his eye in the forehead in his hand and cast it off into the briny sea.

# 37.

Then that fire originating from the eye in the forehead of Siva and cast off into the briny sea became a boy immediately.

# 38.

He became the lord of Asuras known as Jaiandhara and Sindhuputra (Son of the Sea). At the request of the gods, lord Siva slew him.

41. After seeing the lord for which they had come there, Brhaspati and Indra returned to their respective abodes joyous and contented.

42. Thus the incarnation Avadhutesvara of lord Siva has been narrated by me. It yields the highest bliss and punishes the wicked.

43. This narrative is faultless and conducive to heaven and fame. It yields worldly pleasures and salvation. It is divine and it gives the fruits of all desires.

# CHAPTER THIRTYONE

# (The incarnation of Siva as Bhikyuvatya)

Nandiivara said:

1. O excellent sage, I shall now narrate the incarnation of Siva in which he dispelled the suspicion of a brahmin woman.

2. There was a king in the land of Vidarbha, named Satyaratha. He was virtuous, regularly observing truthfulness and a favourite of great devotees of Siva.

3. O sage, as the king ruled over the kingdom virtuously observing piety to Siva, a long time elapsed very happily.

4. Once a great fight ensued between that king and the Salvas who laid siege to his city with many armies puffed up with their strength.

5. The king of Vidarbha had a terrible fight with them. But his armies were destroyed and he was killed by Salvas due to adverse fate.

# 6. SivapuT&#x26;Qa

When the king was killed in the battle by the Salvas, the terrified soldiers who survived death fled along with the ministers.

# 7.

His crowned queen who was pregnant and who had been imprisoned by the enemies escaped from the city, O sage, during the night.

# 8.

Coming out of the city the grief-stricken crowned queen slowly went very far in the eastern direction with her heart set on the lotus-like feet of Siva.

# 9.

Early in the morning next day after she had traversed a long way, the queen saw a pure lake, thanks to the mercy of Siva.

# 10.

After reaching the banks of the lake the distressed beloved of the king, of tender body, resorted to a shady tree for rest and stay.

# 11.

Fortunately in an auspicious and meritorious hour the queen gave birth to a son endowed with all divine characteristics.

# 12.

The thirsty mother, the wife of the king, entered the lake for drinking water but as willed by fate she was devoured by a crocodile in the water.

# 13.

The son bereft of father and mother, distressed by hunger and thirst at the time of birth, cried out.

# 14.

O sage, when the new born babe was weeping and wailing in the forest, lord Siva, the immanent soul and protector, was moved to pity.

# 15.

A wandering beggar woman came there accidentally, urged mentally by Siva, the dispeller of fear.

# 16.

She was a widow and was herself carrying her one year old son. She saw an orphaned child weeping there.

# 17.

O sage, on seeing an infant boy in the desolate forest that brahmin woman was surprised and pondered over the situation in diverse ways.

# 18.

“An extremely wonderful thing has been seen by me now. It cannot be conceived by the mind or explained in words.

# 19.

This infant whose umbilical cord has not been cut lies on the bare ground. He has no mother. He is weeping but he is very brilliant.

# 20.

He has no parents or persons to help him. What might have caused this? Alas, how strong is the power of fate!

# 21.

I do not know his parentage. There is none who knows him. Whom can I enquire about the details of his birth? But I feel drawn towards him.

# 22.

Without knowing his birth and parentage I shall not touch him 79 although I wish to nourish him and bring him up as a child born of me.

# NandUvara said:

# 23.

While the excellent brahmin lady was musing thus, Siva, favourably disposed to his devotees, took pity.

# 24.

Lord Siva of great sports, bestower of happiness on devotees in every respect, unconditionally for ever, by himself assumed the form of a mendicant.

# 25.

The mendicant who was lord Siva himself suddenly came to the place where the doubting brahmin lady, desirous of knowing the details, was standing.

# 26.

The lord whose ways are inscrutable, who is the storehouse of mercy and who assumed the form of the leading mendicant, laughed and told the brahmin lady.

# The mendicant said:

# 27.

O brahmin lady, do not entertain any doubt in your mind. Do not be sorry. Protect this pure boy, your adopted son, lovingly.

# 28.

Ere long you will attain a great glory through this infant. Nourish this extremely brilliant infant by all means.

# NandUvara said:

# 29.

That brahmin lady respectfully and lovingly asked Siva, the storehouse of mercy, in the form of a mendicant who spoke thus.

# The brahmin lady said:

# 30.

At your behest I shall nourish and bring up this boy as though he is my own son. There shall be no doubt in this. You have come here by my good fortune.

# Stvapurs^a

31. Still I wish to know the particular details and facts about him. Whose son is he? Who are you, that have come here?

32. O lord, O excellent mendicant, again and again the thought occurs to me that you are Siva, the ocean of mercy and this infant had been your devotee formerly.

33. Through some defect in his past actions he has attained this plight. After experiencing it he will surely attain glory, thanks to your bliss.

34. It is by your Maya that I have been deluded. I had lost my way. In order to protect him I have been urged by you to come over here.

Nandiivara said:

35. Siva in the guise of a mendicant spoke to the brahmin lady who had attained perfect knowledge by seeing him and who evinced the desire to know the details.

The mendicant said:

36. O brahmin lady, listen with pleasure to the antecedents of this boy. O sinless one, I shall mention all the details to you.

37. This boy is the son of Satyaratha, king of Vidarbha a great devotee of Siva and devoted to his duty.

38. Listen, the king Satyaratha was killed by his enemies in the battle. His excited and distressed wife set out from the palace at night.

39. She came here in the morning and gave birth to this boy. Due to thirst she got into the lake and as fate would have it, was seized by the crocodile.

NandUvara said:

40. Thus he narrated to her all the details, the manner of his birth, the death of his father in the battle and that of his mother due to the crocodile.

41. O great sage, then the brahmin lady who was surprised asked the mendicant of perfect knowledge in the form of a Siddha, again.

The brahmin lady said:

1. O mendicant, how was his father, the king, killed in the midst of his enjoyment of excellent pleasures, by his enemies the Salvas in a few days?
2. How was the mother of this infant devoured by the crocodile so suddenly? How did he happen to be orphaned and helpless ever since his birth?
3. How is it that my son too is very poor and a beggar? O mendicant, how will these two sons attain happiness? Please tell me.

NandUvara said:

On hearing these words of the brahmin wife, the delighted mendicant, lord Siva himself, said laughingly.

The mendicant said:

O brahmin lady, I shall answer all questions in detail. Listen with attention to this excellent narrative.
The father of this boy, the king of Vidarbha, was the excellent king Pandya80 in his previous birth.
That king was a devotee of Siva. He ruled over the entire earth virtuously. Quelling all disturbances he made all the subjects happy and contented.
Observing fast and other rites in the day and night on a TrayodaSi (thirteenth) day, once he worshipped Siva, the lord of all, at dusk.
As he was worshipping Siva at dusk in the course of his holy rites there arose a great noise, in the city, hideous in every respect.
On hearing that noise, the king left the worship of Siva unfinished and went out of his palace suspecting the arrival of enemies.
In the meantime his powerful minister came near the king catching hold of the enemy king.81
On seeing the enemy king, he was extremely

Agitated by anger, disregardful of the right course, he caused him to be beheaded.

54. Without concluding the worship of Siva, the defiled king, confused in mind and bereft of auspiciousness, took his food at night with pleasure.

55. He was born as the king of Vidarbha. He observed holy rites of Siva during this birth also, since there was a hindrance to his worship of Siva (during the previous birth) he was now killed in the midst of his enjoyment.

56. His son in the previous birth was born as his son in this birth too but he was bereft of riches due to the break in the worship of Siva.

57. The mother of this boy had killed her co-wife in the previous birth. Hence due to that sin, she was devoured by the crocodile in this birth.

58. Thus their activities have been narrated to you. People having no devotion to Siva and not worshipping him attain poverty.

59. This son of yours was an excellent brahmin in his previous birth. He spent his life in accepting gifts but he did not perform holy rites, like sacrifice etc.

60. O brahmin lady, hence your son has incurred poverty. Seek refuge in Siva in order to ward off that sin.

61. Let the worship of Siva be performed by these two sons. Only after the investiture with the sacred thread will Siva bestow glory.

jYandisvara said:

62. After instructing her thus, Siva in the form of a mendicant, favourably disposed towards his devotees, revealed his real self to her.

63. On coming to know that he was lord Siva, the brahmin lady bowed to and eulogised him with choking words full of devotion.

64. Even as the brahmin lady stood watching, Siva had taken the form of a mendicant and vanished there itself.

65. When the mendicant disappeared, the care-free brahmin woman took that boy and her son home.

66. She took up residence in the beautiful city Eka-cakra82 and nourished the prince and her own son with excellent food.

67. Their sacred rites and the investiture with the sacred thread were performed by the brahmins. They grew up thus devoted to the worship of Siva in their own house.

68. O dear, at the behest of the sage Sandilya they observed vows and restraints and performed the worship of Siva during dusk.

69. Once when the prince went to the river for his bath without the brahmin boy, he found an excellent pot of treasure.

70. Thus four months elapsed as the two boys continued their worship of Siva.

71. As they continued the worship of Siva again with great joy, a year elapsed in the very same house.

72-73. O sage, after a year had elapsed, the prince once went to a forest along with the brahmin boy. There a Gandharva came by chance and gave his daughter in marriage to the prince. The prince ruled over the kingdom without any check or hindrance.

74. He considered the brahman lady who brought him up as his mother and the brahmin boy as his brother.

75. In name of Dharmagupta he continued to propitiate the lord of gods and enjoyed pleasures along with the princess in the kingdom of Vidarbha.

76. Thus the incarnation of Siva as the Bhik$uvarya bestowing happiness on the prince Dharmagupta has been narrated by me now.

77. This narrative is pious, extremely sanctifying and holy. It is an instrument for attaining virtue, wealth, love and liberation. It yields all pleasures.

78. He who listens to this tale or narrates this to others with pure mind enjoys all pleasures here and goes to the region of Siva hereafter.

82. It was the town of Kicakas according to the Mhh.

# CHAPTER THIRTYTWO

# (The incarnation of Siva named Sureivara)

NandUvara said:

1. O dear, listen, I shall narrate the incarnation of Siva, the great soul, as Indra in which he was beneficial to Dhaumya’s elder brother.
2. The intelligent son of Vyaghrapada, Upamanyu, the beloved of the good, became the son of a sage in another birth. He achieved great attainments then.
3. Upamanyu, the son of Vyaghrapada, while yet a small child stayed in his uncle’s house along with his mother. Due to adverse fate he was very poor.
4. Once he tasted a little milk in his uncle’s hermitage. Approaching his mother he implored for milk, yearning for it.
5. On hearing the words of her son the pitiable mother went in and thought of a proper means to satisfy the child.
6. She ground some seeds and grains she got by gleaning, into a paste with water. She gave this artificial milk to her son after fondling and coaxing him.
7. After drinking the artificial milk given by his mother the boy said, "O, this is not milk" and cried again.
8. On hearing the cry of her son, she wiped off his lotus-like eyes and said in grief.

The mother said:

How can we the dwellers of the forest for ever have milk? Without the grace of Siva we can never have milk.
O son, only that can be attained what we had dedicated to Siva in our previous birth. We need not worry in this matter.
On hearing the words of his mother, the son of Vyaghrapada excessively fond of his mother, freed of his grief, replied to her.
“O blessed mother, do not grieve. Cast off this sorrow. If Siva is the benefactor, everything will result in welfare. O mother, listen to me. If there is lord Siva anywhere, sooner or later I shall achieve the ocean of milk.”

# Jhtarudrasarhhiti

NandiSvara said:

14. After saying thus with pleasure and repeating “Let there be a welfare”, he bowed to his mother and left her. He began to perform penance.

15-16. It was on the mountain Himavat that he went to perform his penance with pure mind taking nothing in except air. He installed Siva’s phallic image of clay after making a pedestal for it with eight bricks. He invoked Siva along with Parvati into the phallic image with devotion. He repeated the five-syllabled mantra. The boy worshipped Siva with leaves, flowers and other things.

17. He meditated on Siva along with Parvati repeating the five-syllabled mantra. Worshipping thus he performed great penance for a long time.

18. O sage, due to the penance of the boy Upamanyu, the great soul, the whole world consisting of the mobile and immobile beings blazed as it were.

19. In the meantime, requested by Visnu and others, Siva assumed the form of Indra in order to test his devotion.

20. Parvati took the form of Saci. The Ganas became the gods, Nandin became the elephant Airavata. Everything belonging to Siva became that of Indra.

21. Then Siva accompanied by Parvati and the Ganas, and assuming the form of Indra went to the hermitage of Upamanyu in order to bless him.

22. O great sage, in order to test his devotion, Siva in the form of Indra, spoke to the boy in a grave tone. Indra said:

23. “O boy of good rites, I am pleased with you and your penance. Mention the boon you wish to have. I shall give you whatever you desire. There is no doubt about this.”

24. Thus addressed by Siva in the form of Indra, the boy replied with palms joined in reverence, “I choose devotion into Siva.”

83. The five-syllabled mantra of Siva is “Namafe Siv&#x26;ya”,

84. The dialogue between Indra and Upamanyu is reminiscent of the talk between Parvati and the student ascetic. Cp. Kkilidftsa’s Kumflra. Canto V.

25. On hearing it Indra said — “You do not know me the lord of the gods, the lord of the three worlds, Indra, bowed to by all the gods.

26. O brahmin sage, be my devotee. Worship me alone on every occasion. I shall grant you every benefit. Leave off Rudra devoid of attributes.

27. Enough of Rudra devoid of attributes. What purpose of your can be achieved by his worship? He is out of the caste of the gods. He has become a Pisaca.

Nandiivara said:

28. On hearing these words, the son of the sage considered them an obstacle to his austerities. Repeating the five-syllabled mantra he told him who had come to create obstacles.

Upamanyu said:

29. All this has been mentioned by you indulging in insult of Siva. Incidentally you have mentioned that Siva, the lord of the gods, is attributeless as well as Pisaca.

30. You do not know Siva, lord of the chiefs of gods, the father and progenitor of Brahma, Visnu and MaheSa and greater than Prakrti.

31. I choose the boon from that deity, whom the philosophers call eternal, the single, the multitude, separate from the existent and non-existent and the unmanifest.

32. I choose the boon from that deity whom the knowers of reality consider free from causations, disputes and the bestower of the principles of Sarikhya and Yoga.

33. There is no greater entity than lord Siva who is beyond the attributes. He is the cause of all causes. He is the most excellent of Brahma, Vi§nu and other gods.

34. I do not wish to take a boon from you or Brahma or Visnu. Nor do I want any boon from any other god. Let Siva be the bestower of boons on me.

35. Of what avail is speaking much? I tell you the truth and my decision. I do not request any other god except Siva. O enemy of mountains, my

this matter. I infer that I have committed sins in the pre-vious birth since I am forced to hear the insult to Siva, on hearing which one shall shed his own mortal body at the very same moment. He goes to Siva’s region thereby.

38. O base god, let it be that I had yearned for milk. I shall kill you by Siva’s missile and then leave off my mortal frame.

Nandtfvara said:

39. After saying thus, Upamanyu who was prepared to die, cast off his desire for milk and got ready to kill Indra.

40. He took some ashes from the receptacle and invoked it with the mantra Aghorastra. The sage, thereafter discharged it against Indra and roared.

41. Remembering the feet of Siva, his favourite deity, he got ready to burn himself. He stood there bearing the fiery pose.

42. When the brahmin was engaged thus, the lord in the form of Indra warded off the fiery pose of the Yogin by gentle means.

43. At the behest of Siva, Nandin the favourite of Siva delightedly caught hold of the Aghorastra discharged by him, in the middle.

44. Assuming his own form with the moon for his crest, lord Siva revealed it to the brahmin.

45. The lord then showed him a thousand milk oceans, the ocean of curds and the ocean of different food-stuffs.

46. Thus Siva was seen seated on his bull accompanied by the goddess. He was surrounded by the leading Ganas and the divine weapons, the trident and others.

47. The drums were sounded in the heaven. There was a shower of flowers. All the ten quarters were covered by Brahma, Visnu and other gods.

48. Then Upamanyu was swept by the waves of the ocean of delight and he prostrated on the ground like a staff, with his mind humble with devotion.

49. In the meantime the smiling lord Siva called him.

1210 Swapurdya saying “Come on, Come on” and kissed him on the head. He granted him boons.

Siva said:

# 50.

“Dear Upamanyu, I am pleased with your excellent behaviour. O brahmin sage, you are very firm in your devotion. I just desired to know you thoroughly.

# 51.

Enjoy the pleasure of eating sumptuously forever along with your kinsmen. Be ever happy and free from misery. Be devoted to me.

# 52.

O fortunate Upamanyu, you have been made eternally my son today. Parvati, here, is your mother.

# 53-54.

O great sage, thousands of oceans of milk, curd, ghee and honey, and of different foodstuffs I grant you lovingly. Accept them. I confer on you the state of a god and the eternal chieftainship of Ganas.

# 55.

I, Siva, am your father and she, Parvati, is your mother. Choose your boons whatever you desire.

# 56.

Be unaging and undying and free from misery. You will be famous, brilliant and endowed with divine knowledge. You will be a great lord.

# 57-58.

Then considering his great penance, the delighted Siva gave ten boons to the sage Upamanyu. He bestowed on him the knowledge of Siva and his rites. He instructed him in the vows of Siva. He gave him fluency of speech and efficiency. He bestowed his own region on him.

# 59.

After granting him the boons, lord Siva took him with both the hands, sniffed at his head and showed him to the goddess saying: “This is your son.”

# 60.

Listening with pleasure and placing her hands on his head she granted him the everlasting status of a son.

# 61-62.

She gave him undecaying, compressed ocean of milk, the prosperity and power of yoga, the undying knowledge of Brahman and the great assets.

# 63.

After receiving from Siva and Siva the excellent boons, and the eternal status of their son, he rejoiced much.

# 64.

Then the delighted sage requested the lord of the gods after bowing to him with palms joined in reverence.

# Satarudrasarhhitd

Upamanyu said:

65. O lord of gods, be pleased. O supreme lord, be pleased. Grant me the greatest devotion unto you, divine and unswerving.

66. O great god, give me great faith in persons devoted to you, the state of being your servant, your great affection and your constant presence.

Nandtivara said:

67. After saying this, the delighted excellent brahmin Upamanyu eulogised great lord with words choked in delight.

68. Thus requested, Siva, the lord of all, replied to Upamanyu, delightedly while everyone listened.

Siva said: O dear Upamanyu, O one, you are blessed. You

69. are especially my sinless devotee. Whatever has been chosen by you has been given to you.

70. Be unaging and undying and free from misery. Be respectable to all, free from aberrations and the foremost among devotees.

71. O excellent brahmin, you will have undwindling kinsmen, family and race. Your devotion to me will be permanent.

72. O sage, I shall be ever present in your hermitage. Stay at ease. Do not be anxious.

Nandiivara said:

73. After saying this and granting him all excellent boons, the lord vanished from there, accompanied by Parvati and the Ganas.

74. After receiving excellent boons, the delighted Upamanyu went to the abode of his mother and described everything to her.

75. On hearing it, his mother was highly delighted. He became worthy of honour and respect of all. He attained great happiness.

76. O dear, thus, the incarnation of Siva the great

77. This story is pious and it yields the fruits of all desires. It is conducive to heaven, fame and longevity. It yields worldly pleasures and salvation to the good.

78. He who listens to this with devotion and narrates this with purity of mind enjoys all pleasures here and attains Siva’s goal hereafter.

# CHAPTER THIRTYTHREE

# (Siva’s incarnation as the student-ascetic)

NandUvata said: —

1. O Sanatkumara, listen to the incarnation of Siva the great soul. It is named Jatila and is very sanctifying.

2. After abandoning her body when she was insulted by her own father in the sacrificial hall, Sati, the daughter of Daksa, was born of Mena and the mountain Himavat.

3. Desiring to attain Siva as her husband, she went to the dense forest and performed a pure penance. She was attended upon by two of her friends.

4. In order to test her penance, Siva an expert in various kinds of sports sent the seven sages to the penance grove of Parvatl.

5. The sages went there and thoroughly tested her. As she was strenuous in her effort they could not dissuade her from her penance.

6. They returned and bowed to Siva. After mentioning all the details to him and obtaining his permission they returned to heaven eagerly.

7. When they had gone to their abodes, lord Siva, the cause of excellent sports, desired to test Siva’s activity himself.

R5. The seven sages are: Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasi$(ha. See P. 163 note.

3. Then the lord assumed the pleasant, self-controlled and wonderful form of a student-ascetic.

9. He looked very old and had assumed the body of a brahmin. He was shining with brilliance. He had a staff and an umbrella. He was mentally delighted.

10. Assuming this form of a Jatila (one with matted hair), the delighted Siva, favourably disposed to his devotees went to the penance-grove of Parvati.

11. There he saw the goddess Parvati, seated on the dais surrounded by her friends. She appeared like the pure digit of the moon.

12. On seeing the goddess, Siva who is favourably disposed to his devotees and who had assumed the form of a student-ascetic approached her eagerly and lovingly.

13-14. On seeing the brahmin visitor of wonderful splendour, quiet with hairy limbs, bearing the staff and hide of deer, the aged bachelor with matted hair and the water-pot, she welcomed and worshipped him with all the articles of worship.

15. The goddess Parvati enquired after the health of that aged bachelor respectfully after worshipping him with great joy.

16. “O most excellent one among the knowers of the Vedas, who are you, please, in the guise of a student-ascetic and whence have you come illuminating this forest?

NandUvara said:

17. On being asked thus by Parvati, that brahmin replied immediately with great pleasure in order to test the feelings of Siva.

The student-ascetic said:

18. I am a brahmin bachelor going about here and there as I please. I am a saint pleasing and helping others undoubtedly.

NandUvara said:

19. After saying this, the bachelor Siva, who is favourably disposed to his devotees, stood near her concealing his real form.

# Sivapurdna

The student-ascetic said:

20. What shall I say, O great lady? There is nothing to be mentioned. A great calamity seems to have happened, extremely confusing.

21. In your fresh youth, the means of good enjoyment and the cause of happiness through all requisite articles of pleasure, you are performing this penance in vain.

22. Who are you? Whose daughter are you? Why are you performing a penance in this desolate forest? Your penance is such as cannot be outdone even by sages of elevated souls.

Nandtfvara said:

23. On hearing his words, Parvatl laughed and spoke to the excellent student ascetic with reverence.

Parvati said:

24. O sage, O brahmin bachelor, listen to the details of my wife. I am born in Bharata in the house of Himavat.

25. Formerly my birth was in the house of Daksa. I was then Sati, the wife of Siva. On account of my father’s insulting my husband I cast off my body by means of Yoga.

26. O brahmin, in this birth too, Siva came my way due to merit but he reduced Kama to ashes, abandoned me and went away.

27. When Siva went away I was overwhelmed with grief. A bit ashamed, I came away from my house to this place for performing penance after being initiated by the statement of my preceptor.

28. Mentally, verbally and through activities too, Siva has been chosen by me as my husband. I am telling you the truth and not falsehood.

29. How can I achieve it? Still, thanks to the great zeal, this penance is being pursued by me now.

86. For the close similarity of ideas and verbal expressions in verses 20 to 61, see Kalidasa’s KumSra V., also RudrasamhitS, F&#x26;rvatl-khan^a, Chs 26, 27.

30. Leaving off Indra and other gods, Viṣnu and Brahma I wish to obtain Siva as my husband really.

Nandiivara said:

31. O sage, on hearing these firm words of Parvatī that Jafila Rudra laughingly spoke again.

Jafila said:

32. O gentle lady, O daughter of Himavat, what is this idea that has struck you? You are performing this great penance for obtaining Siva after leaving off all the gods.

33. I know that Siva. Listen. I shall tell you that bull-bannered Siva wears matted hair and is ill-mannered.

34. He is an isolationist for ever. Particularly he is a detached fellow. Hence it does not behove you to get mentally entangled with him.

35. O gentle lady, your features etc. and those of Siva are ill-matched. I do not like this. But do as you please.

NandUvara said:

36. After saying this, Siva in the guise of a student-ascetic rebuked himself in her presence in order to test her.

37. On hearing his intolerable words, Parvatī replied extremely infuriated at him who was engrossed in insulting Siva.

38. Till now I thought that you would be some one fit to be killed. But now it is quite clear that you are not to be killed.

39. You are some foolish knave in the guise of a student-ascetic. O fool, Siva has been insulted by you. Hence, I am infuriated.

40. You do not know Siva. You are averse to Siva. Since I had already welcomed and honoured you I am now distressed.

41. The accumulated merits of the person who insults Siva without knowing reality are reduced to ashes.

42. One should perform expiation after touching a Siva-hater.

43. O wicked fellow, you said I know Siva. Certainly he is not known to you. Siva alone is the great lord.

44. Assuming many guises through his Maya, Rudra may appear in any form. But the beloved of the good, having no aberrations, lavishly bestows all desired things on me.

Nandtfvara said:

45. After saying this, Parvatl expatiated on Siva’s principle, where Siva was explained as attributeless and unchanging performing the penance of Brahman.

46-47. On hearing her words, the brahmin began to say something; but by that time, Parvatl whose mind was attached to Siva and who was averse to Siva being insulted, immediately spoke to her friend Vijaya.

Pdrvati said:

48. Friend, this base brahmin must be prevented. He is going to speak again. He is sure to insult Siva.

49. It is not only the censurer of Siva who becomes sinful but also he who listens to such insults.

50. A rebuker of Siva shall be slain by all means by Siva’s attendants. If he happens to be a brahmin he shall be abandoned. He shall go away from that place immediately.

51. This wicked fellow will insult Siva again. Being a brahmin he cannot be killed. He shall be abandoned. He should not even be looked at.

52. Let us leave this place and go elsewhere. Do not delay, lest there should be any further talk with this ignorant man.

Nandttvara said:

53. O sage, after saying this Parvatl was just to walk away when Siva revealed himself and caught hold of her cloth.

54. After assuming that divine form which Parvatl was meditating upon, Siva spoke to her as she stood face downwards.

Siva said:

55. “O Parvati, where are you going, leaving me? You cannot be forsaken by me. You have been tested by me O faultless one, you are really steady in your devotion to me.

56. Desirous of knowing your feelings I have approached you in the guise of a student-ascetic and spoke these diverse words.

57. O Parvati, I am delighted at your steady devotion. Mention the boon that you have cherished in your mind. There is nothing that cannot be given to you.

58. O loving lady, I have been made your slave from now onwards by means of your penance. Due to your beauty, even a moment seems to expand into a Yoga.

59. Leave off your bashfulness. You are my eternal wife. O beloved, come on, I shall go to my hilly abode along with you.”

60. When the lord of gods said thus, Parvati rejoiced much. Whatever misery she experienced in performing the penance, she cast off immediately.

61. On seeing that divine form of Siva, Parvati replied to the lord with face lowered due to bashfulness. Parvati said: O lord of gods, you are delighted, you have pity on me, be my lord and husband.

62-63. Thus requested by Parvati Siva took her hand duly and went to Kailasa along with her. On getting him as her lord, she carried out the task of the gods.

64. O dear, thus the incarnation of Siva in the form of a student-ascetic wherein he tested the feelings of Parvati has been narrated to you.

64. This narrative explained by me is faultless and magnificent. He who listens to this with pleasure becomes happy and attains salvation.

2. O sage, when goddess Parvati, daughter of Himavat, performed the pious penance in order to attain Siva, after going to the forest, Siva was much delighted at her austerity. He approached to test her conduct and out of pleasure to grant her the desired boon.
3. O sage, the delighted Siva revealed his real form to her and told Parvati, “Mention the boon you wish to have.”
4. On hearing the words of Siva and on seeing his excellent form, Parvati was delighted. She spoke to him after paying her homage.

Parvati said:

O lord of gods, if you are delighted, if a boon shall be granted to me, O Siva, you be my lord and husband. Please take pity on me.
With your permission I shall go to my father’s abode. O lord, you shall approach my father.
In the form of a mendicant and making your spotless fame known, beg me of my father and make the householder’s life fruitful.
O lord Siva, it behoves to marry me with due rites for the fulfilment of the task of the gods.
O lord, you are without aberrations. Please fulfil my desires. You are favourably disposed to the devotees. I am always your devotee.

NandUvara said:

Thus requested by her, Siva who is favourably disposed towards his devotees said “So be it” and vanished from there. He returned to his mountainous abode.
After making her beauty fruitful, Parvati returned.

13. On hearing Parvati's return, Himavat accompanied by his attendants and his wife Mena joyously came to see his daughter.

14. On seeing her delighted, both of them received her suitably within the house and glad at heart celebrated the event with pleasure.

Mena and the lord of mountains made gifts to brahmins and others. The auspicious mantras of the Vedas were chanted.

16. Then Mena joyously stayed for a while in the yard with her daughter and Himavat went to the Ganges for a bath.

17. In the meantime Siva, favourably disposed towards his devotees and indulging in good sports, assumed the form of a dancer and approached Menaka.

18. He held the horn in his left hand and the small drum in his right. He carried a bundle of patched garments on his back. He wore a red cloth. He appeared to be an expert in dance and music.

19. Then the lord in the form of a dancer performed various dances joyously in the yard of Menaka and sang sweetly.

20. He blew on the horn and played on Damaru producing sweet notes. With great pleasure he exhibited a variety of splendid sports.

21. The citizens including men, women, children and old women gathered there suddenly to see him.

22. sage, hearing the sweet song and witnessing the splendid dance, the people were fascinated and Mena too was highly delighted.

23. Immediately Mena whose mind was in exultation, thanks to his clever feats, went to give him potfuls of gems and jewels.

26. In the meantime the lord of the mountains returned from the Ganges. He saw the mendicant in the form of a man standing before him in the yard.

27. On hearing from Mena all the details he too was infuriated. He ordered his attendants to drive out the mendicant. O no one could drive out.

28. He was an excellent sage, blazing and brilliant like a big fire and could not be touched.

29. O dear, then that mendicant, an expert in different sports, exhibited his infinite power to the mountain.

30. Immediately the mountain saw him assuming the form of Visnu, then the form of Brahma and in a trice that of the sun. O dear, then he saw him

31. in the excessively wonderful form of Siva accompanied by Parvatl. He was exquisitely handsome and brilliant. He was laughing.

32. Thus he saw him in various forms. He was much surprised and extremely delighted.

38. Then the leading mendicant of good sports begged for Durga as his alms, of her (Mena) and of him (the mountain). He did not accept anything else.

34. Then lord Siva in the form of the mendicant, urged by Durga’s words vanished and went away to his abode suddenly.

35. Perfect knowledge then dawned on Mena and the lord of mountains. They thought: “The lord Siva has deceived us and returned to his abode.

36. Our Parvati who has performed a hard penance shall be given to him”, thinking thus they became extremely devoted to Siva.

# [The incarnation of Siva as a saintly brahmin]

Nandiivara said:

1. O omniscient Sanatkumara, listen to the incarnation of Siva, the supreme soul, as Brahmin in the garb of a saint.
2. On realising the excellent devotion of Mena and Himavat towards Siva, the gods became worried and they consulted one another eagerly.
3. If the mountain were to give his daughter to Siva with undiluted devotion, certainly he will attain salvation immediately.
4. He is the receptacle of infinite gems. If he attains liberation, the name of the earth, Ratnagarbhil (having gems within) will certainly be meaningless.
5. He will cast off the stationary state of a mountain and assume a divine form. After giving his daughter in marriage to the trident-bearing lord he will go to Siva’s region.
6. With the blessings of Siva he will attain identity in form with the great god. He will enjoy all great pleasures there and then attain liberation.
7. O sage, after discussing like this, the gods went to the abode of their preceptor. In order to achieve their self-interest they submitted to the preceptor thus.
8. The gods said: O preceptor, please go to the abode of Himavat for the accomplishment of our task. Reproach lord Siva and try to prevent the mountain’s excessive devotion to him.
9. O preceptor, if the mountain gives his daughter to Siva with great faith he will attain salvation. Let him stay on the Earth itself.

On hearing the words of the gods, he thought over that and spoke to them. The preceptor said:

# 11.

O gods, one of you shall go to the mountain for achieving the end. I am incapable of doing it.

# 12.

Or you all, including Indra, go to Brahma’s region. Tell him all your details. He will carry out your work.

# NandUvara said:

# 13.

On hearing these words and reflecting thereon, the gods went to Brahma’s assembly. They submitted all the details to Brahma.

# 14.

On hearing words and deeply reflecting, Brahma told them, ‘I shall not censure him, for that will yield misery to us and dispel our happiness for ever.

# 15.

O gods, you go to Kailasa and propitiate Siva. Request that lord to go to the abode of Himavat.

# 16.

Let him approach the lord of mountains and censure himself. Censuring others is conducive to destruction and censuring oneself is conducive to glory.

# NandUvara said:

# 17.

Then the gods hastened to Kailasa and bowed to Siva with great devotion. They mentioned everything in detail to him.

# 18.

On hearing the words of the gods, lord Siva accepted their proposal. He laughingly consoled the gods and made them return without worry.

# 19.

Then lord Siva, who is favourably disposed towards his devotees, who is the wielder of Maya and who is free from aberrations, desired to approach Himavat.

# 20-21.

He assumed the form of a brahmin Saint. He held a staff and an umbrella. He wore divine garments. A brilliant caste mark shone on his forehead. He had tied a *salagrama* stone round his neck and held a string of crystal beads in his hand. He frequently repeated the names of

Visnu with devotion. He approached Himavat who was accompanied by his kinsmen.

22. On seeing him, Himavat and his attendants stood up and then prostrated before him. They performed A§tariga salvation on the ground.

23. Then the lord of mountains asked him “Who are you please?” The brahmin Yogin replied immediately with reverence. The Saintly brahmin said:

24. O mountain, I am a devotee of Visnu known as Sadhudvija. I possess true vision. I am omniscient and I assist others. By the power of the preceptor I can go everywhere.

25. O excellent mountain, by my divine knowledge, I have known something while I was in my abode. Listen. I shall mention the same with pleasure to you without any arrogance.

26. You wish to give your daughter who is as comely as Laksmi to Siva whose family and conduct are unknown.

27. O lord of mountains, this idea of yours is not conducive to auspiciousness. O most excellent one among the wise, born of Visnu’s race, you should know this.

28. O lord of mountains, see for yourself. He has no single relative. You can verify your relatives and your beloved.

29. Ask Mena and others excluding Parvatl. O mountain, the patient never likes the medicine but relishes undesirable diet.

30. In the matter of gifting away Parvatl, he is not the deserving person. As soon as this alliance is announced, the public will smile derisively.

31-32. He is without support. He is unattached. He is ugly, devoid of attributes and unchanging. He is hideous. He resides in the cremation ground. He is naked and handles serpents. He smears ashes as decoration. Serpents twine round his head. He has fallen from all stages of life. His ways are ever unknown.

Brahma said:

33. After saying these factual statements insulting to Siva, Siva of diverse sports, quickly returned to his abode.

34. On hearing the words of the brahmin, they thought thus— “What can we do with regard to him who is engrossed in adverse things?”

35. Then Siva performed great sports delighting the devotees. He married Parvati and carried out the task of the gods. O dear, thus the incarnation of lord Siva Sadhu-

36. as vesadvija, that carried out the task of the gods has been narrated to you.

37. He who reads or listens to this pious narrative, conducive to heaven and longevity, becomes happy and attains salvation.

# CHAPTER THIRTYSIX

# (Siva’s incarnation as Aivatthdman)

Nandisvara said:

1. O omniscient Sanatkumara, listen to the incarnation of lord Siva, the great soul Asvatthaman.

2. O sage, though a part of the celestial sage of great intellect Brhaspati, the self-possessed and prudent Drona was born of Bharadvaja but not of any womb.

3. He was the foremost among the archers, heroes, a brahminical sage, well-versed in all lore, of great fame and brilliance and the most excellent of all the wielders of weapons and missiles.

4. Learned men knew Drona as the most excellent, skilful in the lore of archery as well as the Vedas, of variegated activities, and as one who made his race flourish.

5. O brahmin, thanks to his strength, he was the instructor of the Kauravas. He was the most well known among the six Maharathas among the Kauravas.

# 1225

6. The most excellent brahmin Drona performed an elaborate penance with Siva in view for obtaining a son in order to help the Kauravas.

7. O excellent sage, then the delighted lord Siva, favourably disposed to his devotees, appeared in front of Drona.

8. On seeing him, the brahmin Drona whose heart was highly delighted bowed to him with palms joined in reverence and eulogised him.

9. Satisfied and pleased with his eulogy and penance, lord Siva, favourably disposed towards his devotees told Drona — “Mention the boon you wish to choose”.

10. — On hearing the words of Siva, Drona bowed low and said “Please give me a son born of your part who will be invincible to every one and who will be very powerful.

11. On hearing the words of Drona, Siva said, “So be it.” O dear sage, the lord who bestows happiness, then vanished.

12. Drona returned to his abode highly delighted and free from illusion. He joyously narrated all the details to his wife.

13. Taking the due opportunity, lord Siva, the annihilator of all and very powerful was born as Drona’s son through a part of himself.

14. O sage, he became well known as A^vatthaman on the earth. He was heroic, had lotus-like eyes and he could reduce the strength of his enemy.

15. Securing the permission and behest of his father that famous hero helped the Kauravas in the Mahabharata war.

16. By resorting to that powerful hero, Rhlsma and other Kauravas became invincible even to the gods.

17. Fearing him, the Pandavas, though they were great heroes and very skilful, became incapable of conquering the Kauravas.

18. At the instance of Krsna, Arjuna performed the severe penance of Siva and obtained a divine missile due to Siva’s boon. He then conquered the Kauravas.

# Sivapurdna

19. O sage, although the great hero A£vatthaman was born of a part of lord Siva. Still due to his devotion to the Kauravas, he exhibited his full vigour.

20. He destroyed the sons of Pandavas though they were trained in warfare by Krsna and other great heroes. He had the strength that could not be withstood by the enemy.

21. On seeing Arjuna dejected by the death of his son but rushing on him along with Krsna he fled away from the battle-field.

22. He discharged the divine missile BrahmaSiras on Arjuna. Then a fierce splendour enveloping all the quarters manifested itself.

23. Sensing danger to his own life Arjuna was much distressed. Losing all his brilliance and highly frightened he spoke to Krsna becoming utterly exhausted. Arjuna said: O Krsna, O Krsna, what is this? Whence has it arisen I do not know. This unbearable fiery splendour comes from all sides.

Nandiivara said:

25. On hearing the words of Arjuna, Krsna the most excellent among the devotees of Siva meditated on Siva and Parvatl and then spoke to Arjuna.

Krsna said:

26. Know this to be the most powerful Brfihma missile of Asvatthaman. There is no other missile to counteract this.

27. Immediately think of Siva, your lord, the protector of the devotees who had given you a weapon capable of every action.

28. Counteract the fiery splendour of the Brahma missile with your Saiva missile. After saying this Krsna himself meditated on Siva for that purpose.

29. O sage, on hearing the words of Krsna, Arjuna remembered Siva, touched water, bowed to Siva and discharged the Saiva missile.

30. O great sage, although the Brahmasiras missile



---

never goes futile and cannot be counteracted, it subsided before the splendour of the Saiva missile.

# 31.

Do not consider this very surprising in Siva who is full of wondrous things and who, the unborn, creates, protects and annihilates the entire universe by his own power. O sage, knowing that happened by the influence of Siva, ASvatthaman, born of Siva’s part and delighted in heart at Siva’s wish, was not at all sorry.

# 32.

Then the son of Drona wishing the world to be rid of Pandava lineage desired to kill the child in the womb of Uttara.

# 33.

The powerful ASvatthaman hurled the excessively lustrous Brahma-missile that could not be countermanded by any other missile, aiming it at the womb of Uttara.

# 34.

Then Uttara the daughter-in-law of Arjuna, burning within due to that missile and agitated in the mind eulogised Krsna, the lord of Laksmi.

# 35.

Then meditating on Siva mentally, bowing to and eulogising him, Krsna understood that to be the missile of the son of Drona.

# 36.

By means of his missile the brilliant Sudarsana, bestowed on him by Siva for his protection, he saved her at the behest of Siva.

# 37.

ASvatthaman then knew that Krsna had assumed his form at the behest of Siva and did it as he was the foremost among the devotees of Siva, slowly refrained from the thought of destroying Uttara.

# 38.

Then the leading devotee of Siva, the delighted Krsna, made all the Pandavas fall at the feet of Asvatthaman for pleasing him.

# 39.

Then Asvatthaman, son of Drona, highly delighted in the mind, blessed the Pandavas and Krsna with various boons.

# 40.

O excellent *agc, incarnating thus on the earth in the form of Drona’s son, lord Siva performed various sports.

# (Instruction of Vyasa in the context of Siva's incarnation as Kirata)

NandUvara said:

1. O intelligent one, listen to the incarnation of the Pinaka-bearing lord Siva as Kirata who killed Muka and delightedly granted the boon to Arjuna.

2. Defeated by Suyodhana, the excellent Pandavas went to the forest Dvaita88 accompanied by their chaste wife Draupadi.

3. Depending upon the cooking-pot given by the sun, the Pandavas spent their time happily.

4. O leading brahmin, Durvasas the leading sage was induced by Suyodhana to go to the Pandavas in order to deceive them.

5. Accompanied by his ten thousand disciples he approached them and asked for foodstuffs and other things for his disciples.

6. After accepting it, Durv&#x26;sas and other sages and saints were sent by the Pandavas for their ablution.

7. O great sage, by want of food, all the Pandavas were sad and resolved to cast off their lives.

8. Krsrta appeared on being remembered by Draupadi.

88. According to the Mah&#x26;bh&#x26;rata (III. 24. 13) it was a sacred forest where Yudhisthira retired with his brothers after the loss of his kingdom at the gambling table. It has been identified with Devabandh or Ueoband in the Saharanpur district Uttara, Pradesh.

Draupadi. After eating a bit of vegetable he made them satiated at the very moment.

9. On coming to know that the disciples were fully satisfied Durvasas went away. By the grace of Kr$na, the Pandavas were freed from a difficult situation.

10. Then Athey asked Krsna “O lord, what will happen now? very powerful enemy has arisen. What shall be done at this moment.”

NandUvara said:

11. O sage, on being asked thus by the Pandavas, lord Krsna remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and spoke to them.

Lord Kr$na said:

12. O excellent Pandavas, now listen to the details of my experience involving service to Siva. After hearing you shall act accordingly.

13-14. I went to Dvaraka to conquer my enemies. After obeying the instructions of noble Upamanyu I propitiated lord Siva. I propitiated him for seven months in the excellent mountain Batuka. Thus Siva was pleased with me.

15. Standing there himself he fulfilled all my desires. By his power I acquired excellent efficiency in everything.

16. The lord, the bestower of worldly pleasures and salvation is propitiated by me even now. You too serve Siva, who is the bestower of happiness to all.

NandUvara said:

17. After saying thus and cheering the Pandavas, Kr$na vanished from there and remembering the lotus feet of Siva he hastened to Dvaraka.

18. Pandavas then sent a Bhilla to test the virtues and the strength of Duryodhana.

19. He understood the prosperity, rise and the virtues of Duryodhana and returned to the Pancjavas again.

20. On hearing what he had said, O great sage, the Pancjavas were very sad and in their distress spoke to one another.

21. What shall be done now? Where shall we go? Though we can fight now we have been restrained by the bonds of truth.

NandUvara said:

22. In the meantime Vyasa came there with the ashes decorating his forehead, with Rudraksa as an ornament and well bedecked in matted hair.

23. He was repeating the five-syllabled mantra. He was fully engrossed in the love of Siva. He was a heap of lustrous brilliance, a manifestation of virtue itself.

24. When they saw him they were delighted and they stood up to welcome him. Offering him a seat of deer-hide brightened by Kusa grass they waited in front of him.

25. When he was duly seated they honoured him with great delight after eulogising him in various ways and saying “Ah! we are blessed.”

26. “O holy lord, by seeing you, we are all satisfied. We have attained the fruits of our austerities and our diverse charitable gifts.

27. O grandfather, by seeing you, all our misery has disappeared, the misery that had been inflicted on us by the wicked people of ruthless activities.

28. Misery disappears at your sight. Was there ever a time when it did not disappear? We know it truly.

29. When a person reaches the hermitage of a sage efficient in all activities, if misery is not dispelled, fate alone is the cause there.

30. Poverty, the cause of misery, will surely be dispelled. Such is the nature of great men. In the fulfilment of desires they are equal to the wish-yielding Kalpa tree.

31. Thus the qualities of the great shall be observed objectively. A person becomes famous by merely resorting to them.

33. The characteristics of the wretched and the miserable are conducive to his glory, for there lies before him an opportunity for strenuous efforts and for serving the good people.

34. Thereafter it is one’s own destiny. No one is to blame for it. Hence O lord, when you are seen, everything auspicious takes place.

35. By your mere arrival our minds are satisfied. Give us instructions whereby our misery can be dispelled.

JVandifvara said:

36. On hearing the words of the Pandavas the great sage Vyasa was delighted in the mind and said thus.

37. O Pandavas, you need not be over-anxious. You are all blessed and contented. You have not let truth slip by.

38. The noble nature of the good remains unchanged even at death. They do not forsake virtue. They fruitfully resort to Truth.

39. As far as we are concerned, you and the Kauravas ought to be equal. Still our partiality is towards the virtuous. This partiality is approved by the learned.

40. Virtue was at the outset abandoned by the wicked and blind Dhrtarastra due to greed. Your kingdom was seized.

41. Undoubtedly you and they are his sons when your real father is dead. You are noble souls and hence you deserve to be viewed sympathetically.

42. Afterwards his son was never dissuaded by him. If only he had done so, this calamity would not have occurred.

43. Whatever has happened cannot be otherwise. He is wicked while all of you are virtuous and truthful.

44. Hence evil will befall only him in the end, to be sure. The seed that has been sown will germinate into a sprout.

45. Hence you need not feel distressed at all. Welfare will dawn on you. You need not entertain any doubt.

58. It is certain that the delighted Siva bestows everything on his devotees. He gives worldly pleasures here and salvation hereafter.

59. Hence Siva shall be always served by those who desire the fruits of worldly pleasures here and salvation hereafter. Siva, the divine Purusa himself, is the slayer of the wicked and the goal of the good.

60. But one shall repeat the lore of Indra at the outset with steady mind. For a Ksatriya of great lustre this alone is conducive to welfare.

61. Hence let Aijuna repeat the lore of Indra at first, steadily. In the beginning the lord will test him and will like to be satisfied with the test.

62. If he is delighted he will remove all obstacles. The lore will yield the granting of the boon by Siva.

Nandttvara said:

63. After saying this he called Arjuna and instructed him in the lore of Indra. Arjuna had his ceremonial bath and facing the east, he, of powerful intellect, received the lore.

64. The great sage gave him the rules of procedure for a king. The liberal-minded Vyasa thus spoke to Arjuna.

Vydsa said:

65. O Arjuna, start from here and go this way to the beautiful mountain Indraklla. There standing beside the river Ganga perform the penance well.

2. On seeing Arjuna the Pandavas were convinced. “Surely success will be ours, since Arjuna has achieved an extensive splendour.

3. The task can be achieved only by you and not by anyone else. It appears so through the words of Vyasa. Make your life fruitful.”

4. After saying this, all of them, dejected by the impending separation, reluctantly bade farewell to Arjuna.

5. The grief-stricken, chaste Draupadi, controlling her tears, bade farewell to Arjuna and said.

Draupadi said:

6. O king, you shall strenuously act according to the instructions of Vyasa. May your path be auspicious. May Siva be the benefactor.

NandUvara said:

9. In separation, misery is doubled. Even the boldest cannot retain his courage.

10. O great sage, while the Pancjavas were thus in grief, the excellent sage Vyasa, the ocean of mercy, arrived there.

11. The Pandavas honoured and bowed to him with respect after offering him a seat. In their misery they joined their palms in reverence and spoke.

# The Pandavas said:

12. O holy lord, O excellent sage, we are burning in grief but on seeing you we derive consolation and pleasure.

13. O lord, O brahmin sage, please stay here for sometime and dispel our grief. By your very sight our miseries are dispelled.

NandUvara said:

14. Thus requested, the excellent sage stayed there for their happiness, dispelling their grief by narrating various legends. O good sage, in the course of conversation pursued with Vyasa, Yudhistfiira bowed to him humbly and spoke.

# Yudhifthira said:

16. O excellent sage, listen. I seek for the alleviation of our grief. O intelligent one, I am putting this humble question. O lord, you shall kindly explain.

17. Has anyone formerly suffered this sort of grief? Verily we alone have had it. None else.

Vydsa said:

18. Formerly, Nala, the king of Ni$adha, the noble soul, had experienced a misery more than yours.

19. A great calamity and distress befell king Harilcand- ra. It cannot be adequately described. It makes others too distressed.

20. Nala, king of Nifadha, lost his kingdom in gambling to his rival Pu$kara and then wandered into the forest with his wife and suffered great privations. See Mbh. Vanaparva.

21. Harilcandra, son of TrisaAku and king of the solar race, had to suffer at the hands of the relentless sage Visv&#x26;mitra to whom he gave away his kingdom, son, wife, life and everything as the sacrificial gift.

20. O Pantjavas, even Rama94 had to suffer that misery on hearing which men and women would be greatly affected.

21. Hence it is very difficult to explain this misery. The body is a heap of miseries. Considering this, you shall eschew all miseries.

22. By this misery alone is the body held and pervaded. There is no doubt in this. At the outset, the very birth in the mother’s womb is a cause of misery.

23. Even in infancy and childhood there is great misery in child’s sports. In youth man experiences misery even while enjoying pleasures.

24. When days come and go, when burdens of tasks are born in plenty, the life nears its end every day. But man does not realize it.

25. In the end there is death. There is greater misery thereafter. There are different sorts of hellish trouble. All these are experienced by ignorant men.

26. Hence this world is untrue. You shall follow truth always. Man shall do such things as will satisfy Siva.

Nandi&#x26;vara said:

27. Thus the brothers spent their time by various talks, discussions and schemes of all sorts.

28-30. Arjuna went over impassable mountains for the practice of his steady rites. He met a Yaksa on the way and through him he slew many robbers.96 He was delighted in his mind and reached the excellent mountain. Near Ganga he saw a beautiful spot with A£oka groves. It was excellent like the heaven. He halted there, took his bath and bowed to his venerable preceptor.

31. He assumed dress and features according to his instructions. He curbed his sense organs and the mind and stood steady.

94. Rama, son of Dasaratha, had to roam into the forest for fourteen years owing to the jealousy of Kaikeyi who urged her husband Dasaratha to install her son Bharata and to send Rama into exile.

95. In the Vedas Dasyus are represented as the aboriginal tribesmen who contended with the immigrant Aryans and were overpowered by the latter. In the Purāṇas the term Dasyu means a barbarian, a robber or an outcaste.

32. He made a clay idol of Siva even and beautiful. In front of it he stood in meditation on the excellent heap of splendour.

33. He took baths thrice a day. He performed various sorts of worship. He performed the Upasti form of worship of Siva again and again.

34-35. Indra’s spies saw the splendour-column coming out of head. They were frightened by it. They thought within themselves, “When did he come in? Indra must be informed.” Saying so they went to Indra.

Indra’s spies said:

36. O lord of gods, we do not know who it is. Someone is performing a penance in the forest, a god, a sage, the sun or the fire.

37. We are scorched by his splendour and have come near you. We have told you the details. Please do what is proper.

Nandiivara said:

38. Thus informed by the spies, Indra, the enemy of mountains, understood whatever his son Arjuna desired to do. He dismissed them and decided to go there to test him.

39. O leading brahmin, Indra, the lord of Sacl, assumed the form of an elderly brahmin bachelor and went there to test him.

40. On seeing him come, Arjuna worshipped him. After eulogising him he stood in front of him and said, “Whence do you come now? Please tell me.”

41. The lord of gods thus requested by him spoke with a hint at testing his courage, out of love. The brahmin said:

42. O dear, why do you perform the penance in your prime of youth? Is it for salvation or for victory? In every respect this penance of yours is useless.

Nandiivara said:

43. Thus questioned by him he informed him of everything. On hearing that the brahmin spoke again.

The brahmin said:

# 44.

This is not proper on your part to pursue this penance for achieving happiness or for salvation by means of K?atraic rites, O excellent scion of the Kurus.

# 45.

Indra is the bestower of happiness and not of salvation. O excellent one, it behoves you therefore to perform a more excellent penance.

# 46.

On hearing his words Arjuna was angry. Slighting it but humbly, Arjuna of good rites replied.

# 47.

It is not for kingdom nor for salvation that penance is resorted to. Why do you speak like this? I am performing this penance on the advice of Vyasa.

# 48.

O bachelor, go hence. Do you wish to cause my downfall? Of what use is this to you a bachelor?

JVandUvara said:

On being addressed thus he was delighted. He revealed his wonderfully beautiful form with all paraphernalia to him.

On seeing the form of Indra, Arjuna was ashamed. Indra spoke to him again after consoling him.

On hearing the words of Indra, Arjuna replied: “Father, bless me with victory. I am afflicted by enemies in every respect.”

# 58.

I, Brahma and others, Vi$nu the bestower of boons and those who crave for victory are the devotees of Siva.

# 59.

Now onwards leave that mantra and worship Siva with devotion through the rules laid down for the worship of his clay phallic image and by contemplating on him.

# 60.

O Bharata, by your devotional feelings and modes of service, you worship Siva. Your achievement will be unshakable. No doubt need be entertained in this respect.

Nandtivara said —

# 61.

After saying this he called out his spies and said “All of you shall be cautious and attentive in protecting him always.”

# 62.

Thus alerting his spies for the protection to be accorded to Arjuna, Indra spoke again to Arjuna with his heart full of fondness and affection. Indra said: O Gentle one, O terrifier of enemies, you shall not commit blunders in the administration of your kingdom. This mantra will be conducive to your glory.

# 63.

Always courage shall be maintained by an aspirant. Siva the protector will give you riches and the fruits of your desire. This is undoubtedly true.

Nandttvara said:

# 64.

After giving the boon to Arjuna, the lord of gods remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and went to his abode.

# 65.

The heroic Arjuna bowing to the lord of gods, performed the penance with controlled mind with Siva as his goal.

# CHAPTER THIRTYNINE

(The demon MUka is killed in the context of the incarnation of Kirdta)

NandUvara said:

1. He performed the ablution duly, and the Nyasa (the mystic placing of fingers etc.) in accordance with the Sastric injunctions. He performed the meditation of Siva with great devotion in the manner explained by Vyasa.
2. Like a great sage, he stood on the sole of a single foot. He fixed one of his eyes at the sun and stood repeating the mantra.
3. Repeating the five-syllabled mantra of Siva the most excellent of all the mantras and mentally remembering Siva with pleasure he performed the penance.
4. The splendour of the penance was such that the gods were surprised. They went to Siva again and told him sincerely.

The gods said:

O lord of all, a penance is being performed by a man for your propiation. O lord, why don’t you grant him what he desires.

NandUvara said:

After saying this the gods eulogised him in different ways. Fixing their eyes to his feet they stood there in agony.
On hearing their words the lord of benevolent mind, the delighted Siva laughingly spoke thus to the gods.

Siva said:

O gods, you go to your abode. Undoubtedly I shall carry out your task in every respect.

NandUvara said:

On hearing those words of Siva, they became assured. They therefore returned to their abodes.

Satarudrasaifihitd 1241

10—13. In the meantime there came the demon Muka, instigated by the wicked Duryodhana, wielding Maya against Arjuna. O great brahmin, he had assumed the form of a boar.*6 He came along the path where Arjuna was staying. He was digging up the peaks of mountains and trees in plenty. He was roaring and grunting in diverse ways and was rushing at a great speed. On seeing the demon Muka, Arjuna remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and began to think. Arjuna said:

14. Who is this? Where does he come from? He seems to be very ruthless in actions. Certainly he is coming here to harm me.

15. It occurs to me that he is my enemy, to be sure. Formerly many Daityas and Danavas had been killed by me.

16. He may be one of those come here to wreak vengeance. Or he may be some friend of Duryodhana acting for his welfare.

17. Verily he is a benefactor on seeing whom the mind becomes pleased. If on seeing anyone the mind is agitated he is surely an enemy.

18. The conduct declares the family, the body declares the diet, the mode of speech declares the amount of learning and the eye indicates the affection.

19. The concealed mind is revealed by the general mien, the mode of walking, the activities, the speech, the features of the eyes and the face.07 —

20. The eye is of four sorts: the resplendent, the impassioned, the squinted and the ruddy. The features are likewise different, O scholars.

21. It is resplendent when friends meet. It is impassioned at the sight of the son. It is squinted in contact with the beloved and it is ruddy at the sight of the enemy.

96. The battle between Arjuna and Siva disguised as Kirata over the possession of an arrow that killed the boar, as described in Chs, 39, 40, 41 here, forms the main theme of Bharavi’s Kiiaiarjuniya.

97. Cp. Paficatantra I. 44.

22. In regard to him my sense-organs are excited. He must be an enemy. Undoubtedly he shall be killed. —“O

23. I remember the words of my preceptor now king, a person causing misery shall be killed by you by all means. No doubt need be entertained in this respect. It is only for this purpose that I hold the weapons. There is no doubt in this.” After thinking thus he placed the arrow ready there and stood up.

25-26. In the meantime, Siva, favourably disposed to his devotees, assumed the wonderful form of an efficient hunter and came there along with his Ganas in order to slay that Daitya, to protect Arjuna as well as to test his devotion.

27. The hunter had tucked up his lion-cloth and folded up Siva’s banner. His body was lined with the white ash. He held a bow and arrows.

28. He carried the quiver suspended over his back. The Ganas too assumed the form of hunters. Siva too became the chief of Bhillas.

29. The Commander-in-Chief started various sounds. The grunting sound of the boar too spread over the quarters.

30. Arjuna was excited by the sound that spread in the forest. Even the mountains were agitated by these sounds.

31. “Oh, can this be Siva the benefactor? I have heard about this as mentioned by Krsna.

32. Vyasa too has mentioned and the gods too. Siva is mentioned as the benefactor. Siva is the cause of happiness.

33. He is called “the bestower of salvation” because he bestows salvation upon his devotees. Undoubtedly welfare befalls those who remember his names.

34. Even in dreams, misery does not befall those who worship him with devotion. If it happens at all, it is due to their previous activities.

35. That must happen whether big or small. The fault is particularly that of the action that has begun to fructify.

36. Or Siva may dispel the misery by his will, after one has experienced the fruits of one’s action big or small.

37. He can convert poison into nectar and nectar.

into poison. Whatever he wishes he certainly does. How can an efficient man be thwarted?

38-40. Devotees of yore and future devotees must keep their mind steady after considering all those aspects, whether one is in affluent circumstances or not, whether death is imminent or not or whether people praise or censure. Misery is quelled. Siva is always the bestower of happiness through the merit and sin of individuals. Sometimes Siva makes us miserable in order to test us.

41. Since he is compassionate he is said to be the bestower of happiness ultimately. A gold piece can become pure only when it is put into the fire and purified.

42. This has been heard by me from the Sage. Hence I shall attain blessed happiness through his worship alone.

43. While he was musing thus, the boar came within the range of his arrow-discharge.

44-45. In order to protect Arjuna, Siva, favourably disposed towards his devotees, came there closely pursuing the boar. A wonderful horn was seen.

46. Then both of them discharged the arrow. Siva’s arrow hit the tail, Arjuna’s arrow hit the snout.

47-48. Siva’s arrow hit the tail and stopped at the snout. It struck the ground and entered it. Arjuna’s arrow pierced through the body. It came out of the tail and fell at its side. The boar who was a Daitya fell dead on the ground.

49. The gods were much delighted. They showered flowers. Bowing down and eulogising they cried shouts of victory.

50. On seeing the cruel form of the Daitya, Siva was glad and Arjuna was happy.

51-52. With an excessively happy mind Arjuna said, "this is a huge Daitya. He had assumed this wonderful form and had come here to kill me. But I have been saved by Siva. Lord Siva has given me keen intelligence. There is no doubt in this."

53. After thinking thus Arjuna repeated Siva’s name. He bowed to Siva and eulogised him again and again.

# CHAPTER FORTY

# [The Kirata-Arjuna dialogue]

NandUvara said:

1. O omniscient Sanatkumara, listen to the sport of the great soul Siva full of affection for the devotee and to the test of its stability.
2. Siva immediately sent his attendant to fetch the arrow. The Arjuna too came there.
3. The Gana and Arjuna reached the place simultaneously for the arrow. Arjuna rebuked him and took up his arrow. The Gana said—“O excellent sage, why do you take this arrow? The arrow is mine. Leave it off.”
4. O excellent sage, thus addressed by the Gana of the Bhilla, Arjuna remembered Siva and spoke.
5. Arjuna said: O forest-roamer, what do you say without understanding? You are a fool. This arrow had been discharged by me just now. How can it be yours?
6. It is engraved with my name in many lines. The feathers are mine. How does it become yours? You insist according to your wild nature.
7. NandUvara said: On hearing his words, the leader of the Ganas laughed and spoke to Arjuna who was in the garb of a sage.
8. O sage, listen. You are a sage in disguise. You are not a true sage. You do not perform penance. People are being deceived by you.
9. How can a saint utter a lie? Do not take me to be single-handed. Know me to be the commander-in-chief.
10. My master is sitting there with many hunters. In every respect, he is capable of destroying or blessing you.
11. It is his arrow that has been taken by you now. This arrow will never remain with you.
12. O sage, why do you wish to lose the fruit of your penance? Truly have I heard that penance is marked...

Satarudrasarhhitd
and wasted by theft, pride afflicted by deceit and the breaking of promise. Hence O sage, whence will you derive the fruit of penance?

15. If you do not give up this arrow you will be an ungrateful fellow. It was certainly to save you that my master discharged this arrow.

16. Your enemy has been killed by him and you have kept the arrow to yourself. Very ungrateful indeed are you. You are making your own penance fruitless.

17. You do not speak the truth. What you wish to gain thereby? If you have any need for the arrow, you may approach my master and request him.

18. He can give you many similar arrows. My master is here. Why don’t you request him?

19. Unmindful of his help to you, you wish him harm. This does not behove you. Eschew this fickleness.

20. On hearing his words, Arjuna, son of Pritha, was angry. After remembering Siva, he spoke these measured words.

Arjuna said: O hunter, explain. Your words are not true. You are a forest-wanderer, I know you. You are true to the caste in which you are born.

21. I am a king. You are a thief. How can a war be pursued? I must fight with people equal in strength to me, never with base people.

22. Your master will be only like you. You are the benevolent donors and you the forest-dwellers, thieves.

23. How can the king of foresters be requested by me now? O forest-wanderer, why don’t you beg the arrow of me?

24. I shall readily give you the arrows. Certainly I have many. If a king does not give what is taken, your objection may come up.

25. Then O forester, how can I simply give away the arrow, if what I am desirous of doing is not being understood? Why should there be long talk?

26-28. Let your master come and fight with me. Defeating me in the battle,

1246 Sivapwr&#x26;na let him take the arrow and return to his abode. Why should there be any delay?

NandUvara said:—

# 29.

On hearing these words of Arjuna who derived his strength from the mercy of lord Siva, the forester spoke these words.

# 30.

You are ignorant. You are not a sage. Why do you invite death? Give up the arrow and stay here happily or you will come to grief.

# NandUvara said:

# 31.

Thus challenged by the forester who derived his strength from Siva and who was a Gana, Arjuna, son of Pandu remembered Siva and said.

# Arjuna said:

O forester, listen attentively to my words. If your master comes here I shall show my strength.

# 32.

It does not behove me to fight with you. I shall fight with your master. The fight between a lion and a jackal is very ridiculous.

# 33.

You have heard my words. You shall see my strength now. O Bhilla, return to your master. Do as you please.

# NandUvara said:

# 34.

O sage, thus addressed by Arjuna, the Bhilla returned to the place where the general Kirata, the incarnation of Siva, stood.

# 35.

He mentioned Arjuna’s talk in detail to lord Siva, the great soul in the form of Bhilla.

# 36.

On hearing his words, lord Kirata was much delighted. It was Siva dressed as a Bhilla who had come there with his army.

# 37.

On seeing Kirata with his army, Arjuna, son of Pandu, took up his bow and arrows and faced him.

# 38.

Then Kirata sent the messenger again and



---


# Satarudrasartihita

through him delivered the message to Arjuna, the great soul.

Kirata said: O sage, see this army coming. Give up the arrow and go away. Why do you seek death for a trifle.

Your brothers are in distress. Your wife is grief-stricken. I think your kingdom will slip off your hands, I am sure.

NandiSvara said:

It was just to test the firmness of Arjuna that the great lord said this, the great lord Siva who had assumed that form to protect Arjuna by all means.

What the lord said, the Gana of Siva mentioned that to Arjuna in detail after approaching him.

On hearing that, Arjuna replied to the messenger, “You shall tell your general that the reverse of what he says will happen to him.

If I were to give up the arrow that belongs to me I shall be the cause of ignominy to my family.

Well may my brothers be distressed. Let all knowledge be fruitless. So, come on to fight with me.

No lion is ever frightened of a jackal. A king is never afraid of a forester.”

Thus replied by Arjuna the Bhilla returned to his master and conveyed all that Arjuna had said.

Lord Siva, a Kirata, heard the message and approached Arjuna along with his army.

# CHAPTER FORTYONE

# ( The incarnation of lord Siva as Kirata)

NandUvara said:

1. On seeing him come, Arjuna meditated on Siva and fought with him a terrible battle.
2. He was severely afflicted by the Ganas with many sharp weapons. Thus tortured by them Arjuna remembered lord Siva.
3. Arjuna split the arrows discharged by Kirata and his ganas. Then he thought upon Siva.
4. When distressed by him, the Ganas fled to the quarters. Then Siva summoned the chief Ganas. But they did not respond to his call.
5. Siva and Arjuna of great strength and exploit fought each other with various weapons of war.
6. Taking pity on him Siva approached Arjuna, but Arjuna hit him heavily.
7. Siva split the weapons of Arjuna as well as his armour. Aijuna stood in his bare body.
8. Although afflicted by fear, Arjuna remembered Siva and fought a duel with the general spiritedly.
9. The earth along with the oceans shook due to their fight. “What will happen now?” Thinking thus, the gods were distressed.
10. In the meantime, lord Siva stood in mid-air and fought. Arjuna too did likewise.
11. Flying at each other, lord Siva and the earthly king Arjuna fought with each other. On seeing that wonderful battle the gods were surprised.
12. Then Arjuna came to the ground, remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and caught hold of his feet deriving sufficient strength, thanks to his meditation on Siva.
13. Catching hold of his feet, Arjuna whirled him. Lord Siva, favourably disposed towards his disciples, laughed indulging in divine sports.
14. O sage, it was surely done by Siva himself who is subservient to his devotees. It could not be otherwise as this was just to grant him his devotion.

# Satarudrasarhita

15. Then Siva smiled and revealed his wonderful auspicious form as he is always well disposed to his devotees.

16-17. On seeing that beautiful form, the form of the excellent supreme being as mentioned in the Vedas, Sastras and Puranas, the form which Vyasa had advised him to meditate upon, the form which bestows all Siddhis, the form of Siva, Arjuna was abashed and surprised much.

18. “Ha, this is Siva, this is Siva who has been chosen by me as my lord, the lord of the three worlds himself. O what a thing have I committed now!

19. Powerful indeed is the Maya of the lord. It deludes even the wielders of Maya. Why have I been deceived by the lord who concealed his own form.”

20. After thinking thus within himself he joined his palms in reverence and bending his head he bowed to the lord with pleasure. Then he spoke in a delighted manner. Arjuna said:

O 21. O great god, O lord of gods, O Siva the merciful, lord of all, my fault shall be forgiven by you.

22. What you have done? By concealing your own form you have deceived me now. Fie on me who fought with you, my master, O lord.

Nandttvara said:

23. Thus Arjuna, son of Pandu, repented. He fell at the feet of lord Siva.

24. Cheering up in various ways the delighted lord Siva, favourably disposed to his devotees, replied to Arjuna.

Siva said: O Arjuna, do not worry yourself. You are a great devotee of mine. I have done this just to test you. Give up your sorrow.

Nandifvara said:

26. After saying this and lifting Arjuna with his own hands, the lord rid him of his bashfulness through his own lordly qualities. Arjuna, son of Pandu, honoured by

# Siva said:

28. O Arjuna, foremost among the sons of Pandu, I delighted. Choose your boon. By your hits and blows I have been worshipped by you. I consider it so.

29. This has been done by my own will. The fault is not yours. There is nothing which cannot be given to you. Choose whatever you desire.

30. In order to establish the rule of your fame among your enemies what you have done is auspicious. You shall not be struck with grief. Eschew all your feebleness.

# NandUvara said:

31. Thus addressed by lord Siva, Arjuna stood carefully and spoke to Siva with devotion.

# Arjuna said:

32. O good lord, O Sadasiva, is your desire, is your compassion to be described by me? You are the favourite of your devotees, you are Siva, the bestower of welfare.

33. After saying this, the son of Pandu eulogised Siva the great lord, devotedly, in the manner approved of by the Vedas.

34. “Obeisance to you the lord of gods. Obeisance to you the resident of Kailasa. O Sada^iva, obeisance to you. Obeisance to you, the five-faced one.

35. Obeisance to Kapardin (one with matted hair), obeisance to you, the three-eyed. Obeisance to the delighted one, obeisance to the thousand-faced.

Obeisance to the one who blessed me in the form of Kirata. Obeisance to the one who is fond of fighting with heroes, obeisance to the one performing various sports.

Whatever splendid form is seen, its splendour is yours. You are in the form of pure consciousness. You sport about in the three worlds in different guises.

There is no limit to your excellences as that of the dust particles, or stars in the sky or rain-drops.

Even the Vedas cannot enumerate your good qualities. O lord, how can I, deficient in intellect, describe any?

Whatever be your nature, obeisance be to you. It behoves you to take pity. O lord, I am your slave. O lord Siva, you are my master.

Once Siva visited a forest in the guise of a ^ᵉⁿᵈlᶜᵒⁿᵗ and the sages by his physical splendour. The sages charmed the wives of and by magical arts caused resentment of his action, dug a pit. But Siva slew the tiger and took his skin which, he belonged to the Asura Gaja (or Gaya) who had conquered the gods and destroyed the sages. Siva used slain the Asura, ripped the hide and stripped of the hide and used it as a cloak. See SP. Rudra. Yuddhakin^a, Gh. 57.

# 36.

All desires fructify at the sight and touch of the great lord. Thereafter salvation too is attained.

# 37.

With the blessings of Siva, and pleased with Gautama, the holy river Ganga, the beloved of Siva, stayed there in the name of Gautami.

# 38.

The ninth incarnation is glorified as Vaidyanatha. The lord indulging in many sports manifested himself for the sake of Ravana.

# 39.

Under the pretext of fetching him, lord Siva was installed in the cremation ground in the form of Jyotirlinga.

# 40.

The lord in the name of Vaidyanatha became famous in the three worlds. Seeing and worshipping him with devotion yields worldly pleasures and salvation.

# 41.

O sage, this benedictory passage referring to the greatness of Siva in the name of Vaidyanathesvara yields worldly pleasures and salvation to those who read and listen.

# 42.

The incarnation of Nagesvara is glorified as the tenth one. The lord manifested himself as the chastiser of the wicked for his devotees.

# 43.

He killed the Raksasa Daruka, a violator of virtue. He saved his devotee Supriya who was a merchant king.

# 44.

In order to help all the worlds, Siva, the great indulgent in sports, remained there assuming the form of Jyotirlinga, accompanied by Parvati.

# 45.

O sage, at the sight of Siva’s phallic image named Nagesvara and thanks to its worship, heaps of great sins perish immediately.

# 46.

O sage, the incarnation of Siva is the eleventh one. It was pleasing to Rama and it was installed by him.

# 49.

The grandeur of Rame'vara in the world was wonderful and incomparable, yielding worldly pleasures and salvation and bestowing the desires of the devotees ever.

# 50.

The man who performs the ablution of Ramelvara is really a living liberated soul.

# 51.

After enjoying all worldly pleasures here, and then getting perfect knowledge, he shall obtain salvation hereafter.

# 52.

The incarnation of Siva as GhuSmesvara is the twelfth wherein the lord indulged in different sports and conferred bliss on GhuSma. He is favourably disposed towards his devotees.

# 53.

O sage, the lord manifested himself in the Devasaila in the southern quarter acting favourably to GhuSma.

# 54.

Siva who is favourably disposed towards his devotees entirely revived the son of GhuSma who was killed by Sudehya. He was so pleased with her devotion.

# 55.

At her request, Siva stayed in the lake in the form of Jyotirliriga GhuSmeSvara conferring desires to the devotees.

# 56.

The man who sees that phallic image and worships it with devotion enjoys happiness here and attains salvation hereafter.

# 57.

Thus I have explained to you the series of divine Jyotirlingas twelve in number yielding both worldly pleasures and salvation.

# 58.

He who reads or listens to this narrative of Jyotirlingas becomes freed of all sins and derives worldly pleasures and salvation.

# 59.

Thus I have described the compendium Satarudra by name which glorifies the hundred incarnations of Siva and yields the fruits of desires.

# CHAPTER ONE

# (The greatness of Jyotirlihgas and their Upalihgas)

1. Obeisance for ever to that brilliance, half of whose body has been beautified by the daughter of the mountain; who, rid of all aberrations, assumes the shape of the worlds by means of his own Maya; whose sympathetic glance, they say, brings about the wealth and glory in the form of heaven and salvation and whom the Yogins see in their hearts as the one without a second and as the inner understanding and bliss.

2. May that mass of splendour, whatever it be, be auspicious, the splendour that has eyes gentle due to compassion; which has lotus-like face smiling charmingly; which is brilliant with the digit of the moon; which subdues the terrible three-fold distresses; whose body of excessive bliss, existence and knowledge sheds brightness; and which is encircled by the arms of the daughter of the mountain, Parvati.

The sages said:

3. O Suta, the greatness of the incarnations of Siva inclusive of their narratives, has been well explained by you with a desire for the welfare of the world.

4. O dear, may the excellent grandeur of Siva be narrated with pleasure in connection with his phallic forms. You are blessed and the most excellent among the devotees of Siva. Listening from your lotus-like mouth, O holy lord,

5. to the nectar-like glory of Siva, we are never satiated. Let the same sweet narrative be repeated.

6-7. O disciple of Vyasa, with a desire for the welfare of the worlds, please narrate in detail those divine phallic images of the great Lord whether they be on the earth in

the different holy centres or in other places glorified by men.

SQta said:

1. O brahmins, O excellent sages, you have asked well. I shall explain them in brief with a desire for the welfare of the worlds and due to my affection for you.
2. O sage, there is no limit to the number of phallic images. The entire earth, the entire universe is in the form of a phallus.
3. The holy centres are equipped with phallic images. Everything is founded on these. There is no limit to their number. I shall mention a few of them.
4. Whatever is seen, described or remembered is Siva’s form. Nothing other than that has real existence.
5. Still I shall explain in the manner I have heard. Let it be heard with pleasure O excellent sages, whatever images are there on the earth in the Patala or in heaven, everywhere Siva is worshipped by the gods, Asuras and human beings.
6. O excellent ones, the three worlds consisting of the gods, Asuras and human beings are pervaded by Siva in the form of phallic image for the welfare of the worlds.
7. In order to bless the worlds, lord Siva assumes different phallic forms here in the holy centres as well as in other places.
8. Siva incarnates in those places wherever he is devoutly remembered by the devotees. After carrying out their task he stations himself there.
9. He has assigned his phallic form for the benefit of the worlds. The devotee attains perfection by worshipping that form. O noble no number
10. acetics, there is limit to the of his phallic images on the earth. Still I narrate the important ones.
11. Even among the important ones, I shall enumerate the principal ones, on hearing which a man instantly gets rid of his sins.
12. O excellent one, I shall mention the most

KofirudrasartihitS
# 1261

important of the Jyotirlingas on hearing which a person becomes sinless.

# 21-24.

He who reads or recites the twelve names early in the morning is freed from all sins and attains the fruits of all Siddhis. The twelve Jyotirlingas are—Somanitha in Sauragtra, Mallikarjuna in SrHaila, Mahakila in Ujjayini, Paramefvara in Omkara, Kedara on the Himavat, Bhima-Sankara in Dakin!, Viive4a in Varanasi, Tryambaka on the bank of the Gautami, Vaidyanatha in the cremation ground, Nageia in the Daruka forest, Ramefa at Setubandha and Ghufmesa at Sivalaya.

# 25.

O great sages, such excellent men will attain those desires for which they recite the names.

# 26.

Those who recite them without any desire but with purity of mind will never have rebirth involving residence in the mother’s womb.

# 27.

By worshipping these, people of all castes get their miseries destroyed in this world and become liberated hereafter, to be sure.

# 28.

The food offerings of these Jyotirlingas shall be taken and others shall be fed with the same. Such acts reduce the sins to ashes instantaneously.

# 29.

O brahmins, the results of the worship of Jyotirlingas cannot be described adequately by Brahmi and others.

# 30.

Even if one of them is worshipped continuously for six months, the misery of rebirth in the mother's womb will never recur.

# 31.

Even if a person of base birth happens to see Jyotirlinga, he will be born in a pure and good family.

# 32.

Being born in a good family he will become rich and master all the Vedas. Then by performing auspicious rites, he shall attain liberation without any obstacle.

# 33.

O great sages, whoever he may be, an outcaste, a slave or an eunuch, he will be born as a brahmin and become liberated. Hence one shall view the Jyotirlinga.

# 34.

O excellent sages, a few of the fruits of the Jyotirlingas have been narrated by me. Let the UpaliAgas (ancillary phallic forms) of these Jyotirlingas be listened to.

# SivapurfaO

The sages said:

# 5.

O Suta, O fortunate Suta, O how was the excessively divine Siva born as AtrKvara? one of excellent rites, please narrate it.

# 6.

Suta said: O great sages, you have put the question well. I shall narrate the story on hearing which constantly one is relieved of sins.

# 7-8.

There is a great forest Kamada¹²⁷ in the south near Citrakufa. It is beneficient to the good in the performance of penance. There the son of Brahma, the sage Atri, performed a severe penance accompanied by Anasuya.

# 9.

O sage, formerly once, there was a great draught there, extending to a hundred years which put all living beings to distress.

# 10.

O great sages, the trees became dry then without sprouts or fruits. No water was seen anywhere even for daily routine work.

# 11.

There was no greenery anywhere. The winds blew dry and rough. There was a painful hue and cry all over the earth.

# 12.

On seeing the dissolution of all living beings, the chaste lady, the beloved wife of Atri said to her husband, "I cannot bear this distress."

# 13.

The sage then sat in the yogic pose, repeated the Pranayama three times and sank into the yogic trance.

# 14.

Atri, the great sage of perfect knowledge, meditated on Siva devoid of aberrations, the great splendour stationed in the soul, through his own soul.

# 15.

When the preceptor sank into meditation his disciples unable to get food deserted the sage, their preceptor, and went away.

# 16.

Anasuya the chaste lady then was left all alone.

# 17-18.

She joyously served the sage constantly. Making a beautiful clay image through mantras in accordance with the rules, she worshipped Siva through mental modes of.

service. After serving Siva repeatedly she eulogised him with devotion.

# 19-21.

Anasuya the well behaved wife of the sage circumambulated her lord and Siva. After prostration she went round anticlockwise too. On seeing that beautiful lady the Daityas and Danavas were excessively agitated by her brilliance. They kept themselves away as people do from a blazing fire.

# 22.

O leading brahmins, Anasuya’s service to Siva performed sacredly through mind, speech and body surpassed even the penance of Atri.

# 23.

As long as the sage was engrossed in Pranayama, the gentle lady continued her service.

# 24.

O excellent sage, the couple thus engaged in their activities remained there, alone.

# 25.

Thus a long time elapsed. The excellent sage, sunk in great meditation did not wake up at all.

# 26.

Anasuya the chaste lady worshipped only her lord and Siva. That chaste lady did not care to know anything else.

# 27-28.

On account of his penance and her worship the gods and the sages, Ganga and the rivers came there in order to see them with pleasure.

# 29-30.

On seeing his penance and her service they were surprised. On seeing their wonderful activity they asked one another, “Which of the two— the penance or service, is the greater?” They themselves replied “Atri’s penance is good but Anasuya’s service is better”.

# 31.

On seeing their performance some said “Her service is better.” Others said “Difficult penances had been performed by sages of yore but nothing like Atri’s penance was ever performed by any”.

# 32-33.

The sage is blessed. Anasuya is blessed, since great penance is pursued by these with great pleasure. If there be a person performing such an auspicious, difficult and excellent penance anywhere in the three worlds, we do not know.

# 34.

After praising them thus, they went away but only Ganga and Siva were left.

Gaiigi said :

1. “Delighted in worshipping us the chaste lady is too much engrossed in virtuous rites. I shall help her and then go.”
2. O great sages, Siva too, drawn by the meditation of Atri, stationed himself there in full digits. He did not go to Kailasa. O excellent sages, years had elapsed.
3. There was no rain at all.
4. As long as the sage was in meditation and penance, Anasuya decided not to eat anything. Now listen to what happened when the sage was performing penance and Anasuya continued her service.

# CHAPTER FOUR

# (The greatness of Atritvara)

SUta mid :

1. Once that great sage Atri, the foremost among the knowers of Brahman woke up and spoke to his wife “Give me water.”
2. Of course the chaste lady took the water pot and went into the forest. (But she began to muse) “Whence can I fetch water? What shall I do? Where shall I go? How can water be fetched?” Wondering thus she saw Ganga.
3. By the time she went over to her, Ganga, the most excellent river, assumed a beautiful form and spoke to her.

GaAgi said:

O gentle lady, I am delighted with you. Where are you going? Tell me now. O fortunate lady, you are blessed. I shall truly carry out your behest.

SSta said :

On hearing her words the saintly woman, the wife of the sage, was greatly surprised O brahmins. She replied with great pleasure.

# Kofirudrasarhhitd

AnasUyd said:

7. O beautiful lady with eyes like lotus-petals, whence have you come? Please tell me the truth. A chaste lady speaks good words.

Suta scAd:

8. O great sages, when the wife of the sage spoke thus, the divine formed Ganga, the foremost of the rivers, said.

Ganga said:

9. O chaste lady, on seeing the service rendered by you unto your lord and to Siva the great soul and on taking view of your holy rites, I am staying near you.

10. O lady of pure smiles, I am Ganga come here attracted by your worship. Choose whatever you wish.

Suta said:

On hearing what Ganga said, the chaste lady bowed to her and said, “If you are pleased madam, give water now.”

12. On hearing her words Ganga said—“Dig a pit.”

She then made a pit in a trice, came and stood before her.

13. Ganga entered the pit which became full of water. In surprise, Anasuya took the water.

14. Anasuya the wife of the sage spoke for the welfare of the people to Ganga, the excellent river of divine form.

Anasuyd said:

15. If you are delighted, if you have sympathy for me you will please stay here till my husband comes.

Suta said:

On hearing the words of Anasuya pleasing to the good, the delighted Ganga said, “O sinless lady, you will give my water to Atri.”

16. When Ganga said thus, Anasuya acted accordingly. She gave the divine water to her lord and stood before him.

17. The sage performed the Acamana duly with great pleasure and drank the divine water. On drinking it he derived great happiness.

1270

19. “O this is not the water usually drunk by me.” After thinking thus he suddenly looked all round.

20. On seeing the trees dry and withered and the quarters rough and arid, the excellent sage spoke to her “No rain has fallen?”

21. On hearing what he said, the beloved lady replied in the negative. He then asked her whence she brought that water for him.

22. When he said this, O great sages, Anasuya was much surprised. She then thought within herself.

23. “If I tell him the truth it will be the exhibition of my greatness. If I do not tell him, it will be a violation of my rites.

24. I shall tell him in a manner to avoid the contingencies. Even as she was musing thus, she was asked again and again.

25. Then, thanks to the blessings of Siva, an intelligent idea struck her mind. “O lord, please hear me. I shall tell you what has happened.”

Anasuya said:

26. “Thanks to the power of Siva and your merits, Ganga has come here herself. This is her water, to be sure.”

Suta said:

27. On hearing this, the sage was surprised in his mind. Remembering Siva mentally he spoke to his beloved with great pleasure.

Atri said: O beloved, O beautiful lady, whether you speak truth or lie, I cannot believe it. This is something rare.

28. O auspicious lady, how did that happen which is impossible even to the yogins and the gods. I am extremely surprised.

29. If I see that myself I shall believe it, not otherwise.

On hearing his words the beloved wife spoke to the husband:

Ko firudrasa rfihiid 1271

Anasuya said:

# 31.

O lord, O great sage, please come with me if you wish to see Ganga, the foremost among the rivers.

# 32.

After saying this and remembering Siva, the chaste lady took her husband to the place where Ganga, the foremost among the rivers was present.

# 33.

There the chaste lady showed to her husband Ganga of divine form stationed within the pit.

# 34.

Going there and seeing the beautiful pit full to brim with water, the excellent sage said “She is blessed.”

# 35.

“Is this the fruit of my own penance or of somebody else?” After saying this the leading sage eulogised her with devotion.

# 36.

Then the sage took a clean bath in that excellent water. After performing the Acamana he eulogised her again and again.

# 37.

Anasuya too took her bath in that beautiful, clear water. The sage performed the routine rites. Anasuya too, of good rites, performed likewise.

# 38.

Then Ganga told her “I am returning to my place.” When this was said, the chaste lady spoke to the leading river again.

Anasuya said:

# 39.

O goddess if you are delighted, if you are kind to me, you will stay in this penance-grove for ever.

# 40.

This is the nature of the great that once they accept a request they will never forego it. After expressing her desire with joined palms, she eulogised her again and again. The sage likewise—“O leading river, you shall stay. O goddess, be favourable to us bless us your support.”

# 41.

On hearing his pleasing words, the leading river Ganga was delighted in her mind and spoke to Anasuya.

Ganga said:

# 43.

I shall stay back for helping the gods if you pass

1272 on to me a year’s merit accruing to you by worshipping lord Siva.

44. I am not so much satisfied with charitable gifts, or ceremonial ablutions in the holy centres or sacrifices or the practice of Yogic rites as I am satisfied with chastity.

45. O chaste lady, this is the truth I speak that the mind is not so pleased by any other means as it is pleased at the sight of a chaste lady.

46. On seeing a chaste lady, all my sins have perished. I have become purified and like Parvati have become chaste.

47. If you seek for welfare, you give up that merit for the benefit of the world, then I shall become steady and stable here.

Suta said:

48. On hearing these words, the chaste Anasuya passed on a year’s merit to Gariga.

* 49. It is the nature of the great that they do what is beneficial to others. The instance of gold-sandal and sugar-cane juice may be cited.

50. On seeing this performance of Anasuya, a chaste woman, Lord Siva was delighted and appeared out of his earthen phallic form.

Siva said:

51. O chaste lady, on seeing this activity of yours I am delighted. Mention the boon you wish to choose, since I am very fond of you.

52. Then the couple glanced at the wonderfully beautiful form of Siva. On seeing five-faced Siva they were much surprised.

53. Bowing to and eulogising Siva, the benefactor of the worlds, the couple endowed with great devotion spoke to him after worshipping him.

The couple said:

54. O lord of gods, if you are delighted, if the mother of the universe is also delighted, please stay in this penance-grove and be the bestower of happiness to the worlds.



---


55. Then the river Ganga was delighted. Siva too was pleased. They stayed at the hermitage of the excellent sage.

56. Lord Siva, the destroyer of miseries was known as AtrHvara. Ganga too stayed in the pit by her magical power.

57. Thence onwards there is a perennial supply of water in that pit deep only by a hand’s length. Ganga flows gently there.

58. Divine sages came there with their womenfolk and the sages who had formerly gone out of the various holy centres returned.

59. Barleys and food-grains were plenty. People interested in sacrifices performed these accompanied by the sages.

60. O great sages, delighted with these rites, clouds showered in plenty. There was great bliss in the world.

61. Thus the greatness of Atrilvara has been explained to you. It is pleasing and conducive to worldly pleasures and salvation. It yields all desires and enhances devotion.

# (The Brahmin lady attains heaven)

SUta said:

1. There was a fine cow tied up in the courtyard. The brahmin of the house who had gone out returned after nightfall. O great sages, on seeing the cow, tethered in the courtyard, not yet milked, the distressed brahmin desirous of milking it told his wife.

4. O sages, the owner of the house, the brahmin, desirous of milk tried to tie up the calf to the peg.

5. Dragged by the leg the calf kicked. O great one of good rites, the brahmin was put to pain.

6. Infuriated by the kick of the calf, he hit the calf severely with the pieces of firewood.

7. Hit by him the calf became utterly exhausted. Due to anger neither the cow was milked nor the calf was untied by the brahmin.

8. For the pleasure of getting milked, the cow mooed loudly. On hearing the mooing sound of the cow, the calf said.

The calf said:

9. “O mother, why do you cry? What is the misery that has befallen you? Please tell me lovingly.” On hearing this, the cow said.

10. “O son, listen to me. Although I am unable to express my grief adequately, you have been hit by the wicked man. Hence I am distressed.”

Sdta said:

11. On hearing his mother’s words, the calf taking his stand by the principle of previous action replied enlightening his mother.

12. “What should be done? Where should we go? Since the results are bound by previous actions, we experience joy or sorrow accordingly.

13. Activities are pursued with pleasure and fruits are derived sorrowfully. There is none who gives misery and none who gives happiness.

14. This is a wrong notion that another man gives us sorrow or pleasure. This is also an illusory concept that it is I who do this or that.

15. Misery or happiness results from our own actions. Hence action is prominent and everything is founded on action.

16. You the mother, I the child and all the living beings are bound by action. They are not to be bewailed by you.

Suta said:

1. On hearing these words of her calf full of wisdom, the distressed cow sorrowing for her calf, said thus.
2. The cow said:
3. “O dear son, I know fully well that all the people are subservient to their actions. Still, seized by Maya I feel much distressed.

I have cried a lot but the sorrow has not subsided.” On hearing these words, the calf spoke to her again.
4. The calf said:
5. If you know thus, can anything be gained by crying? Hence leave off your sorrow.

Suta said:
6. On hearing the words of her son, the distressed cow heaved a deep sigh and spoke to the calf.

The cow said:
7. My distress will disappear only when a similar misery befalls the brahmin. I am telling you the truth.

Tomorrow morning I shall hit him by my horns. No doubt, when hit he will lose his life.
8. The calf said:
9. The fruit of previous actions we experience now. What is the fruit you are going to reap as a result of this brahmin-slaughter?

When merits and demerits are on a par one takes birth in Bharata. O mother, when they are wiped off by enjoyment or suffering, liberation is achieved.
10. Some time the action is destroyed, some time the action results. That is why you have begun to perform this misdeed.
11. Whence am I your son? Whence are you my mother? This fond consciousness of sonhood and motherhood is futile. Ponder.
12. Where is mother? Where is father? Where is

29. O mother, knowing thus you cast off your misery strenuously. If there is a desire for pleasure hereafter you shall do good deeds here.

The Cow said:

30. O son, I know this but delusion does not forsake me. I am much distressed by your misery. I shall return tit for tat.

31. I know the place that dispels the sin of brahmin-slaughter. Going there I can get rid of the sin of Brahmin-slaughter.

Sdta said:

32. O excellent brahmins, on hearing these words of the mother cow, the calf observed silence. It did not say anything more.

33. O great sages, on hearing this wonderful dialogue between the two, the pilgrim brahmin was surprised and he thought within himself.

34. “I shall leave in the morning only after seeing the wonderful sequel. I shall go to that holy spot myself.”

35. O brahmins, after thinking thus the pilgrim-brahmin, devoted to his mother, became surprised. He and his servant went to sleep.

36. When the day dawned, the owner of the house got up. Awakening the traveller he spoke these words.

Ths brahmin said:

37. “Why do you sleep? It is already day-break. Go on your journey — place where you go.”

He replied:

38. “Please listen, brahmin, there is acute pain in the stomach of my servant. We will stay a little longer and go thereafter.”

Suta said:

39. Creating such a pretext the man continued to sleep, desiring to know the details of the wonderful incident that had surprised him much.

1280 Sivapurifya

40. At the time of milking, the brahmin who wanted to go somewhere on some business spoke to his son. The father said:

41. O son, I am going out on some business. Dear, you shall carefully milk our cow.

Sata said:

42. After saying this, the brahmin left the house. Thereafter the son got up and untied the calf.

43-44. The cow approached him herself for being milked. The brahmin’s son, eager for milk, took the distressed calf hit by his father near the cow in order to tie it up. The infuriated cow hit him with her horn.

45-46. The boy, hit in a vulnerable point, fell unconscious. People gathered there, saying— “O, the boy is struck by the cow. Fetch water? fetch water?” By the time they attempted to do something, the boy died.

47. When the boy died, there was a great hue and cry. His mother was struck with grief. She cried again and again.

48. “What shall I do? Where shall I go? Who can remove my grief?” After lamenting thus she struck the cow and let it off.

49. The cow which had been white in colour turned black immediately. People cried to one another “O see O see.”

50. On seeing this surprising event the brahmin traveler set out and followed the cow as it ran away.

51-52. Lifting up its tail, the cow ran off to the river Narmada. Coming near the Nandike£a shrine, it dipped itself into the waters of the Narmada thrice. It regained its white colour and went away the way it came. The brahmin was surprised.

53. Ah, blessed indeed is this holy centre that removes the sin of Brahmin-slaughter. The brahmin and the servant took their baths there.

54. After the holy dip they started on their journey praising the river. On the way they met a beautiful maiden fully bedecked in ornaments.

She said:

# 55.

“O brahmin-traveller where do you go in such bewilderment? Eschewing all deceit tell me the truth here,

# 56.

On hearing these words, the brahmin narrated everything truthfully. The brahmin was again addressed by the women, “Stay here”.

# 57.

On hearing her words, the brahmin replied humbly “Speak out what you desire to say.

# 58.

She said again “In the holy spot that you have just seen, cast off the bones of your mother. Why shall you go elsewhere?

# 59.

O excellent traveller, your mother will assume a divine form and will immediately attain the good goal of Siva.

# 60.

O excellent brahmin, in the month of Vailakha on the auspicious seventh day in the bright half, Ganga comes here always.

# 61.

Today is that seventh day. The river is in the form of Ganga there.” Saying so the lady vanished. O excellent sages, she was Ganga herself.

# 62.

The brahmin returned. As soon as he cast off half the bones of his mother from his bundle into the holy river, a wonderful incident happened.

# 63-64.

He saw his mother endowed with a divine form. She said—“You are blessed. You have fulfilled your duty. The family has been sanctified by you. May your wealth, food-grains, longevity and line flourish.” Blessing her son frequently, she went to heaven.

# 65.

After enjoying excellent happiness there for a long time, she attained the excellent goal, thanks to the grace of Siva.

# 66.

Her son, the brahmin, cast off the remaining bones too. He was much delighted in his mind. With contented soul he returned to his abode.

# CHAPTER SEVEN

# (The greatness of NandikeSvara)

The sages said:

1. O holy lord, Suta, narrate in detail how Ganga came to Narmada on the seventh day in Vaiṣakha.
2. How did the lord come to be known by the name Nandikeśa? O intelligent one, narrate that too with pleasure.

Sūta said: O excellent sages, you have put a very good question concerning Nandikeśa. I shall narrate it as it enhances merit.

A brahmin lady Ṛsika, the daughter of a certain brahmin, was duly married to a certain brahmin youth.
O leading brahmins, although she observed holy rites, the brahmin lady became a widow at an early age as a result of previous actions.
Then the brahmin widow, observing the rite of celibacy performed a severe penance by worshipping Siva’s earthen phallic image.
In the meantime, a wicked and very powerful Asura named Mudha came there. He, the wielder of great Maya, was struck by the arrows of the cupid.
On seeing that charming beautiful lady performing penance, he offered her many temptations and requested for sexual pleasure with her.
O great sages, the lady observing holy rites and engrossed in Siva’s meditation did not cast a loving glance at him.
She did not honour him. Engaged in penance she remained meditating upon Siva and strictly continued her penance.
That leading Daitya, Mudha, when slighted by that lady, became angry and showed his hideous form.
The wicked-minded demon spoke harsh words terrifying her. He threatened the brahmin lady in many ways.
Then the frightened brahmin lady, lovingly resorting to Siva, repeated the name Siva many times.

# Cofirudrasaihhiti

14. The agitated lady repeated the names of Siva, sought refuge in him for the protection of her sacred virtue.

15. To protect one who sought refuge in him and to uphold good conduct, Siva manifested himself, as well as to delight her.

16. Siva, favourably disposed towards his devotees, immediately reduced to ashes that lusty leading demon named Mu<jha class="<" p="">
</jha>
17. Looking at her with a compassionate look, lord Siva efficient in and mindful of protecting the devotees told her, “Mention the boon you wish to have".

18. On hearing the words of lord Siva that chaste lady the wife of the brahmin, saw the auspicious and delightful form of Siva.

19. Then bowing to Siva the beautiful supreme lord, the chaste lady of pure mind eulogised him with palms joined together and shoulders drooping down.

ftfika said:

20. O great God, lord of the gods, favourably disposed towards those who seek refuge, you are the kinsman of the distressed. You are lord Siva, protecting your devotees always.

21. My virtue has been saved by you from the Asura Mu<jha by="" killing="" that="" wicked="" person="" the="" whole="" universe="" has="" been="" saved="" you.&#x3C;="" p="">

22. O lord, grant me the greatest devotion to your feet which will never decay. This alone is the boon I ask of you. Nothing more than this.

23. O great lord, please listen to another request of mine. Please stay here permanently for the benefit of the people.

Seta said:

24. After eulogising lord Siva thus, R?ika of auspicious rites remained silent. Then the merciful lord Siva spoke.

Lord Siva said:

25. O Rfiki, you are well-behaved. You are a special devotee of mine. Whatever boons you have asked for have been granted to you.

# 26.

In the meantime, coming to know of the manifestation of Siva, Viṣnu, Brahma and other gods came there with great delight.

# 27.

O brahmins, bowing down with great pleasure to Siva they all worshipped him. Joining their palms and bending down they eulogised him attentively.

# 28.

In the meantime, Ganga the celestial river, with delighted mind, praised her rites and spoke to that chaste lady Śiva.

Ganga said:

# 29.

For my sake you should make a verbal promise. You should stay with me for a day in the month of Vaiṣakha.

# 30.

On hearing the words of Ganga, the chaste lady of good rites consented with pleasure for the benefit of the world.

# 31.

For her bliss, the delighted Siva, vanished into that earthen phallic image along with her.

# 32.

Praising Siva and the brahmin lady, the delighted Brahma, Viṣnu and other gods and the celestial river Ganga returned to their abodes.

# 33.

From that day onwards this became a holy and excellent centre. Siva became famous as Nandikeśa, the destroyer of all sins.

# 34.

O brahmin, in order to wipe off her sins which she takes from others, Ganga comes here on that day every year out of her own good will.

# 35.

The man who takes bath there and worships Nandikeśa with devotion becomes freed from all sins such as the slaughter of a Brahmin etc.

# ( The greatness of Mahabala)

Sdta said:

1. O brahmins, listen with devotion to the phallic forms of Siva that exist in the western quarter on this earth.
2. In the city of Kapila 132 are the two divine phallic images of Siva named Kala and Ramesvara. By their very sight they dispel sins.
3. Mahasiddhesvara is on the shore of the western ocean and is famous as the bestower of virtue, wealth, love and salvation.
4. Gokarna 133 the excellent shrine, situated on the shore of the western ocean, destroys the sin of brahmin’s slaughter and other sins and yields the fruits of all desires.
5. At Gokarna there are crores and crores of Siva’s phallic images. At every step there are innumerable holy centres.
6. Of what avail is much talk. Everything in Gokarna is Siva’s visible phallic image. All the waters there are holy Tirthas.
7. O dear, the greatness of Siva’s holy images and the Tirthas at Gokarna is explained and described in the Puranas by great sages.
8. In the Kj*ta Yuga it is white; in the Treta it is deep-red; in the Dvapara it is yellow and in the Kali age it is dark in colour.
9. Mahabala, though it has pervaded the regions as far below as the seven nether worlds, will become soft when the terrible age of Kali arrives.
10. Persons committing great sins have attained Siva’s region after worshipping Mahabala, the phallic image of Siva at Gokarna.

132 The present text locates the town Kapila, famous for the shrines of Kftleivara and RAmeivara, in the west of Bharata.

133 The Gokarna fC?etra referred to here is located in the Western Ghat. There is a town of this name in the Kanara District with a phallic image of lord Siva there. This Gokarna should be not confused with the town of the name situated in Nepal on the B&#x26;gamatl river.

# Sivapufina

11. O sages, those who worship the lord with devotion after going to Gokarna on a holy day with sacred constellation will undoubtedly become Rudras themselves.

12. A devotee worshipping Siva’s image at any time in Gokarna attains the region of Brahma.

13. With a desire for the welfare of Brahma, Visnu and other gods, the lord is always present there in the name of Mahabala.

14. That phallic image secured by the Rak?asa Ravana as a result of severe penance was installed by Gananayaka at Gokarna.

15-16. The following deities resort to its eastern gate out of devotion for it — Visnu, Brahma, Mahendra, ViSve-devas, Marudganas, Adityas, Vasus, Dasras, the moon with the stars and the gods with their attendants. They go there in their aerial chariots.

17. Yama, the god of death himself, Citragupta, the firegod, the manes and the Rudras resort to the southern gate.

19. Similarly the wind god, Kubera, Bhadrakalika, the goddess of the gods and Canqlika and other Mothers resort to the northern gate.

20-22. All the gods, the Gandharvas, the Pitfs, Siddhas, Garanas, Vidyadharas, Kimpurusas, Kinnaras, Guhyakas, Khagas, different types of Pisacas, Vetalas, the powerful Daiteyas, Sesa and other serpents, the Siddhas and the sages, eulogise and bow to lord Mahabala.

26. On this festive day of Siva, people of all the four castes come here from all countries, desirous of witnessing the great festivals.

27. Women, old men, children and people of the four stages of life come there, see the lord of gods and obtain contentment.

28. It is by the power of Mahabala that a Cancjali attained Sivaloka after worshipping that image of Siva.

# CHAPTER NINE

# (The attainment of good goal by the outcaste woman)

The sages said:

1. O Suta, O fortunate Suta, you are blessed, you are the most excellent among the devotees of Siva. O holy lord, please narrate the story of the outcaste woman you just referred to.

2. Suta said: O brahmins, listen with great devotion to that wonderful story illustrative of Siva’s power. It enhances the devotional feelings of the listeners.

3. The outcaste woman was a brahmin girl in her previous birth. She was named Saumini. She was endowed with all characteristic signs. Her face was bright like the moon. O brahmins, that youthful maiden Saumini was married to a certain brahmin boy duly by her father.

4. After getting a husband, O great brahmins, she in her fresh blooming youth indulged in sexual dalliance with him and maintained her auspicious rites.

5. O brahmins, then her youthful husband, the brahmin boy became distressed with a great ailment. Due to the misfortune of Saumini he died.

6. When the husband passed away, the woman was much distressed, dejected and despondent. For some time



---

she maintained her pure conduct. She remained in the house, a well-behaved lady.

# 8.

Thereafter, though a widow, her heart became defiled by lustful feelings because she was still in her prime of youth. She then transgressed the limits of decency.

# 9.

Coming to know of her misdeeds defiling the family her kinsmen gathered together, caught hold of her hair, took her far off and abandoned her.

# 10.

A leading Sudra saw her roaming about in the forest, took her to his house and made her his wife.

# 11.

She then became very fond of sexual intercourse, began to take in meat and indulged in drinking wine. She bore that Sudra a daughter too.

# 12.

Once while the husband had gone somewhere, Saumini the erring woman drank wine and badly wanted meat.

# 13.

In her cattleshed outside, goats and sheep had been tethered along with cows. It was dusk when nothing could be visible due to darkness. She then took a sword and went out.

# 14.

Inebriated that she was, the foul woman fond of flesh diet killed a calf taking it to be a goat without much consideration.

# 15.

After taking it within she realised that it was a calf. The terrified woman blurted out “Siva, Siva”, thanks to some previous merit.

# 16.

She meditated on Siva for a short while. But the desire for meat overwhelmed her. She minced the meat of the calf and ate it up with great relish.

# 17.

O brahmins, when a long time elapsed thus, Saumini died and went to Yama's abode.

# 18.

Yama went through her antecedents and taking into consideration her merits and demerits he sent her back from hell to be born in an outcaste family.

# 19.

Fallen from Yama’s city she was born as a congenitally blind girl out of the womb of a Cancjala woman. Her complexion was as dark as the dying embers.

# 20.

She was born blind. Even during her infancy her father and mother died. She was not married to anyone.

KofirudrasathhUd
She became infected with leprosy and was utterly defiled.

1. Emaciated and distressed with hunger, blind and moving about with a staff in her hand, she somehow subdued her gastric fire by the leavings of food of the Gandalas nearby.
2. With great difficulty and sufferings she passed a major portion of her life. When old age affected her limbs she was subjected to unending grief and distress.
3. Once she came to know of travellers going to visit Mahabala and Gokarna on the Siva festival day.
4. Then prompted by a desire for clothes and meals she walked slowly to beg of the general public.
5. She moved about here and there begging of the people imploring them with piteous words and outstretched hands after arriving at that place.
6. In the outstretched hands of the suppliant woman, a meritorious traveller hurled a bunch of Bilva leaves.
7. When that bunch fell into her hands she felt it again and again and realising that it was not edible she cast it off dejectedly.
8. That bunch of Bilva leaves cast off from her hands during the night, fortunately fell on the top of a Siva’s phallic image.
9. Thus on the Siva CaturdaSi night though she begged of the travellers again and again she did not get anything through the intercession of fate.
10. Thus, unwittingly she observed the rites of Sivacaturda£i and kept awake during the night and obtained great bliss.
11. Then in the next morning, overcome with great grief the dejected woman returned to her native place alone slowly.
12. Exhausted by long starvation, and faltering and staggering at every step she somehow covered the long distance but fell down unconscious.
13. Seated in an aerial chariot brought immediately by Siva’s Ganas, thanks to Siva’s mercy, she went to Siva’s region.



---


34. O brahmins, since at the outset the unchaste woman had cried out Siva’s name unwittingly, she acquired a great merit whereby she reached the divine abode of Mahabala.

35. At Gokarna on Siva’s Tithi during the night she had kept awake and observed fast. She had performed the worship of Siva’s image with Bilva bunch.

36. That was the fruit of a meritorious action performed unconsciously. She was liberated thanks to the grace of Mahabala.

37. Thus is the great image of Mahabala, destructive of sins and the bestower of the highest bliss instantaneously.

38. O brahmins thus the greatness of the excellent Siva image Mahabala has been mentioned to you by me.

39. I shall now mention another wonderful glory of the same. By merely listening to it, the devotion for Siva is generated.

# CHAPTER TEN

# (The greatness and glory of Mahabala)

SUta said:

1. There was a highly virtuous king Mitrasaha in the glorious family of Iksvaku. He was the greatest of skilled archers.

2. The virtuous and auspicious-natured lady Madayanti was his beloved wife, like Damayanti of Nala. She was known as a chaste lady.

3. Fond of hunting, once that king Mitrasaha went to a thick forest accompanied by a huge army.

4. Sporting about there, the king killed a wicked demon Kamatha who used to harass good men.

5. The demon’s younger brother, a deceitful sinner thought “I shall conquer him by deceitful means” and with this evil intention approached the king.

6. On seeing him humble in behaviour in seeking

service under him, the king made him the chief cook without knowing his real nature.

7. After indulging in hunting sports for sometime in the forest, the king abandoned the game and joyously returned to his capital.

8. On the Sraddha day of his father the king invited his preceptor Vasistha to his palace and fed him devoutly.

9. On seeing the vegetarian and non-vegetarian dish in which the demon in the guise of a cook had mixed human flesh, the preceptor said.

The preceptor said:

10. O wicked king, fie upon you. Human flesh has been deceitfully offered to me by you. Hence you will become a demon.

11. On realising that it had been perpetrated by the demon, the preceptor pondered over and prescribed a time-limit of twelve years for the curse.

12. Thinking that the curse was unjustified, the infuriated king was about to return the curse with a handful of water.

13. Then the chaste and virtuous queen Madayanti fell at his feet and entreated him to spare the curse.

14. Out of deference for her entreaties the king desisted from cursing, but dropped the handful of water on his own feet which became deformed.

15. O great sages, from that day onwards the king became famous in the world as Kalmasanghri by the virtue of that water.

16. By the curse of his preceptor the leading sage, the king Mitrasaha became a terrible violent Raksasa, roaming in the forest.

17. Transformed as Raksasa and resembling Yama, the destroyer of the world, he roamed about in the forest devouring various living beings, men and others.

18. Once, somewhere in the forest, the king who was as hideous as the god of death saw a newly married couple — a young sage and his young wife indulging in sexual dalliance.

Siuapur&#x26;na
19. The demon habituated to eat human flesh in his distressed state due to the curse caught hold of the young sage in order to eat him like a tiger seizing a fawn!

20. The young woman, on seeing her husband seized by the demon, was much frightened and implored him with piteous cries.

21. In spite of repeated importunities the man-eating ruthless wicked demon cut off the head of the brahmin sage and devoured it.

22. The distressed, grief-stricken chaste lady lamented much. She gathered the bones of her husband and lighted a funeral pyre.

23. The brahmin lady desirous of entering the pyre in order to follow her husband cursed the Rak?asa king.

24. The chaste lady entered fire after proclaiming “From now onwards if you become united with any woman in sexual embrace you will die.”

25. After undergoing the results of his preceptor’s curse to which there was a time-limit, the king regained his original form and joyously returned to his palace.

26. Madayanti who knew of the curse of the chaste brahmin lady prevented her husband who evinced a desire for sexual embrace. She was much frightened of widowhood.

27. The issueless king became disgusted with kingly pleasures. Eschewing all riches he went to the forest.

28. He saw the hideous form of Brahmahatya closely following him, threatening him again and again and tormenting him.

29. Dejected in mind the king wanted to get rid of Brahmahatya. He tried japas, holy rites, sacrifices and various other means.

30. O brahmins, when Brahmahatya did not leave him inspite of the means like the ceremonial ablution in holy centres, the king went to Mithila.

31. Distressed and worried by anxiety the king reached a park at the outskirts of the city. There he saw the sage Gautama approaching him.

32. The king advanced towards that sage of pure

mind. He felt satiated on seeing him. He bowed to him again and again.

# 33.

When the sage enquired of his welfare, the king heaved a sigh of grief and distress. Viewed mercifully by him the king felt pleased and contented. He said thus. The king said:

# 34.

O dear, it is imperceptible to others but it threatens me at every step.

# 35.

A brahmin boy had been devoured by me in the clutches of a curse. That sin cannot be suppressed even by thousands of expiatory rites.

# 36.

O sage, I roamed here and there and tried various means to quell it. But it did not leave me off. Is it not due to my being a sinning soul?

# 37.

Now it seems to me that I have attained the fruits of my birth because merely by your sight my heart is filled with bliss.

# 38.

O fortunate one, I, the sinner, seek refuge in your lotus-like feet. Grant me peace, whereby I can be happy.

Sdta said:

# 39.

Implored thus by the king, the kind-hearted Gautama instructed him in the expiatory means for terrible sins. Gautama said:

# 40.

O excellent king, well done. You are blessed. Eschew all fear from sins. As long as Siva is the ruler, there can be no terror to devotees who seek refuge in him.

# 41.

O fortunate king, listen. There is another shrine well consecrated. There is a Siva’s temple named Gokarna. It destroys all great sins.

# 42.

Sins greater than the greatest cannot stay there. Siva himself is present there in the name of Mahabala.

# 43.

Mahabala is the emperor of all phallic images. It assumes four different colours in the four Yugas. It dispels all sins.

44. The excellent holy centre of Gokarna is on the shore of western ocean. There is a phallic image of Siva, destructive of great sins.

45. Great sinners go there, take their ceremonial ablutions many times in the sacred waters and worship Mahabala. They have all attained Siva’s region.

46. King, you also go to Gokarna, the temple of Siva. After going there and worshipping Siva attain contentment.

47. Take your holy dip in the sacred waters there. Worship Mahabala. Thus you will be rid of sins and attain Sivaloka.

SQta said:

48. Advised thus by the noble-souled Gautama, the king highly delighted in the mind reached Gokarna.

49. He took his dip in the holy ponds and worshipped Mahabala. His sins were wiped off without the least vestige. He attained the great region of Siva.

50. He who listens to this pleasing narrative of Mahabala goes to Siyaloka along with the members of his family upto twenty-one generations.

51. Thus the extremely wonderful glory of Mahabala, the phallic image of Siva, has been narrated to you. It dispels all sins.

SUta said:

# 3.

O brahmins, listen with respect. I shall succinctly explain the particular glory of the northern phallic images of Siva.

# 4.

There is another shrine Gokarna destructive of great sins. There is an extensive holy forest there.

# 5.

The moon-crested Siva’s phallic image, excellent of all, is situated there. It was installed by Ravana with great devotion and it confers all accomplishments.

# 6.

O great sages, its situation there, is for the benefit of the people as that of Vaidy~»natha, the ocean of mercy.

# 7.

Taking the ceremonial ablution in Gokarna and worshipping the moon-crested Siva, the devotee attains Sivaloka. True. It is true undoubtedly.

# 8.

It is impossible to describe in detail the excessively wonderful glory of the moon-crested lord Siva who has a great affection for his devotees.

# 9.

Somehow the extreme grandeur of the phallic Siva has been explained to you. Now listen to that of the other phallic image.

# 10.

In the excellent holy centre 134 of the sage MiSra, the phallic image of Siva had been installed by the great sage Dadhlci.

# 11.

After going there and taking the due ceremonial ablution in the sacred pond, the devotee shall worship this image reverentially.

# 12.

The idol of DadhTca should be duly worshipped for the propitiation of Siva by those who seek the fruit of the pilgrimage. O excellent sages, this duly performed, the

devotee will feel contented. After enjoying all pleasure here he will attain the supreme goal hereafter.

# 14.

The phallic image of Siva known as Rslsvara installed by the sages in the holy centre of Naimisa 135 forest, yields happiness.

16. The phallic image destructive of sins, in the holy centre of Hatyaharana should be particularly worshipped. It destroys even the sins of several slaughters.

17. Lalitesvara, the phallic image of Siva in the holy centre Devaprayaga should be worshipped by men. It is destructive of all sins.

18. The phallic image Pasupatisa in the Nayapala town famous on the earth is the bestower of the fruits of all desires.

19. That phallic image is in the form of the crest. I shall narrate the story in the description of Kedaresvara.

20. Close to it lies the wonderful phallic image Mukti-natha. Its very sight and worship bestows worldly enjoyment here and liberation hereafter.

21. O great sages, the excellent phallic images in the four quarters have been thus described to you all. What else do you wish to hear.

# CHAPTER TWELVE

(The reason for Siva's assuming the phallic form)

The sages said:

1. O Suta, you know everything by the grace of Vyasa. There is nothing not known to you. Hence we approach you with a query.

2. The phallic form of Siva is worshipped throughout the world. You have said so. Is there any special reason for the same?

3. Parvati, the beloved of Siva, is heard in the world in the form of an arrow. O Suta, what is the reason for this? Please satisfy our curiosity in this respect by giving the account you have heard.

# 4.

O brahmins, the story of a different Kalpa was heard from Vyasa by me. O excellent sages, I shall narrate the same. Please listen.

# 5.

What happened formerly among the brahmins in the Daruvana¹³⁸ forest may kindly be heard. I shall narrate the same in the manner I have heard.

# 6.

There is an excellent forest Daruvana. There were many excellent sages there, great devotees of Siva who were always engrossed in meditation on Siva.

# 7.

O great sages, they performed the worship of Siva incessantly thrice a day. They eulogised Siva with different devotional hymns.

# 8.

Once the leading brahmin devotees of Siva engrossed in the meditation of Siva went into the forest for bringing sacrificial twigs.

# 9.

In the meantime Siva himself assuming a very hideous form came there in order to test their devotion.

# 10.

He was very brilliant but stark naked. He had smeared ashes all over his body as the sole ornament. Standing there and holding his penis he began to show all sorts of vicious tricks.

# 11.

It was with a mind to do something pleasing to the forest-dwellers that Siva, favourite of the devotees, came to the forest at his will.

# 12.

The wives of the sages were extremely frightened at this sight. The other women excited and surprised approached the lord.

# 13.

Some embraced him. Others held his hands. The women were engrossed in struggling with one another.

# 14.

Meanwhile the great sages came there. On seeing him engaged in perverse activities they were pained and infuriated.

# 15.

The deluded sages, plunged in grief, began to say — “Who is this?”

# 16.

When the naked sage did not reply, the great sages told that terrible Purusa.

17. “You are acting pervertedly. This violates the Vedic path. Hence let your penis fall on the ground.”

Suta said:

18. When they said thus, the penis of that Avadhuta, who was Siva of wonderful form, fell down instantly.

19. That penis burnt everything in front; wherever it went it began to burn everything there.

20. It went to Patala; it went to heaven; it went all over the earth; it never remained steady anywhere.

21. All the worlds and the people were distressed. The sages became grief-stricken. Whether gods or sages no one had any peace or joy.

22. All the gods and sages who did not recognize Siva became sad. They assembled together and hastened to Brahma and sought refuge in him.

23. O brahmins, after going there, they bowed to and eulogised Brahma. They narrated what had happened to Brahma the Creator.

24. Brahma heard them. He realised that they had been deluded by Siva’s Maya. After bowing to Siva, he told the excellent sages.

Brahma said:

25. O brahmins, you though wise do such despicable things. Then why complain against the ignorant who act likewise?

26-27. Who can wish for happiness after offending and antagonising Siva thus? If a person does not welcome and serve a guest at midday, his virtue is taken away by the guest who in return deposits his sin in him. What then of Siva himself as a guest?

28. As long as the penis does not become stationary there cannot be anything good in the three worlds. I am telling you the truth.

29. O sages, you must do such things as will make the penis of Siva steady. Please ponder over this in your minds.

When the great sages asked him thus, Brahma, the grandfather of the worlds, spoke to them.

# Brahma said:

Let the gods propitiate goddess Parvati and pray. If she can assume the form of the vaginal passage that penis will become steady.

O excellent sages, listen. I shall tell you the mode of procedure. Act accordingly with love and devotion. She will be thus pleased.

Make an eight-petalled mystic diagram of lotus and place a pot over it. Water from holy centres shall be poured into the pot along with the sprouts of Durva and barley.

The pot shall be invoked with Vedic mantras. It shall be worshipped according to the Vedic rituals after remembering Siva.

The penis shall be drenched with that water, great sages. When the sprinkling is made with Satarudriya mantras it will become stable.

Parvati in the form of the Vaginal passage and an auspicious arrow shall form as the pedestal wherein the phallus shall be installed in accompaniment of the Vedic mantras.

Lord Siva shall be propitiated with the offerings of sweet scents, sandal paste, fragrant flowers, incense and other things as well as by food offerings and other forms of worship.

With prostrations, holy hymns, musical instruments and songs he shall be propitiated further. Svastyayana mantras shall be repeated and the devotees shall proclaim the victory of the lord.

The following prayer shall be recited lord of the:

41. You are the beginning of the universe, the origin of the universe within the universe. “O lord Siva, be quiet. Protect all the worlds.”

42. If this is performed there will be stability, to be sure. There will not be any aberration in the three worlds. There will be happiness always.

Suta said: —

43. O brahmins, thus advised, the gods bowed to Brahma and then sought refuge in Siva with a desire for the happiness of the worlds.

44. When worshipped with great devotion and implored, lord Siva became delighted and spoke to them.

Lord Siva said:

48. After propitiating Parvati and the bull-bannered lord and performing the rites mentioned before, the excellent penis became static.

49. The gods and the sages propitiated Parvati and Siva by the mode of procedure laid down in the Vedas for the sake of virtue.

50. Brahma, Visnu and other gods, sages and the three worlds including the mobile and immobile beings worshipped Siva particularly.

51. Siva became delighted and so also Parvati, the mother of the universe. That phallus was held by her in that form then.

52. When the phallus was stabilised, there was wel-

53. The phallus is known as “HateSa” as well as “Sivi-Siva.” By worshipping it, all the people become happy in every respect.

54. Here everything will flourish in plenty conferring supreme happiness and bliss. Hereafter it will bestow final liberation. No doubt need be entertained in this respect.

# CHAPTER THIRTEEN

# (The origin of Va(uka)

Suta said:

1. O brahmins, it has been narrated to you how Siva came to be worshipped in the three worlds in the form of a phallic image. What else do you wish to hear?

The sages said:

2. O holy lord, please narrate the glory of the phallic image known as Andhake£vara. Similarly it behoves you to mention the glory of other phallic images willingly.

Suta said:

3. Formerly the Asura Andhaka resorted to the deep ditch of the ocean and kept the three worlds under his control. He harrassed the gods.

4. He used to come out of the ditch and harrass the people. Then he of great exploit re-entered the ditch.

5. O great sages, the gods were grief-stricken. Imploring Siva again and again, they mentioned their miseries to him.

Suta said:

6. On hearing the words of the gods, the delighted lord Siva, the slayer of the wicked and the goal of the good replied.



---


# Sivapurana

Siva said:

1. I shall slay that Asura Andhaka, the murderer of the gods. O gods, proceed with the army. I too shall come along with the Ganas.
2. When that terrible antagonist of the gods and the sages came out of the ditch, the gods went and occupied it.
3. The Asuras and the gods fought a terrible battle. By the blessings of Siva, the gods became very strong.
4. Attacked and tormented by the gods, the Asura returned to the ditch when he was pierced through with the trident by Siva, the supreme soul.
5. Remaining there he meditated on Siva and prayed “On seeing you at the hour of death, one becomes identical with you instantaneously.”
6. Thus eulogised, the delighted Siva spoke to him “Mention the boon you wish to have. I shall grant it to you.”
7. On hearing these words, the Asura said again after bowing to and eulogising Siva with pious feelings. Andhaka said:
8. O lord of gods, if you are delighted grant me the auspicious devotion to you. Taking unusual compassion on me, be stationed here.

Stita said:

Requested thus, Siva hurled that Asura into that ditch. He himself stood there in the form of a phallic image with a desire to help the world.
If a man worships Andhake£a every day, his desires are fulfilled within six months.
The brahmin who worships the beneficent phallic image for his livelihood for six months becomes a Devalaka, the worshipper of idol for subsistence. He is not authorised in ordinary rites of brahmins.

The sages said: O Who is a Devalaka? What is his function? intelligent one, mention that for the guidance of the people.

# Suta said:

20. There was a brahmin Dadhici who was well-versed in the Vedas and highly virtuous. He was engrossed in his devotion to Siva and was interested in Siva’s lore.

21. His son was known as Sudarsana whose wife was Dukula. She was born of a defiled family.

22. The husband was always under her control. He had four sons. Of course he used to worship Siva every day.

23. Then it happened that Dadhici had to go and live in another village along with his kinsmen. The kinsmen did not let him go back.

24. While leaving home, Dadhici, the excellent devotee, had already instructed his son, “Be devoted to Siva.”

25. Sudarsana’s son also worshipped Siva. Great sages, thus a long time elapsed.

26-28. So, once it happened that on a Sivaratri occasion when all observed fast, Sudarsana had his sexual intercourse with his wife and then performed the worship. But before he performed the worship he abstained from taking bath. For this misdeed Siva was infuriated and said.

Lord Siva said —

29. O knave, you had sexual intercourse with your wife on the occasion of Sivaratri. Without taking bath you performed the worship. You are an indiscreet fellow.

30. Because you have done this consciously, be sluggish and insensible. You are an untouchable person for me. Avoid touching me.

Suta said:

31. Cursed thus by lord Siva, Sudarsana, the son of Dadhici, attained insensibility immediately, deluded by Siva’s Maya. O brahmins, meanwhile Dadhici, the excellent devotee of Siva, returned from the other village and heard the details.

32. He was rebuked by Hence he much.

33. He felt distressed. “Oh am I doomed by this foul deed of my son.”

34. Dadhici, honoured amongst the good, grumbled.

1304 Sivapw&#x26;na again and again — “My excellent family is damned by the misbehaviour of my vicious son.

35. That son too is doomed. He has taken at vicious slut to his wife.” Thus the son was rebuked by his father who repented.

36. The father then worshipped Parvati with excellent rites, sincere devotion and perseverance for the happiness of his son.

37. Sudar£ana himself performed the worship of Parvati with great devotion adopting the path of Can&#x3C;)i worship and with auspicious hymns.

38. Thus by various means and with sincere devotion the father and the son propitiated the goddess Parvati who is favourably disposed towards her devotees.

39. O sage, by the devotion of their service Candika was delighted. She adopted Sudarsana as her son.

40. For the sake of her adopted son she herself implored Siva. Siva who was angry had become quite calm. The son also was delighted.

41. Then realising that lord Siva the bull-bannered deity was delighted, she bowed to him herself and placed the son on his lap.

42-43. Making the ablution of the son with ghee, P&#x26;rvati handed over to her son SudarSana the three-stringed sacred thread with a single knot and imparted instruction in Sivagayatri 14&#x3C;> consisting of sixteen syllables.

44. Then the brahmin boy performed the Samkalpapuja (worship by mental conception) sixteen times with the five-syllabled mantra with the word Sri prefixed to Siva.

45-46. Beginning with ceremonial ablution and ending with the concluding obeisance he worshipped the bull-bannered deity by means of devotional mantras, musical instruments and adorations in the presence of the sages. He recited various names of Siva. Then the delighted Siva and

Candika said.

1. “Wealth, foodgrain etc. whatever is offered to me shall be taken by you. There is no sin in this action.
2. In the rites concerning me you will officiate as the chief, especially so in the rites concerning the goddess. Ghee, oil etc., everything offered to me shall be taken by you.
3. When the Prajapatya rite is performed only one of you shall be there. Then alone is the worship complete. Or everything becomes fruitless.
4. The Tilaka must be made round. Then you shall take bath. Sandhya prayers to Siva shall be offered and his Gayatri repeated.
5. After rendering service to me at the outset, the other rites shall be performed according to the family tradition. When everything is thus performed there shall be welfare. Your blemishes have been excused by me.

Suta said:

After saying this, the supreme soul Siva consecrated his four sons as Vatukas in the four quarters.
After keeping Sudarsana as her son with herself she granted boons to his sons and blessed them in several ways.

The Goddess said:

Between you two whoever becomes my Vatuka shall be victorious. No doubt need be entertained in this respect.
He who worships you has worshipped me too. You shall perform your duties always, O son.

Suta said:

Thus boons were granted to the noble Sudarsana and his sons by Siva and Siva out of pity for the welfare of the worlds.
Because they had been established by Siva and Siva they are known as Vatukas. Those who neglect penance are known as Tapodhamas.
Thanks to the mercy of Siva and Siva they

expanded in various ways. Their worship at the outset is the great worship of Siva, the supreme soul.

59. No worship shall be performed by any person as long as he has not performed Siva’s worship. If it is performed it does not turn out to be auspicious.

60. Whether auspicious or inauspicious, the Vatuka is not to be eschewed. In the Prajapatya rite and at the feast a single Va{u is considered excellent.

61. O intelligent one, hear the same. O faultless one, I shall explain it now.

62-63. I shall explain in the manner I have heard, the event that happened in the city of king Bhadra near the shrine of Andhake€a during the daily rite of feasting in the PrajapatyaA rite. A banner was given to that king by Siva who was satisfied with his devotion. The king was addressed too by the lord mercifully.

64. The banner will be raised and bound in the morning. It will fall down in the night. This will happen when the Prajapatya rite is full and complete. Otherwise this banner will remain steady even during the night. After saying this to the king, the delighted Siva, the storehouse of mercy, vanished. O great sage, the king adopted the procedure accordingly.

67. The Prajapatya rite was performed every day in accordance with the rules of Siva-worship.

68. If the rites became full and complete, the banner rose up itself in the morning and fell down during the night.

69. On one occasion the function of the Vatu took place in the beginning. The banner then fell even before the feast.

70. On seeing it there, the learned men were asked by the king. The brahmins are at their feast. Why is the banner not flying?

71. How did it fall down? Brahmins, tell me the truth. Thus asked the brahmins, the excellent scholars, said.

72. O great king, while feasting the brahmins

Kofirudrasarhhitd 1307

Vatuka the son of Can&#x3C;}i was fed at the outset. Siva was satisfied. Hence the banner fell down.

73. On hearing it, the king and the people were surprised. They praised them.

74. Thus the greatness of the Vatukas was enhanced by Siva. The Vatukas are glorified as excellent ritualists by those who know things of yore.

75. At first Siva’s worship shall be performed by the Batukas alone. Not otherwise. None else is entitled to the worship as Siva has said.

76. They shall conclude the worship with the remarks, “Let the worship be complete.” This alone is their work. Nothing else.

77. O great sages, thus whatever was asked has been narrated to you, on hearing which a man obtains the fruit of Siva’s worship.

# CHAPTER FOURTEEN

# (The origin of the Jyotirlinga Somandtha)

The sages said:

1. Please narrate the greatness of the Jyotirlingas. Please mention their origin and everything else in the manner you have heard.

S&#x26;ta said:

2. O brahmins, please listen, I shall narrate its greatness and origin succinctly in the manner I have heard from my good preceptor, to the extent of my intellect.

3. The first among them is glorified as Somanatha. O sage, at the outset, listen to its greatness with attention.

4. O great sages, the greatness of Jyotirlingas cannot be adequately described even in hundreds of years. Still I shall tell you.

5. O great sages, his daughters, twenty-seven in number, A£vini and others, were given in marriage to the moon by Dak$a, the great soul.

# Sivapurdna

6. On securing the moon as their lord, those daughters shone extraordinarily. The moon too, on securing them shone incessantly.

7. The jewel shines with gold and the gold shines with the jewel. Now listen to what happened in due course.

8. Out of his twenty-seven wives he did not love any one so much at anytime as he loved Rohini.

9. The others became distressed and sought refuge in their father. After going to him they mentioned their misery to him.

10. On hearing it, Daksa too was struck with grief. Brahmins, approaching the moon he calmly spoke to him thus.

11. Dak$a said: O storehouse of digits, you are born of a noble family. How can you cherish oddity in your affection towards your dependents?

12. If you have done so, stop with it. This is enough. You shall not repeat it. Oddity in behaviour is said to be conducive to hell.

13. After requesting the moon, his son-in-law, thus, Dak?a returned to his abode fully assured.

14. The moon did not act according to his advice being deluded by Siva’s Maya which deludes the universe.

15. Welfare befalls him who is destined to have it. How can one destined to court woe have a weal?

16. Being subjected to the force of destiny the moon did not accept his advice. Infatuated of Rohini he neglected others.

17. On hearing it the skilful Dak?a returned to the moon excessively distressed. He politely asked the moon to mend his ways.

18. Daksa said: O moon, although requested repeatedly, you did not pay heed to my entreaties. Hence, fall a prey to the wasting disease.

Kofirudrasarfikitd 1309

SUta said :

# 19.

Just as he cursed him, the moon contracted consumption within a trice. When he was wasted away there was a great hue and cry.

# 20.

O sage, the gods and the sages became extremely agitated and felt miserable — “What shall be done? What will happen now?”

# 21.

Informed and implored by the moon, Indra and other gods, Vasistha and other sages sought refuge in Brahma. O sage, after in their great agitation they bowed to and eulogised Brahma and mentioned everything to him.

# 22.

On hearing their words Brahma was much surprised. Praising the Maya of Siva within their hearing he said.

# Brahma said :

# 24.

O what a pity? This is distressing to the entire world. The moon is always wicked and defiled. Now Dak§a has cursed him.

# 25.

Many unholy deeds have been committed by the wicked moon. O sages, O gods, may the early misdeeds of the moon be heard.

# 26.

The wicked fellow went to Brhaspati’s house and abducted his wife Tara. He then allied himself with the Daityas.

# 27.

Having sought refuge in the Daityas he fought against the god though forbidden by me and Atri. Then the moon restored Tara to Bfhaspati.

# 28.

Seeing her pregnant, Brhaspati refused to take her back. Induced by us he accepted her unwillingly.

# 29-30.

But he said, “If she casts off the foetus I shall accept her.” When they asked her whose child she bore in the womb, she replied that the foetus grew out of the seed of the moon. O excellent sages, I then removed the foetus and urged by me, she was accepted by him.

# 31.

What avails the narration of his previous countless vicious deeds? He still continues to do similar things.



---


# 32.

What has happened cannot be reversed. I shall tell you the means to be adopted now. Listen attentively.

# 33.

Let the moon go to the auspicious shrine at Prabhasa along with the gods. Let him propitiate Siva there according to Mrtyufijaya rites.

# 34.

Let him perform the penance incessantly sitting before the lord. The delighted Siva will cure him from consumption afterwards.

# Suta said:

# 35.

On hearing the words of Brahma, the gods and sages returned to the place where Daksa and the moon were present.

# 36-37.

The gods and the sages consoled Daksa and took the moon to Prabhasa. They invoked the sacred waters of SaiasvatT and other rivers and performed the worship of the earthen phallic image in accordance with the Mrtyufijaya rites.

# 38.

The gods and the sages of pious mind left the moon at Prabhasa and joyously returned to their abodes.

# 39.

The moon performed the penance incessantly for six months. He worshipped the bull-bannered deity with the Mrtyufijaya mantra.

# 40.

The moon repeated the Mrtyufijaya¹⁴² mantra a hundred million times. He meditated on the lord Mrtyufijaya with his mind unruffled.

# 41.

Lord Siva, who is favourably disposed towards his devotees, was pleased by his devotion and manifesting himself there spoke to him thus.

# Siva said:

O moon, may there be welfare to you. Choose your boon, whatever you desire in your mind. I am pleased with you. I shall grant you an excellent boon.

The moon said: O lord of gods, if you are delighted, what is not

44. Pardon my faults. Always benevolent to.

When he had said thus Siva spoke to him again. Siva said:

45. O moon, let your digit decline day by day in one fortnight and increase steadily in another.

Suta said:

46. O brahmins, when this happened the delighted gods and the sages came there quickly.

47. After coming there they offered benedictory blessings to the moon. They joined their palms in reverence and bowed to Siva. They prayed to him devotionally. The gods said:

48. O great god, lord of gods, obeisance be to you. Siva, lord, be stable here along with Uma.

Suta said:

49. Then the moon eulogised the lord with good devotion first in the Nirguna and then in the Saguna form.

50-51. Siva was delighted with the gods. For increasing the glory and greatness of the region and the moon, Siva stayed there in the name of Somesvara. He became famous in the three worlds. O brahmins, by worship Siva becomes the destroyer of ailments such as consumption, leprosy etc. indeed and contented he in whose name.

52. Blessed is Siva the lord of the worlds, himself stayed there sanctifying the entire world.

53. A pond was established there itself by all the gods. That was shared by Siva and Brahma together.

54. It is famous as the moon’s pond on the earth. It is destructive of sins. The man who takes bath there gets rid of sins here.

55. Incurable diseases like consumption are entirely eradicated if a person takes ablutions there for six months.

56. A pious man attains the fruit of circumambulating.

37. On seeing this Somaliuga a person is relieved of all sins. After enjoying the fruits as desired, he attains heaven after death.

38. He who makes pilgrimage to this place attains the fruits of whatever he might have had in view. There is no doubt about this.

59-60. Thus seeing the fruit of that high order, the sages and the gods joyously bowed to Siva and took the moon now freed from wastage. Circumambulating and praising that holy centre they returned to their abodes. The moon resumed his former activity.

61. O great sages, thus the details of the origin of Somesa have been narrated to you. Somesvara has originated thus.

62. He who listens to this origin or narrates it to others attains all desires and becomes rid of all sins.

# CHAPTER FIFTEEN

# (The origin of the Second Mallikarjuna Jyotirlinga)

Suta said:

1. Hereafter I shall explain the origin of Mallikarjuna on hearing which the devotee becomes intelligent and rid of all sins.

2. The story of Kumara has already been mentioned by me. I shall explain it again. It is divine and destructive of all sins.

3-4. When Kumara, son of Siva and the powerful enemy of Taraka returned to Kailasa, the celestial sage Narada came there and told him all the news such as the marriage of Ganesvara and corrupted his mind.

# 5.

On hearing it, Kumara bowed to his parents and went to the mountain Kraufica₁ *¹ though forbidden by his parents.

# 6.

Due to separation from her son, Parvali was distressed. Then Siva enlightened her.

# 7.

O beloved, why are you distressed? O Parvali, do not be grieved. O beautiful lady, our son will certainly return. Let not your excessive grief overpower you.

# 8.

When the distressed Parvali did not pay heed to his advice, the celestial sages were sent to Karttika by Siva.

# 9.

The gods and the sages, accompanied by their attendants went there joyously to bring back Kumara.

# 10.

They went there and bowed to Kumara, implored him in many ways and requested him humbly and respectfully.

# 11.

Agitated by great pride Kumara did not care for the importunities of the gods and sages, intermingled with Siva’s behest.

# 12.

Then they returned again to Siva. After bowing to him and taking leave of him they returned to their abodes.

# 13.

When he did not return, goddess Parvati felt severely the pangs of separation from her son. Siva too was extremely miserable.

# 14.

Grief-stricken and distressed following the conventions of the world, out of affection they went to the place where their son was.

# 15.

Coming to know of the arrival of his parents, from the top of the mountain Kumara went thirty-six kilometres further out of disregard for their love.

# 16.

When he went further on the Kraunca hill, Siva and Parvati stayed behind assuming the fiery form.

# 17.

Out of filial affection they used to visit Kumara on the concluding day of every fortnight.

# 18.

Siva goes there on Amavasya day and Parvati on the Full Moon day.

# 19.

From that day onwards: that phallic image of Siva born of Mallikarjuna became famous in the three worlds.

I4T. It is a pail of Kailasa on which the Manasarovarn is situated.

20. He who sees that phallic image becomes rid of all sins and attains all desires. There is no doubt about it.

21. His misery disappears. He obtains supreme happiness. He never suffers from the distress of rebirth in the mother’s womb.

22. There is no doubt that he obtains flourishing wealth, foodgrains, fame, health and the fruits of cherished desires.

23. Thus the second Jyotirlinga Mallika has been narrated. It is the bestower of happiness and the welfare to the world.

# CHAPTER SIXTEEN

# (The greatness of the Jyotirlinga Mahakdla)

The sages said:

1. O Suta, you know everything by Vyasa’s favour. You are never satiated by hearing about the Jyotirlingas.

2. Hence O holy lord, be kind to us and narrate the third Jyotirlinga to us now.

Suta said:

3. O brahmins, if I remain in the company of you all, the glorious ones, I am blessed and contented. Blessed indeed is the association of saintly men.

4. Hence, considering it my good fortune, I shall narrate the sanctifying sin-destroying divine story. Please listen to this story respectfully.

5. There is a beautiful city Avanti yielding liberation to all souls. It is a favourite of Siva, highly meritorious and sanctifying.

6. An excellent brahmin engrossed in the performance of auspicious rites lived there. He studied the Vedas and performed the Vedic rites.

144. The town Avanti is identical with Ujjayinl, modem Ujjain.



---


7. The brahmin maintained sacrificial fires. He was the devotee of Siva. Everyday he worshipped the idol of Siva.

8. This brahmin Vedapriya was always interested in acquiring perfect knowledge. After securing the fruits of holy rites he attained the goal of the good.

9. O excellent sages, he had four sons like him. They were not inferior to their parents and they were ever engaged in the worship of Siva.

10. The eldest was Devapriya. The next was Priyamedhas. The third was Sukrta and the fourth was Dharma-vahin of good rites.

11. Thanks to the power of their merit, happiness increased on the earth even as the moon waxes incessantly in the bright half of the month.

12. Their good qualities too flourished delighting and pleasing all. That city was enveloped in the brahminical splendour. O excellent brahmins, the excellent event that

13. happened in the meantime be heard. I shall narrate it in the manner I have heard.

14. There was a great Asura Dusana on the Ratnamala hill. He was very powerful. He was the king of the Daityas incessantly engaged in hating virtue and virtuous rites.

15. Thanks to the grant of boons by Brahma he considered the whole universe insignificant. The gods were defeated by him and ousted from their places and positions.

16. Vedic rites and rites according to Smrtis all over the earth were smothered by that wicked fellow like rabbits by a lion.

17. Whatever Vedic rites were there in the shrines and holy centres were stopped by him. Dharma was exiled to a distant place.

18. “There is a beautiful city Avanti.” Thinking that what the Asura did, hear.

19. Accompanied by a vast army, the great Asura

# Sivapurdna

Dusana went there desiring to harm the brahmins staying in the city.

20. After reaching the place, that great knave, that hater of brahmins called four hefty Daityas to him and said these words.

The Daityas said: —

21. Why don’t the wicked brahmins do as I say? All these, engaged in Vedic rites and rituals are worthy of being punished by me.

22. O excellent Daityas, the gods and the kings in the world have been defeated by me. Why should not the brahmins be kept in my control?

23. If they wish to live happily let them abandon the rites of Siva and the rituals of the Vedas.

24. Otherwise it is doubtful that they will continue to live. I have said this truthfully. Hence, do that unhesitatingly.

Suta said: —

25. On hearing this and receiving the instruction the four Daityas besieged the four quarters of the city like the fires of dissolution.

26. On coming to know of the intent of the Daityas, the brahmins were not at all distressed because they were engaged in meditating on Siva.

27. Resorting to courage, the brahmins did not move even a line’s breadth from meditation. With Siva to help who can remain in distress?

28. In the meantime, the whole of that auspicious city was overrun by them. The people were harassed and they rushed against the brahmins.

The people said:

29. O holy lords, what shall be done? The wicked Asuras have come. People are tortured. They have come very near.

Suta said: —

30. On hearing their words, the brahmins, the sons of



---


# Kofirudrasarhhtti

Vedapriya, placing their faith in Siva for ever, spoke to them.

The Brahmins said:

1. Listen, we do not have an army to frighten the wicked Asuras. We do not have weapons to drive them back.
2. The general dishonour and insult reflects on him who supports us. Moreover, what can happen to Siva who is omnipotent?
3. Let lord Siva protect us from the terror of the Asuras. Except Siva, favourably disposed to his devotees there is no other refuge.

Suta said:

Emboldened thus they performed the worship of Siva’s earthen idol. They sat firmly engaged in meditation. On seeing them thus the mighty Dusana shouted “Let them be killed. Let them be bound.” But the brahmins, the sons of Vedapriya engrossed in meditation on Siva did not hear the shouts.
When the wicked Daitya desired to kill the brahmins, the spot near the Parthiva idol caved in with a loud report.
From the chasm thus created, Siva rose up assuming a hideous form. He became famous as Mahakala, the slayer of the wicked and the goal of the good.
“I am Mahakala (the great god of death) risen up against the wicked like you. O sinful one, go away, leave the presence of these brahmins.”
After saying this Siva reduced Dusana and his army, to ashes immediately with a mere sound of Hum.
Dusana and a portion of his army too were killed by Siva the great soul. A part of the army fled.
Just as darkness is dispelled on seeing the sun, so also that army was destroyed on seeing Siva.
Divine drums were sounded. Shower of flowers fell. Vijini, Brahma and other gods came there.
After bowing to the benefactor of the worlds, the

Sioapurihta brahmins joined their palms in reverence and eulogised him with different hymns.

44. After consoling the brahmins the delighted Siva asked the Brahmins to choose the boon they wished to have.

45. On hearing it, the devout brahmins with palms joined in reverence and heads bent down bowed to Siva and said.

The brahmins said:

46. O lord, the chastiser of the wicked, O Siva, grant us liberation from the ocean of worldly existence. O Siva.

47. O Siva, you shall stay here itself for the protection of the people. O lord Siva, save those who see you.

Siva said:

48. Requested thus, Siva remained in that auspicious chasm for the protection of his devotees after granting them the goal of the good.

49. The brahmins attained salvation. The supporting base of Siva in the form of Linga extended to 3 kilometres in each of the four directions.

50. O brahmins, Siva became famous as Mahakalesvara. On seeing this image no one will have misery even in dreams.

51. A man worshipping this image with a cherished desire in his mind will attain the same here and salvation hereafter. O great ones with good.

52. The origin and the greatness of Mahakala has thus been narrated to you. What else do you wish to hear?

# CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

# (The greatness of Jyotirlinga Mahakala)

The sages said:

1. O most intelligent one, please mention again the greatness of the Jyotirlinga Mahakala, the protector of his devotees.

Suta said:

O brahmins, listen with interest to the devotion enhancing greatness of Mahakala, the protector of the devotees.
In Ujjayini there was a king Candrasena, a devotee of Siva, who had conquered his sense-organs and who knew the principles of all Sastras.
O brahmins, the Gana Manibhadra, honoured by the people, the chief of the Ganas of Siva, was a friend of that king.
Once the liberal-minded Gana-chief Manibhadra, gave him the great jewel Cintamani, out of pleasure.
The jewel was as brilliant as the sun. It shone like Kaustubha. It blessed auspiciously when meditated upon, heard of or sighted.
Any thing made of bell-metal, copper, tin or stone touched with its brilliant surface turned into gold.
Wearing that gem round his neck the king Candrasena, dependent on Siva shone well like the sun in the midst of gods.
On hearing that the excellent king Candrasena had the Cintamani round his neck, the kings on the earth were agitated in their hearts due to greed.
The kings ignorantly trying to rival with him, begged of Candrasena, that jewel secured from the god. They used various means to get the jewel.
O brahmins, the importunity of the kings was rendered futile by Candrasena, a staunch devotee of Siva.
Disappointed and offended thus by him the kings of all the lands became wrathful against him.
Then the kings fully equipped with the four

Siuapur&#x26;na

Types of armies14 attempted to conquer Candrasena in the battle.

14. They joined together, consulted and conspired with one another. With a vast army they laid siege to the four main gates of Ujjayinl.

15. On seeing his city thus attacked by the kings, the king Candrasena sought refuge in Mahakalesvara.

16. Without doubts and hesitations, without taking in any food that king of steady resolve worshipped Mahakala day and night without turning his mind to anything else.

17. Then the lord Siva, delighted in his mind, concocted a means in order to save him. Listen to that with attention. O brahmins, at that very time a certain cowherdess roaming here and there in that excellent city accompanied by her child came near Mahakala.

18. She had lost her husband. She carried her babe five years old. With great devotion she watched the Mahakala worship performed by the monarch.

19. After witnessing the wonderful Siva-worship performed by him and bowing down she returned to her camp.

20. The son of that cowherdess who had watched everything out of curiosity, thought of performing Siva’s worship similarly.

21-23. He brought a fine pebble from somewhere and considered it his Sivalinga. He placed it in a vacant place not far from his camp. Various articles were conceived by him as sweet scents, ornaments, cloth, incense, lamp, rice grains and foodgrains in the course of his worship.

24. Worshipping again and again with delightful leaves and flowers he danced in various ways and made obeisance again and again.

25. As his mind was engrossed in the worship of Siva the cowherdess, his mother called him to take his meals.

26. When the son engrossed in the worship did not like to take meals though called many times, the mother went there.

14f. A complete army consists of elephants, chariots, cavalry and infantry.

27. On seeing him seated in front of Siva with eyes closed she angrily caught hold of his hand, dragged him and beat him.

28. When the son did not come away even after being dragged and struck she threw the image far off and spoiled his worship.

29. Rebuking her son who was lamenting piteously the infuriated cowherdess entered her house again.

30. On seeing his worship spoilt by his mother, the boy fell down and lamented, “O lord, lord.”

31. In his excessive grief he became unconscious suddenly. Regaining consciousness after a while he opened his eyes.

32. Immediately the camp became a beautiful temple of Mahakala. Thanks to the blessings of Siva, that child saw all these.

33. The doorway was made of gold. There were excellent festoons at the doorstep. The temple had a shining dais set with costly and pure blue diamonds.

34. The temple was equipped with many golden pot-like domes, shining jewel-bedecked columns and the floor paved with crystal bricks.

35. In the midst, the cowherd’s son saw a jewel-bedecked linga of Siva, the storehouse of mercy, along with the articles he used for worshipping.

36. On seeing these, the boy was much surprised in his mind. He got up immediately. It seemed as if he was immersed in the ocean of great bliss.

37. He eulogised and bowed to Siva again and again. When the sun set the boy came out of the Siva temple.

38. Then he saw his own camp as beautiful as the city of Indra. It had been suddenly transformed into one of gold, of variegated nature and shining much.

39. He entered the house equipped with everything brilliant and glittering in the night. Jewels and gold pieces were scattered everywhere. He was joyous.

40. There he saw his mother sleeping. She was like a celestial lady with all divine characteristics. Her limbs shone and glittered with ornamental jewelry.

41. O brahmins, then that son, the special object of

Siva’s blessings, excited due to happiness awakened his mother immediately.

42. Getting up and seeing everything unprecedentedly wonderful, she was as it were immersed in great bliss. She embraced her son.

43. Hearing everything of the benign favour of the lord of Parvati from her son she sent word of it to the monarch who was worshipping Siva constantly.

44. The king who had concluded the observance of rites during the night came there immediately and saw the refulgence of the cowherd’s son in propitiating Siva.

45. On seeing everything in the company of his ministers and chief priest the king was immersed in the ocean of great bliss and emboldened.

46. Shedding tears of love and repeating the names of Siva with pleasure, the king Candrasena embraced the boy.

47. O brahmins, there was a great and wonderful jubilation. Excited with happiness they sang the glorious songs of lord Siva.

48. On account of this wonderful event, this manifestation of the greatness of Siva and the flutter in the midst of the citizens, the night elapsed as though it was only a moment.

49. The kings who had besieged the city for an attack heard of this event in the morning through their spies.

50. Extremely surprised on hearing it the kings who had come there met together and consulted one another. The kings said:

51. This king Candrasena is a devotee of Siva and hence invincible. The king of Ujjayini, the city of Mahakala, is never distressed.

52. The king Candrasena is a great devotee of Siva inasmuch as even children in his city observe Siva’s rites.

53. Certainly Siva will be furious if we offend him. We will be doomed if Siva is furious.

54. Hence we shall make an alliance with him. In that case lord Siva will be compassionate to us.

Siila said: —

1. Thus deciding, the kings abandoned their enmity. They regained purity of mind. They were pleased. They abandoned their weapons and missiles.
2. Permitted and encouraged by Gandrasena they entered UjjayinI, the beautiful city of Mahakala and worshipped him.
3. Then they went to the house of the cowherdess. They praised her good fortune with divine blessings.
4. They were welcomed and honoured by Gandrasena there. Seated on a very worthy seat they congratulated him and were surprised.
5. Seeing the shrine of Siva and the Siva-Liriga that rose up, thanks to the power of the son of the cowherdess they fixed their mind in Siva.
6. The delighted kings sought the sympathy of Siva and presented several valuable things to the cowherd boy.
7. The kings made him the chieftain of cowherds in all their different lands.
8. In the meantime Hanumat, the brilliant lord of monkeys, worshipped by the gods manifested himself there.
9. The kings were bewildered at his arrival. They rose up in reverence and made obeisance to him perfectly humble in their devotion.
10. Worshipped by them and seated in their midst the lord of monkeys embraced the cowherd boy and glanced at the kings and said.
11. Hanumat said: O and

Weal unto ye all, kings all the souls here, listen. Except Siva there is no other goal to human beings.
12. This cowherd boy fortunately saw the worship of Siva. Without the use of mantras he worshipped Siva and attained happiness.
13. This boy, the most excellent devotee of Siva, the enhancer of the glory of cowherds, shall enjoy all pleasures here and attain salvation hereafter.
14. In his race, in the eighth generation, there will be a famous cowherd Nanda. Vi§nu himself will be born as his son, Kf§na.

69. Henceforth this cowherd boy will attain glory all over the world in the name of Ankara.

Suta said:

70. After saying this, the son of Afijana the lord of monkeys in the form of Siva mercifully glanced at the kings and Candrasena.

71. He then initiated the intelligent cowherd child Srikara with pleasure in the rites of Siva pleasing to the lord.

72. O brahmins even as all of them were glancing at Candrasena and Srikara, the delighted Hanumat vanished there itself.

73. The delighted kings who were duly honoured took leave of Candrasena and returned the way they had come.

74. The brilliant Srikara, initiated by Hanumat, propitiated Siva along with brahmins well-versed in sacred rites.

75. The king Candrasena and Srikara, the cowherd boy, worshipped Mahakala with great devotion and pleasure.

76. In due course, Srikara and Candrasena propitiating Mahakala attained the great region of lord Siva.

77. Such is the phallic form of Siva Mahakala, the goal of the good, the slayer of the wicked in every respect who is favourably disposed towards his devotees.

78. Thus the great secret, the sanctifying narrative that bestows all happiness, conducive to heaven and enhancing devotion to Siva has been narrated to you.

147. Aftjani, mother of Hanumat, was the daughter of Kunjara and wife of Kesarin. Once she was seated on the summit of a mountain, her garment was slightly displaced and the god of wind being enamoured of her beauty assumed a visible form and asked her to yield to his desires. She requested him not to violate her chastity to which he consented. But since he fixed his desire on her she conceived a son who was named Hanumat.

# CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

# [The greatness of the Jyotirlihga Omkareivara]

The sage said:

1. O Suta, O fortunate Suta, a wonderful story has been narrated of Mahakala, the phallic image of Siva that protects his devotees.
2. O foremost of the wise, please describe the fourth Jyotirliriga of the great lord, the destroyer of all sins, in Omkara.

Suta said:

O brahmins, O great sages, I shall describe to you with pleasure how the phallic image of lord Siva named Paramefo manifested from Omkara. Let it be heard.
Once, the holy sage Narada served with great devotion the phallic form of Siva named Gokarna after going there.
From there the excellent sage came to Vindhya, the lord of mountains. He was duly worshipped by the mountain with great honour.
“Everything is present in me. I am not deficient in anything.” It was with this obsession that he sat in front of Narada.
On knowing his arrogance, Narada the dispeller of pride heaved a sigh and stayed there. On hearing that Vindhya spoke again.

Vindhya said:

“What deficiency do you observe in me that you heave this deep breath?” On hearing these words, the great sage Narada spoke again.

Narada said:

Everything is present in you. But Meru is loftier. He is classified among gods. But you, never,

148. It is one of the seven kula-parvatas. It forms the dividing line between the north and the south. It is the source of Narmadfi, Saras.i and other rivers. Various legends are associated with its name.

Suta said:

10. After saying this Narada left the place and went in the manner he had come. Vindhya was distressed. “O fie upon my life”, he exclaimed.

11. “I shall propitiate Siva, the lord of the universe and perform penance.” Deciding thus in his mind he sought refuge in Siva.

12. With great pleasure he went to the place where Omkara himself was present. There he made an earthen idol of Siva.

13. Continuously for six months he propitiated Siva. Engaged in meditation on Siva he never moved from the place of penance.

14. On seeing the penance of Vindhya, Siva, the delighted consort of Parvati, revealed to him his real form inaccessible even to the Yogins.

15. Delightedly he said— “Tell me what you wish in your mind. I am delighted with your penance. I fulfil the desires of my devotees.”

Vindhya said:

16. O lord of gods, if you are delighted, give me such intellect as I may achieve my object. O Siva, you are always favourably disposed towards your devotees.

Suta said:

17. On hearing that, lord Siva thought within himself—“This Vindhya of deluded intellect desires for a boon capable of harassing others.

18. What shall I do? I shall grant him that boon which being auspicious for him may not harass others?”

Suta said:

19. Still Siva granted him that excellent boon— “O Vindhya, king of mountains, do as you please.”

20. At this time the gods and the sages worshipped Siva and said—“You must stay here.”

21. On hearing the words of the gods, the delighted lord Siva did so with pleasure for the happiness of the worlds.

22. The phallus image of Siva known as Omkara is twofold. In the Pranava, Sada£iva came to be known as Oriikara.

23. What is born of the earthen idol became Parame-£vara. Both of them yield the desires of the devotees. O brahmins, they yield worldly pleasures and salvation.

24. The gods and the sages performed his worship then. After propitiating the bull-bannered deity they attained many boons.

25. O brahmins, the gods returned to their abodes. Vindhya was much delighted. He realised his object and eschewed his despair.

26. He who worships Siva in this manner will not stay in the mother’s womb. He will obtain all the fruits desired. There is no doubt in this.

27. Thus I have narrated to you the fruit of worshipping Omkara. Hereafter I shall mention the glory of Kedara, the excellent phallic form of Siva.

# {The greatness of the Jyotirlihga Kedareivara}

Suta said: O brahmins, the incarnations of Vi$nu—Nara and Narayana performed their penance in the Bharata Khanda in the hermitage of BadarikaSrama. 149

1. Requested by them for their worship, Siva, being subservient to the devotees comes every day to that earthen phallic image of Siva.

2. A long time elapsed while these two incarnations of Visnu, the spiritual sons of Siva, performed the worship of Siva. On one occasion the delighted Siva told them—“I am delighted. Choose your boon from me.”

149. It is the peak of the main Himalaya range in Gaihtival. It has the temple of Nara-Narayang and is a sacred place of pilgrimage. For details see GEAMI.

# 5.

When he said this, Nara and Narayana spoke these words keeping in mind the welfare of the world. Nora and Narayana said:

# 6.

O lord of gods, if you are delighted, if the boon is to be granted by you, O Siva, stay here in your own form and accept the devotion of your devotees.

# 7.

Suta said: Thus requested, lord Siva himself stayed in Kedara on the Himavat in the form of Jyotirlinga.

# 8.

He was worshipped by them for helping the worlds and for appearing in the presence of the devotees. He destroys their miseries and terrors.

# 9.

Then Siva himself stayed there in the name of Kedaresvara. By his sight and worship he bestows the desires of the devotees.

# 10.

The gods and the sages of yore worship here. They get the fruit of their desire from the delighted lord Siva.

# 11.

Since the residents of Badarikasrama derive their desires every day by worshipping him, he is called the bestower of the desires of his devotees ever.

# 12.

From that day onwards, if anyone worships Kedaresvara with devotion he will not suffer distress even in dreams.

# 13.

It was he who on seeing Pandavas assumed the form of a buffalo, having recourse to his magical skill and began to run away.

# 14.

When he was caught by the Pandavas he stood with his face bent down. They held his tail and implored him again and again.

# 15.

He remained in that form in the name of Bhaktavatsala. His head portion went and remained fixed in the city of Nayapala. 150 The lord stood in that form there.

# 16.

He asked them to worship him in that trunkless form. Worshipped by them, Siva remained there and granted boons.

# 17.

The Pandavas went away with joy after worshipping him.

ping him. After obtaining what they desired in their minds, they were rid of all their miseries.

18. There in the shrine of Kedara, Siva is directly worshipped by the Indian people.

19-20. lie who makes a gift of a ring or a bracelet after going there becomes a beloved of Siva. He comes very near the form of Siva. He is endowed with the form of Siva. On seeing that form of Siva, a person gets rid of sins. By going to Badari forest he becomes a living liberated soul.

21. On seeing the forms of Nara, Narayana and Kedaresvara, undoubtedly he can achieve liberation.

22. The devotees of Kedaresa who die on the way are released from rebirth. No doubt need be entertained in this respect.

23. Going there, with pleasure, worshipping Kedaresa and drinking the water there a person is released from re-birth. O brahmins, Bharata country people should

25. Although he is the lord of the universe still he is particularly the lord of Bharata. There is no doubt that Siva Kedara is the bestower of all desires.

26. O excellent sages, I have narrated to you what you have asked for. On hearing this narrative the sins disappear at once. No doubt need be entertained in this regard.

2. With a desire to bless the worlds Siva himself, the receptacle of welfare and happiness, took his incarnation in Kamarupa.151

3. O great sages, I shall tell you why Siva, the benefactor of the people, took the incarnation. Please listen with respect.

4. O brahmins, formerly there was a Rak?asa of great virility named Bhima who harassed all living beings and who spoiled virtuous rites always.

5. This powerful demon was born of Karkati from Kumbhakarna. He took up residence on the Sahya152 mountain along with his mother.

6. When Kumbhakarna, the terror of the worlds, was killed by Rama, the ogress remained on the Sahya alone in the company of her son.

7. O brahmins, once Bhima, the wicked tormentor of the worlds, of terrible exploits, while yet a boy asked his mother Karkati.

Bhima said:

8. O mother, who is my father? Where is he? How is it that you are living alone? I wish to know everything. Please tell me the truth.

Suta said:

9. Asked thus by her son the defiled ogress spoke to her son. Listen, I shall tell you.

Karkati said:

10. Your father was Kumbhakarna the younger brother of Ravana. That powerful demon was killed by Rama along with his brother.

11. Once that powerful demon Kumbhakarna had been here. He caught me forcefully and enjoyed me.

12. That powerful demon left me here itself and re-

14. When my husband was killed I stayed with my parents. My parents are dead now, reduced to ashes by a certain sage.

15. When they had been there for food, the infuriated disciple of Agastya, the noble Sutiksna of good penance reduced them to ashes.

16. That was why I happened to be alone on this mountain, miserable and helpless.

17. It was during this period that Kumbhakarna the younger brother of Ravana came here and had his sexual intercourse with me. He left me alone and went away.

18. You were born after that. You have great strength and exploit. Depending on you I spend my days here.

Suta said:

19. On hearing this, Bhima of terrible exploits was angry and thought “What am I to do against Vi§nu?

20. My father was killed by him and so my grand parents. Viradha too was killed by him. Many miseries have been inflicted on us. my mother

The gods said:— demon

27. If not, we shall be scorched by his terrible fiery splendour and court ruin. Hence grant him his prayer.

Suta said:

28. On hearing their words, Brahma the grandfather of the universe went there to grant him the boon and spoke thus.

Brahma said:

29. “I am delighted with you. Mention the boon you desire in your mind.” On hearing the words of Brahma the Raksasa said.

Brahma said:

30. O lord of gods, if you are delighted, if a boon is to be granted by you, O Lotus-seated one, grant me unequalled strength.

Suta said:

31. After saying this, the Raksasa made obeisance to Brahma. After granting him the boon, Brahma returned to his abode.

32. The Raksasa Bhima who acquired great strength from Brahma returned to his house puffed up with pride. After bowing to his mother he said.

Brahma said:

33. O mother, observe my strength. I shall work up a havoc among the gods including their chief Indra and also Visnu who goes to help them.

34. After saying this, Bhima of terrible exploit conquered the gods including Indra at the outset and ousted them from their respective positions.

35. Then in a battle he conquered Vi§flu respected even by the gods. Then joyously the Raksasa began to conquer the earth.

36. At first he went to conquer Sudaksina, the king of Kamarupa. Then he fought a terrible battle with him.

37. Thanks to the powers of Brahma and that of the

boon, the Asura Bhlma conquered that great king though he was a great hero and had the support of Siva.

38. After conquering the lord of Kamarupa, Bhima of terrible exploit bound him and struck him.

39. O brahmins, all that belonged to that king who was a servant of Siva, including his kingdom and its adjuncts was seized by that wicked Bhima.

40. The virtuous king, fond of sacred rites, a favourite of Siva, was bound with fetters and imprisoned in an isolated cell.

41. There the captive monarch made an excellent earthen idol of Siva and started its worship with a desire for pleasant results.

42. He eulogised Ganga in various ways. He performed the rites of ablutions and the worship of Siva.

43. He performed meditation duly in accordance with the rules prescribed for the worship of earthen idols.

44. He joyously worshipped Siva after performing obeisances, prayers and the like with the mystic signs and poses.

45. He repeated the japas of the five-syllabled mantra with the Pranava prefixed. He did not get any leisure to do anything else.

46. The king’s beloved wife, the chaste lady, famous as Daksina performed the worship of the earthen idol with pleasure.

47. The couple, devoutly engaged in the propitiation of Siva worshipped the deity, the benefactor of the devotees with single-mindedness.

48. But the Raksasa deluded by the arrogance due to the boon spoiled all sacrificial rites saying, “Let the offerings be made to me.”

49. O excellent sages, with a huge army of wicked Raksasas he put the entire earth under his control.

50. Defiling the Vedic rites and the sacred rituals of Sastras, Smrtis and Puriinas, the powerful demon enjoyed everything himself.

51. The gods including Indra were harassed by him. The sages were subjected to misery, Brahmins were ousted from the world.

# Sivapurdna

52. Then the dejected gods and sages including Indra, with Brahma and Vi§nu at their head, sought refuge in Siva.

53. On the auspicious banks of the Mahakosi they delighted Siva, the benefactor of the worlds after eulogising him with various prayers.

54. They made the earthen idol and performed worship in accordance with the rules and eulogised him with different prayers and obeisances duly.

55. Thus eulogised by means of prayers, by the gods, Siva was much delighted and spoke to the gods. Siva said:

56. O Visnu, O Brahma, O gods, O sages, I am delighted, mention the boon you wish to have. What shall I do for you?

Suta said:

57. O brahmins, when these words were mentioned by Siva, the gods spoke to Siva after bowing to him with palms joined in reverence. The gods said:

58. O lord of gods, you know everything in the mind of others. You are the immanent soul. There is nothing unknown to you. Your behest, O lord, we shall mention our grief. Be pleased to hear.

59. Still at your merciful eye, lord, look at us.

60. The Rak$asa, the powerful son of Karkatf, begot by Kumbhakarna, harasses the gods always, with his strength enhanced by the boon granted by Brahma.

61. Please kill this Rak$asa who causes much misery. O great lord, be merciful. O lord, do not delay.

Suta said: Thus by gods, Siva favourably requested — the him/* He disposed to his devotees said “I shall slay then spoke to the gods.

65. I shall kill Bhima who is wicked, whose power is enhanced by the boon granted by Brahma and who has insulted you.

Suta said:

66. Then the gods went there. The delighted gods informed the great king what lord Siva had said.

67. After informing him thus, the gods were highly delighted. The sages then returned to their respective abodes.

# CHAPTER TWENTYONE

# (The origin of the Jyotirlinga Bhimeivara)

Suta said:

1. With a desire to accord benefit to him Siva stayed with his devotee along with his Ganas. In order to protect him he remained concealed there.

2. In the meantime a great meditation was started by the lord of Kamarupa in front of the earthen idol of Siva.

3. Then somebody informed the Raksasa, “The king is performing a black magic against you.”

Suta said:

4. On hearing it the Raksasa was infuriated. With a desire to kill him he seized a sword and rushed at the king.

5-6. On seeing the earthen idol of Siva, the Raksasa

1336

thought “Contemplating on this idol he is doing something. Hence I shall kill him along with his adjuncts.” # Thinking thus the extremely infuriated Rakṣasa spoke thus.

Bhima said:

# 7.

O wicked king, what are you doing here? Tell me the truth. I shall not kill you then. Otherwise I will certainly kill you.

Suta said:

# 8.

On hearing his words, the lord of Kamarupa full of faith in Siva thought within his mind thus.

# 9.

What is destined to happen will happen. There is nothing to prevent it. Everything is determined by our own previous action and Siva is the dispenser of the result.

# 10.

The merciful lord is certainly present in this earthen idol. He is carrying out my task. Who is this Rakṣasa? Whence has he come?

# 11.

Lord Siva is reputed in the Vedas as true to his promise. He carries out his promises in the interest of his devotees.

# 12.

The promise is “If and when any terrible person harasses my devotee I shall kill that wicked person in order to save him. There is no doubt in this.”

# 13.

Thus emboldened and meditating on lord Siva the king reminded him of the promise, mentally and devotedly.

# 14.

“O lord, I am yours. Do as you wish. I will tell him the truth. Do what is beneficial to me,”

# 15.

Thus meditating in his mind, the king bound by the noose of truth spoke the truth slighting the Rakṣasa.

The king said:

# 16.

I am worshipping lord Siva who protects his devotees, who is the lord of all beings — mobile or immobile and who is free from aberrations.

Suta said:

# 17.

On hearing these words of the king of Kamarupa, Bhima spoke thunderingly, his body shaking with rage.

# Ko firudrasarhhitd

Bhima said:

1. Your Siva is known to me? What harm can he do to me? He was kept as a servant by my uncle.
2. You wish to conquer me depending on his strength. Then you have conquered everything, indeed. No need for any hesitation.
3. As long as Siva your protector is not seen by me you can serve him as your lord and not otherwise.
4. If he is seen by me, O king, everything will be clear in every respect. Hence you remove all these idols of Siva.
5. Otherwise great terror will befall you. There is no doubt about it. I am of terrible exploit - and I shall lay my hands heavily on your lord.

Suta said:

On hearing his words, the king of Kamarupa who had steady faith in Siva immediately spoke to the Rak$asa. The king said:
I am a wicked ignorant brute in your eyes but I shall never forsake Siva. My lord who is the most excellent of all will never forsake me.

Suta said:

On hearing the words of the king with his soul dedicated to Siva, the Raksasa laughed and spoke to the king immediately.

Bhima said:

“He is intoxicated. He begs everyday. What does he know about his features? What steadfastness can a Yogi have in affording protection to his devotees?”
Think thus and keep aloof in every respect. Your lord and I shall proceed with our fight.

Suta said:

Thus ridiculed, the excellent king, a devotee of Siva, steadfast in his rites, spoke fearlessly to Bhima who caused misery to the people.

# Swapur&#x26;ga

The king said:

# 29.

O wicked Raksasa, listen. I shall not comply with your threats. If you go astray wherefore are you powerful?

# 30.

The Suta said: Thus addressed by the king, the demon rebuked him and hurled his terrible sword at the earthen idol.

# 31.

“See now itself your lord’s strength pleasing to the devotees.” Saying this, the powerful demon laughed in the company of the Raksasas.

# 32.

O brahmins, no sooner did the sword touch the earthen idol than Siva manifested himself from the earthen idol.

# 33.

“See, I am Bhime§vara. I have revealed myself to protect my devotee. This is my old rite that the devotee should be protected by me always.

# 34.

From this alone see soon my strength that is pleasing to the devotees.” After saying this he split the sword into two with his Pinaka.

# 35.

His spear was then hurled by the Raksasa. That spear too of the wicked Raksasa was split into a hundred pieces by Siva.

# 36.

O brahmins, then a lance was hurled at Siva by him. It too was split into a hundred-thousand pieces with his arrows by Siva.

# 37.

Then a huge iron club was hurled at Siva by him. Within a trice, it too was reduced to small pieces like gingelly seeds by Siva with his trident.

# 38.

Then a terrible fight ensued between the attendants of Siva and the Raksasa. It frightened all the onlookers with distress.

# 39.

Within a trice, the entire earth became agitated. The oceans and the mountains became excited.

# 40.

The god and the sages were much distressed. They said to one another, “In vain did we beseech Siva.”

# 41.

Narada came there and requested Siva, the destroyer of miseries with palms joined in reverence and head bent down.

# N&#x26;rada said:

42. O lord, forgive, O cause of fierce agitation. Why shall a dagger be thrust to cut a blade of grass, Let the demon be killed soon.

43. Thus requested, lord Siva reduced the Rakgasa to ashes with only a Hum sound for his weapon. O

44. Even as all the gods were watching, sage, the Raksasas were burnt down by Siva in a trice.

45. Just as the conflagration consumes the forest so did the fury of Siva destroy the army of the Raksasas in a trice.

46. None could see even the ashes of Bhlma. He was burnt down along with his followers. There was no trace of him to be seen.

47. The flame of the fury of Siva spread from forest to forest. The ashes of the Raksasas spread everywhere in the forest.

48. The fiery flame of the anger of the great lord Siva came out and spread from forest to forest. The ashes of the Raksasas spread throughout the forest.

49. From the ashes different herbs cropped up effectively in various ways. Men could assume different forms and features through the ashes.

50. Evil spirits, ghosts are removed far by the ashes brahmins, there is no task which cannot be carried out through it.

51. Then Siva was implored by the gods and sages “O lord, you should stay here itself for the happiness of the people.

# CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO

# (The greatness of Vtivefvaray the arrival of Rudra at KjiU)

Suta said:

1. O excellent sages, hereafter I shall narrate the greatness of Visvesvara, destructive of great sins. May it be heard.

2-3. That which is seen as the substantive, as an entity in the form of knowledge and bliss, eternal and free from aberration, desired for a second. That second, of the tree of salvation, was possessed of attributes. It is named Siva.

4. That split itself into two in the male and the female forms. The male is famous as Siva and the female is known as Sakti.

5-6. O great sages, the unseen Cit and Ananda created Prakrti and Purusa. O brahmins, on seeing their parents, Prakrti and Purusa were plunged in doubt.

— Then a voice arose from the great attributeless Atman “Penance shall be pursued by you for the generation of excellent creation.”

7. Prakrti and Purusa said:

8. O lord Siva, there is no place for penance. Where shall we sit and perform this penance at your behest?

9-10. Then a beautiful city endowed with the requisite articles, the auspicious essence of brilliance extending to five Kro£as was created and established by Siva devoid of attributes, in the firmament near the Purusa.

11. Occupying it with a desire for creation and meditating, Visnu performed penance for a long time.

12. Due to his exertion various currents of water began to flow. The void was pervaded by the water-currents. Nothing else was seen.

13. On seeing it and thinking “What is this wonderful thing in sight”, Visnu shook his head.

14. Then a jewel fell in front from the ear of the lord. It became the great holy centre named Manikarnika.

15. When the holy centre extending to five Krolas...



---

Kofirudrasarfihitd
began to float on the waters, it was supported on Trident by Siva devoid of attributes.

16. Visnu slept there itself along with his consort Pra-krti. At the behest of Siva, Brahma was born of his umbilical lotus.

17. At the behest of Siva, he evolved a wonderful creation. The fourteen worlds were created in the Cosmic Egg.

18. The extent of the Cosmic Egg is fifty crores of Yojanas as glorified by the sages.

19. “How will the beings in the Cosmic Egg bound by action attain me otherwise?”, the holy centre of Pafica-kro$I was released by him after thinking like this.

20. “This KasI is the bestower of auspiciousness in the world. It is destructive of action. It illuminates salvation. It is the bestower of knowledge. It is my great favourite.

21. The phallic image Avimukta is installed by the great Siva himself. O you born of my parts, this holy centre should never be abandoned by you.”

22. After saying this, Siva himself brought Ka£ika from his Trident and released it in the mortal world.

23. At the close of the day of Brahma (when all other objects perish) it certainly does not perish. Then, O sages, Siva upholds it by means of his Trident.

24. O brahmins, when the creation is resumed again by Brahma it is replaced. It is called Ka£i because it pulls out or destroys our actions.

25. The phallic image Avimuktesvara stays in K&#x26;il always, yielding salvation to the people including even the great sinners.

salvation arc attained elsewhere. The excellent type of salvation Sayujya is attained here alone.

27. Of those who do not attain salvation elsewhere, the city of Varanasi is the resort. The meritorious holy centre Paflcakro£i is destructive of sins of crores of slaughter.

28. The immortal gods too desire death here. What then of others? Thus holy centre yields worldly pleasures and salvation always. It is a favourite resort of Siva.

29. Brahma praises this city. So also do the Siddhas, Yogins, sages and other people in the three worlds and Visnu too.

30. I cannot describe adequately and entirely the greatness of Kail even in hundreds of years. I shall explain to the extent I can.

31. The lord of Kailasa, who is Sattvaic within and Tamasaic without, who is famous in the name of KJiligni and who is the supreme Being with and without attributes spoke after making many obeisances.

Suta said:

2. O great sages, I shall explain neatly and succinctly the splendid greatness of Varanasi and Vi$ve$vara. May it be listened to.

3. Once goddess Parvati asked Siva with great joy about the greatness of the two Avimuktas —Kasi and Vi$ve$vara, out of desire for the welfare of the worlds.

5. On hearing the words of the goddess, the lord of the gods, the lord of the universe, replied to her for the pleasure of all living beings.

Lord Siva said:

6. What, gentle lady, has been asked by you is splendid. It is auspicious and pleasing to the people. I shall explain as a matter of fact the greatness of the two Avimuktas.

7. Varanasi is my mysterious shrine. It is the cause of salvation for the people in every respect.

8. In this holy centre, the Siddhas have always taken to my holy rites. They hold different phallic images. They yearn to attain my world.

9. Those who have conquered themselves and controlled their sense-organs pursue the great Paiupata Yoga which is explained in the Vedas, yielding worldly pleasures and salvation.

10. O great goddess, the residence in Varanasi is always appealing to me. Forsaking everything listen to the cause of its greatness.

11. The two deserve liberation he who is devotee and he who has perfect knowledge. Their is not the dependence on holy centres. They are equanimous in regard to what is prescribed and what is forbidden.

12. They must be known as liberated souls, no matter where they die. They are sure to attain salvation. This decisive word has been uttered by me.

13. Here in this excellent holy centre Avimukta, there is one special thing to be noted. O goddess, O great £akti, please listen attentively.

14. People of all castes, of all stages of life, whether children, youths or the aged, if they die in this city, are undoubtedly liberated.

15*16. O brahmins, whether pure or impure, whether virgin or married, whether widow or barren, whether suffering from menstrual disorders or defects or whether recently delivered of a child, of whatever nature she may be, if she

dies at this holy centre she attains salvation. There is no doubt in this.

# 17.

The sweat-born, (lice, bugs etc.) the egg-born (birds), the germinating ones (plants and trees) and the embryo-born (mammals) these living beings do not attain salvation elsewhere as they do at this place.

# 18.

O goddess, there is no dependence on perfect knowledge here, nor that on devotion, nor that on holy rites, nor that on charitable gifts.

# 19.

There is no dependence on culture, nor that on meditation at any time, nor that on repetition of names, nor that on adoration, nor that even on noble nativity.

# 20.

Whoever may be the man staying in my holy centre, whatever may be the manner of his death, if he dies here, he certainly attains salvation.

# 21.

O beloved, this divine city of mine is most mysterious one. O Parvati, even Brahma and others do not know its greatness.

# 22.

Hence this holy centre is known as Avimukta. It is greater than Naimisa and all other holy centres in yielding salvation to the deceased.

# 23.

Truth is the esoteric doctrine of Dharmas. Equanimity is the esoteric doctrine of salvation. Learned men know Avimukta as the esoteric doctrine of all shrines and holy centres.

# 24.

Any being, enjoying pleasures at his will, sleeping, sporting or performing different activities, attains salvation if he casts off his life at Avimukta.

# 25.

It is far better for men to become ghost after committing thousands of sins and stay at Kashi than to attain heaven after performing a thousand sacrifices but without going to the city of Kashi.

# 26.

Hence the people resort to Kashi with every strenuous effort. The sages meditate on Sada Shiva in the form of his phallic image.

# 27.

O beloved, I distribute the different fruits among different men who perform penance with those ends in view.

# 28.

No entanglement of actions binds those who...



---


cast off their bodies here. Afterwards they realise complete identity with the godhead as their goal.

1. Brahma along with the gods and the sages, Vi$nu, the sun, and all other noble souls perform my worship.
2. He who dies in this holy centre does not get rebirth even if he happens to be a person whose mind is drawn towards sensual pleasures or who has eschewed interest in virtue.
3. What then, if they are free from attachment, devoid of arrogance, possessed of Sattvaic nature, blessed ones devoted to me and not initiating evil activities.
4. Among thousands of rebirths, a Yogin is born here. Then, dying here, he attains the highest salvation.
5. O Parvati, there are many phallic forms installed by my devotees. They yield all desires and bestow salvation too.
6. This holy centre is glorified as extending to five Kronas in every one of the four directions all round. At the time of death it yields immortal beatitude.
7. If a sinless man dies, he attains salvation immediately. If a sinner dies here he assumes multitudes of births.
8. He attains salvation only after experiencing tortures. He who commits sins in the holy centre of Avimukta experiences tortures at the hands of OBhairava for ten thousand years and then attains salvation, beautiful lady.
9. Thus the course of events in regard to one who commits sins has been narrated to you. A man should realise this and worship Avimukta properly.
10. An action once performed is never wasted even in hundreds of crores of Kalpas. Good or bad, one must of necessity enjoy the fruit of one’s action.
11. Exclusively inauspicious action is contributory to hellish distress. Exclusively auspicious action is conducive to the attainment of heaven. A mixture of the two is said to be resulting in human birth.
12. The birth will be good or evil in accordance with the predominance or deficiency of the one or the other.

# Kofitudnuarhkiti

The annihilation of good and evil is liberation. This is the truth, O Parvati.

# 42.

O great goddess, the action that causes bondage is said to be threefold as mentioned in the Karmakantja section of the Vedas. It is (1) hoarded (Saficita) (2) the current (Kriyamana) and (3) that which has started yielding results (Prarabdha).

# 43-44.

The actions of the previous births are classified as hoarded. The action the fruit of which is being experienced in the present birth is Prarabdha. Whether good or bad the action performed in this birth is known as Kriyamana.

# 45.

The annihilation of the Prarabdha Karman is only through enjoyment and not otherwise. The destruction of the other two types of action is possible through worship alone.

# 46.

Except in Ka§I in no other place can all the actions be wiped off. The other holy centres are easily accessible but the city of KaSi is difficult of access.

# 47.

If Ka£i had been visited with devotion in the previous birth, the person in the present birth reaches Ka$I and dies there and not otherwise.

# 48.

If after reaching Ka£i a man takes his ceremonial bath in the Ganges, the two types of actions viz. the current and the hoarded are destroyed.

# 49.

It is certain that the Prarabdha is not destroyed except through enjoyment. When that is enjoyed it is also destroyed.

# 50.

If a man visits Kali first and commits sin afterwards, the seed of that action takes him again to Ka£i.

# 51.

Then his sins are reduced to ashes. Hence a man shall resort to K3ii. That certainly debars Karmans to fructify.

153. Man's actions are classified into three categories, viz. (i) past actions still unfructified, (ii) past actions beginning to fructify, (iii) present actions awaiting fructification in future. According to the present context, the action of the second category (Prarabdha) is exhaustible by the consumption of its fruit. The remaining two can be checked from further growth by performing the rites of Siva.

O beloved, if even a single brahmin is afforded shelter and residence at Ka£i, the man who affords shelter and residence, gets the benefit of residence in Ka£i himself and thence he attains salvation.

If a person dies in Ka£i, he is freed from rebirth. If a man dies at Prayaga, his desires for worldly enjoyment and salvation are fulfilled.

If both the desire for worldly enjoyment and salvation are fulfilled at Prayaga, the fruit of salvation derived from residence in Ka£i is likely to be in vain. If only the fruit of salvation is the goal, the fruits of Prayaga are likely to be in vain.

Hence at my behest, Vi$nu creates something afresh and accords him the fruit as mentally conceived by him.

Suta said: O excellent sages, such things constitute the greatness of Kasi and Visveivara yielding worldly pleasures and salvation to the good.

Hereafter I shall explain the greatness of Tryambaka on hearing which a man gets rid of his sins altogether.

# CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR

The greatness of Gautama in the context of the greatness of Trymbake$vara

Suta said: O excellent sages, listen. I shall tell you the story that dispels sins in the manner I have heard it from Vyasa, the good preceptor.

The holy Prayiga yields worldly desires as well as emancipation; the holy grants emancipation only. For him who desires both the worldly enjoyment and emancipation, Ka£i is useless, for he can get these at Prayaga. For him who desires emancipation alone, Prayaga is of no avail, for he can get the same at Ka£i.

# Kofirudrasarfihita

1. Formerly there was an excellent sage named Gautama. His wife Ahalya was extremely virtuous.

2. There was a penance extending to ten thousand years performed by him on the Brahmagiri mountain in the southern quarter.

3. O great ones of good rites, once a terrible drought lasting for a hundred years occurred there. All the people were put to great distress.

4. Not a single juicy tender sprout was seen on the face of the earth. How could there be water, the sustainer of living beings?

5. Then the sages and other men, the beasts, birds and the deer of the forest went to the different quarters.

6. On seeing the drought, the sages and the brahmins spent the horrible time in meditation and performing Pranayamas.

7. Gautama himself performed an auspicious penance of Varuna for six months engrossed in Pranayama.

8. Then Varuna came there to grant him the boon. He said — “I am delighted. Mention the boon you wish to have. I shall grant it.”

9. O brahmins, then Gautama requested him for rain. Then Varuna replied to the sage.

10. Varuna said: How can I countermand the behest of the gods? Please ask for something else. You are a wise man. I shall grant it.

11. Suta said: On hearing these words of Varuna the great Atman, Gautama, eager to help others spoke thus.

12. Gautama said: O lord of gods, if you are delighted, if a boon is to be granted to me, you shall grant it according to my desire.

13. I is a mountain lying at a distance of twenty miles from Nasik district, near Tryambaka in which the Goddvari has its source on which the sage Gautama had his hermitage. Padma P. VI. 176. 58.

14. Since you are the lord of waters, you shall give me water. O lord of gods, you shall give me divine ever-lasting water yielding permanent results.

Stita said: Requested thus by Gautama, Varuna said—“Please dig a ditch here”.

16. When this was said, a ditch of a hand’s depth was dug by him. It was filled with divine water by Varuna.

17. Then lord Varuna the king of waters spoke to Gautama, the excellent sage, eager to help others.

Varuna said:

18. O great sage, let there be a perennial supply of water in this ditch that has become sacred. This will become famous on the earth by your name.

19. Charitable gifts made here, rites performed here, penance pursued here, the sacrifices done here for the gods and the Sraddha offered to the manes, everything will be imperishable.

Suta said:

20. After saying this, the lord eulogised by that sage vanished. After rendering help to others, the sage Gautama too was happy.

21. Seeking the support of great men is conducive to greatness. Only great men see its real nature, not others, the inauspicious ones.

22. Man attains fruits in accordance with the nature of the man one serves. Loftiness is achieved by serving the great and meanness by serving the mean.

23. Service in the abode of a lion is sure to yield pearls. Service in the hutment of a jackal is profitable only in yielding bones.

24. This is the nature of the excellent people that they cannot bear others' misery. They consider others' misery their own and try to eradicate it.

25. Trees, gold, sandal paste and the sugarcane exist for the enjoyment of the people. Men similarly competent are very rare in the world.

Kofimdrasarfihitd 1351

26. A kind man, a man unpuffed by arrogance a person habitually helping others and a person with perfect control over his sense-organs, these are the four holy pillars that support the earth.

27. Having secured rare water thus, Gautama performed his routine and ceremonial rites duly.

28. Thereafter he sowed different food-grains and barleys there itself for the performance of his sacrifice.

29. Different kinds of food-grains, trees, flowers and fruits were produced in plenty there.

30. On hearing of it, the sages came there in thousands. Many beasts, birds and other living beings flocked there.

31. The forest became very beautiful, the most excellent on the surface of the world. In view of this imperishable contact the drought was not distressing.

32. The sages in the forest were engaged in auspicious rites. They stayed there along with their disciples, children and womenfolk.

33. They sowed food-grains for their livelihood. There was great joy and bliss in that forest, thanks to the power of Gautama.

(The planned arrangement of Gautama Suta said: O brahmins, once Gautama sent his disciples there for water.

1. Carrying out his orders they reached the spot with the water-pots in their hands.

2. Many of the womenfolk who had assembled there for water saw the disciples of Gautama who had come for water. They prevented them from taking water.

The sage Gautama. The wife of the sage took them with her, pacified those women, herself took water and gave it to Gautama. The excellent sage performed the routine rites with that water.

6. The other women, the wives of the sages, became infuriated and rebuked her. They returned to their huts with evil intentions lurking in their minds.

7. The entire incident was distorted and intimated to their husbands by those evil-minded women.

8. On hearing their words, the great sages became furious with Gautama as it was destined to be.

9. The infuriated sages of crooked intellect worshipped Gane£a with various articles of worship in order to put obstacle in the activity of Gautama.

10. The delighted Gane£vara who is subservient to the devotees and who is the bestower of benefits appeared before them and said.

Gansla said:

11. “I am pleased with you. Mention the boon you wish to choose. What shall I do?” On hearing his words the sages said then.

The sages said:

12. If the boon is to be given by you, let Gautama be turned out of his hermitage after being rebuked by the sages. Please do so.

SGta said:

13. On being requested thus, the elephant-faced deity,188 the goal of the good, laughed and said gently enlightening them.

GaneSa said:— O

16. Excellent results are sought after performing penance. No harm is sought after voluntarily eschewing auspicious results.

Suta said:

17. Even after hearing these words, the excellent sages, still deluded in their intellect, spoke these words.

The sages said:

18. “O lord, this must be done by you. Not otherwise.” GaniJa who was thus implored spoke.

Ganeia said:

19. This has been decisively said by Brahma: A wicked man never attains saintly nature nor does a saintly man assume perversion at any time.

20. Formerly when you were distressed by starvation, the sage Gautama afforded you happiness.

21. Now you intend to inflict misery on him. This is not proper. Please think over this in all aspects.

22. Deluded by your women-folk you never cared to act by my advice. There is no doubt that my advice will be beneficial to him at the end.

23. Certainly the excellent sage will render happiness unto you. Deception is not proper. Please choose another boon.

Suta said:

24. Although this advice was given by Ganeia, the great Atman, still the sage did not pay heed.

25. Then Ganeia, who is subservient to his devotees, spoke indifferently to those sages of evil intent.

Ganeia said:

26. I shall do what is being requested by you all. What is destined to happen will surely happen. After saying this he vanished.

27. Gautama did not know the evil intention of the

1354 SiuapurdQa sages. He went on performing his routine along with his wife with delighted mind.

28. O great sages, hear what happened in the meantime as a result of the influence of those wicked sages by the granting of the boon.

29. There were food-grains and barleys in Gautama’s field. Gancga assumed the form of a feeble cow and went there.

30. O excellent sages, staggering and faltering, the cow, as a result of the boon began to eat the food-grains and barleys.

31. In the meantime Gautama happened to come there casually. Compassionate by nature, he warded off the cow with a bunch of grass blades.

32. No sooner was it touched by the blades of grass than the cow fell down dead even as the sage was watching it.

33. The sages and their wicked wives who were hiding there began to shout, “O see, what is done by Gautama.”

34. O brahmins, the bewildered Gautama called Ahalya and spoke with a dejected, distressed mind.

Gautama said:

35. O gentle lady, what has happened? How did it happen? Certainly lord Siva is angry. What should be done? Where shall we go? The sin of slaughter has befallen me.

Suta said:

36. In the meantime the brahmins reproached Gautama. The wives of the brahmins tormented Ahalya with threats.

37. The evil-minded disciples and sons of the brahmins reviled at Gautama repeating the words, “Fie on you.”

The sages said:

38. Your face is not fit to be seen. Go hence. If a person sees the face of a cow-killer, he shall take bath in full dress.

39. As long as you stay in the midst of the hermitage, the sacrificial fires and the manes will not accept our gifts.

40. Hence, O sinner, O slayer of a cow, go somewhere else along with your followers. Do not delay.

Suta said:

41. Saying this, they pelted him with stones. They inflicted pain on him and Ahalya with insulting words.

42. Beaten and reproached by wicked persons, Gautama spoke these words: “O sages, I am going away from here. I shall stay somewhere else.”

43. After saying this, Gautama went out of that place. Going a kro£a he made his hermitage there with their permission.

44. As long as there is this curse, no rite shall be performed. You are not authorised in any of the rites of god, manes or the Vedic rituals.*

45. The excellent sage Gautama excessively distressed by this regrettable incident spent half of a month thus and then requested.

Gautama said —

46. I am to be pitied by you. Please tell me how my sin can be wiped off. I shall do as you bid me.

Suta said:

47. Thus requested the brahmins did not say anything. When they were implored humbly they met separately and remained aloof.

48. Gautama stood far off. Bowing down to the sages he humbly asked them what he should do.

49. When this was said by Gautama of noble soul, the sages spoke these words.

The sages said:

50. “Without expiation purity cannot be attained. Hence, for the sake of purification you shall perform the rites of atonement.

51. Go round the earth three times announcing your sin. After returning to this place perform the holy Vrata for a month.

The verse is misplaced in the printed Skt. text. It shall follow v. 40 above.

52. If you go round this mountain Brahmagiri a hundred and one times you can attain purity.

53. Or you fetch water from Gahga and perform the ceremonial ablution. Propitiate lord Siva making a crore of his phallic images.

54. At the outset, you circumambulate this mountain eleven times. Taking bath in Ganga you will become pure thereafter.

55. Performing the ablution of the earthen phallic image of Siva with a hundred potful of water, the expiatory rite will be completed.” When he was thus urged by the sages he said in the affirmative.

56. O excellent sages, at the behest of your honours I shall worship the earthen phallic image of Siva and also circumambulate the mountain.

57. After saying this and circumambulating the mountain, the excellent sage made earthen phallic images of Siva and worshipped them.

58. The chaste lady Ahalya too acted accordingly. Their disciples and the disciples of their disciples rendered service to them.

3. On seeing the beautiful form of Siva, the supreme soul, the sage bowed to Siva with devotion and eulogised him joyously.

4. After eulogising and bowing to him many times, Gautama stood with palms joined in reverence and said, “O lord, make me sinless.”

5. On hearing these words of the noble soul Gautama, Siva became much delighted and spoke. Siva said: O sage, you are blessed. You shall be contented. You are already sinless. You have been deceived by these wicked knaves.

6. Indeed, on seeing you, people become sinless. How can you be a sinner? You are always engaged in devotion to me. O sage, indeed, the wicked persons, by whom you have been harassed, are sinners, evil-minded and murder-stained.

7. Others too are likely to be sinners on seeing these. They have become already ungrateful. There is no way of atonement for them.

8. Siva said: After saying this, O brahmins, lord Siva, the bestower of happiness to the good and chastiser of the wicked told him their evil actions in detail.

9. On hearing the words of Siva, the sage was greatly surprised. After bowing to him with devotion, he spoke again to him with palms joined in reverence.

Gautama said: 10. O lord Siva, a great help has been rendered by these sages. If they had not done like this, how could I have had your vision?

11. Blessed indeed are the sages who have pursued this auspicious activity towards me. It is by their so-called evil action that my great self-interest is made possible;

12. Suta said: On hearing his words, lord Siva became all the more delighted. Looking at Gautama mercifully he replied,

# Sivapur^ta

Siva said: O leading brahmin, you are a blessed sage. You are the most excellent among sages. Realising that I am highly delighted, you choose the excellent boon.

SUta said: Gautama thought— “It is thus that the scandal was spread in the world. Otherwise it would not have been so. Hence I must do what is proper”. After thinking like this, the excellent sage Gautama, devoted to Siva, spoke to Siva with palms joined in reverence and head bent down. Gautama said:

O lord, what you say is true. Still what is done by the five leading persons cannot be otherwise. So, let what has happened happen. O lord of gods, if you are delighted, may Ganga be given to me. Render help to the worlds. Obeisance be to you.

SUta said: After saying these words and grasping his lotus-like feet, Gautama made obeisance to the lord of gods with a desire for the welfare of the worlds.

The essence of the earth and heaven had been extracted of yore, a part of this had been given to the sage by Brahma at his marriage. What had been held over, lord Siva favourably disposed towards his devotees, now gave to the sage.

Then the waters of Ganga assumed the form of a lady and stood there. The excellent sage eulogised her and made obeisance. Gautama said:

O Ganga, you are blessed. You are contented. The whole world has been sanctified by you. Sanctify me too. I am likely to fall into hell.

The context carries the existence of the modern PaflrSyata system to a hoary antiquity.

Sita said: Siva too then spoke O Ganga, You are beneficial to all. At my behest, sanctify Gautama also.

On hearing these words of Siva and Gautama, Ganga, the holy Sakti of Siva, spoke to Siva.

Ganga said: O lord, after sanctifying the sage along with his followers, I shall return to my abode. I am telling you the truth.

Suta said: When this was mentioned by Ganga, lord Siva, favourably disposed towards his devotees, spoke again to Ganga keeping in mind the welfare of the worlds.

Siva said: O goddess, the advent of the Kali Yuga, when the son of Vivasvat shall be the twenty-eighth Manu, you shall stay here alone.

Suta said: On hearing these words of lord Siva, Ganga the sanctifying leading river replied.

Ganga said: O lord Siva, O slayer of the Tripuras, if my greatness were to surpass that of all, I shall stay on the earth.

O lord, please listen to something more. O lord, please abide with me with this beautiful body of yours along with your consort and the Ganas.

Suta said: On hearing her words, Siva favourably disposed towards his devotees, spoke again to Ganga for rendering help to the worlds.

Siva said: O Ganga you are blessed. Listen. I am not distinct from you. Still I stay here. You too must stay.

Seta said:

35. On hearing these words of lord Siva, Gangi was delighted in the mind and she accepted his advice.

36-37. In the meantime, the gods and sages, several holy centres and holy rivers came there. Proclaiming “Be victorious, be victorious”, they respectfully worshipped Gautama, Gangi and Parvatl.

38. Thereafter Vi?nu, Brahma and other gods eulogised them joyously joining their palms and drooping down their shoulders.

39. Ganga and Parvatl were delighted and they said, “We excellent gods, mention the boon you desire to choose. We shall grant the same with a desire to do what is pleasing to you.”

The gods said:

40. “O lord of gods, O leading river, if you are delighted, you shall stay here taking pity on us and for the benefit of men.”

Gahg5 said:

41. “Why don’t you stay here for the pleasure and welfare of all? After washing off the sin of Gautama I shall go back the way I have come.”

42. “O gods, how may my speciality be known apart from yours? If you can prove the same, I shall undoubtedly stay here.”

The gods said:

43. “When Jupiter, the most friendly to all, comes to the zodiac of Leo all of us will come. There is no doubt about it.”

44-45. “O leading river, we will become unclean ourselves by cleaning off the sins of the people for eleven years. O beloved great goddess, we will come to you for washing that off in every respect. With respect we reveal this truth to you.”

46. “To bless the worlds, to do what is pleasing to us Siva shall stay here and you too, O leading river.”

47-48. We shall stay here as long as Jupiter is in Leo. We shall take our bath thrice a day and visit Siva. Then we shall get rid of our sins and with your permission return to our native lands.

Suta said:

49. Thus requested by them as well as by the sage Gautama, Siva stayed there with pleasure. The excellent river Ganga too stayed.

50. Ganga there became famous as Gautaml. The phallic image became famous by the name Trymbaka. Both are destructive of great sins.

51. From that time onwards whenever Jupiter enters Leo, the holy rivers, sacred centres and the gods come there.

52. The holy lakes Pugkara, and others, the sacred river Ganga and others, Vasudeva and other gods stay on the banks of the Gautaml river.

53. While they are here they lose sacredness in their original places. They will have it back when they return there.

54. This is a Jyotirlinga famous as Tryambaka. It is stationed on the banks of the Gautaml destructive of great sins.

55. He who sees the Jyotirlinga Tryambaka with devotion and worships with obeisance after eulogising it is freed from all sins.

56. This very Jyotirlinga Tryambaka was worshipped by Gautama. Being worshipped it yields all desires here and bestows liberation hereafter.

57. O great sages, thus what I have been asked has been narrated to you all. What else do you wish to hear? I shall explain it to you. No doubt need be entertained in this respect.

# CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN

# ( The greatness of the Jyotirlihga TryambakeSvara)

The sages said :

1. O holy lord, whence did Ganga originate in the form of water? How could it attain its greatness? Please narrate.
2. What happened to those wicked brahmins who tormented Gautama? O sage with Vyasa as your good preceptor, please narrate.

SUta said :

O brahmins, Ganga who was thus requested by Gautama immediately descended from the mountain Brahma-giri.
Its current flowed from the branches of an Udumbara tree. Gautama, the famous sage, took his bath joyously.
Gautama’s disciples and other sages too came there and joyously took their bath.
O excellent sages, the place became well known as Gangadvara. It is beautiful and its sight dispels all sins.
The sages who were malicious towards Gautama came there to take their bath; but on seeing them Ganga vanished immediately.
Then Gautama hastened to that place and eulogised Ganga again and again with palms joined in reverence and head bent down. He then spoke.

Gautama said :

Whether these are blind in their arrogance due to their affluence, whether they are good or bad, you shall grant them your vision by the virtue of this holy region.

KRS.159. Keᵣₑ GaAg&#x26; is said to have descended from Brahmagiri ($P. 25. 3) which is situated in the south (Ibid 24. 3), in the proximity of Nasik near Tryambaku. The place of GaAg&#x26;'s descent is said to be GaAg&#x26;dv£ra (Ibid. 27.6). As Brahmagiri the place of Gautama's hermitage stands in the south, GaApfldvfira cannot be identified with Haridv&#x26;ra the famous town of pilgrimage in Northern India.

Siita said: O excellent sages, then a voice arose from the firmament.

“Please listen to the excellent words that GangS spoke.

“These are the most wicked sages, most ungrateful and traitors to their lord. They are knaves and blasphemous heretics. They are unworthy of sight.”

Gautama said:

“Mother please hear the words of the great lord which you shall make truthful.

The lord has said, “I become sanctified by the person who in this world helps those who harm him.”

Sata said:

On hearing the words of the sage Gautama the great Atman, the voice rose again from the firmament above GaAga.

“O sage Gautama, what is said by you is true. These are auspicious words. Still let them perform expiatory rites in brief.

At your behest and particularly under your guidance, they shall circumambulate this mountain.

Then these wicked persons will be authorised in having a vision of mine. O sage, this truth I mention to you.

On hearing these words, the sages did so duly after dejectedly requesting Gautama, “Our offence shall be excused.”

When they did so, a ditch named Kuiavarta just beneath Gangidvira was made by Gautama with her permission.

The sacred river flowed thence for the pleasure of the sage. Kuiivarta became a famous and excellent place of pilgrimage.

A man who takes bath there becomes worthy of attaining salvation after immediately eschewing the sins and securing perfect knowledge which is difficult of access.

# 23.

O Suta, this narrative has been heard by us in another manner. 160 We shall mention it. According to that, the infuriated Gautama cursed the brahmins. May this be known to you.

Suta said: O brahmins, that that happened is also true, for in a different Kalpa. Great ones of good rites, I shall describe the particular points of that story also.

# 24.

On seeing the sages distressed by the famine, Gautama performed a great penance with god Varuna as the object of his worship.

# 25.

Through Varuna’s Maya he caused a perennial supply of water. Then he made them sow food-grains and barleys in plenty.

# 26.

Thus the excellent sage Gautama eager to help others afforded them sufficient food, thanks to the power of his penance.

# 27.

Once the wicked wives of those sages feeling insulted in an incident over taking water became furious and complained to their husbands slandering Gautama.

# 28.

With their minds thus prejudiced the evil-minded brahmins created an artificial cow grazing in his grain-field.

# 29.

On seeing a cow eating his food-grains, Gautama struck it mildly with a blade of grass trying to ward it off.

# 30.

The cow fell down immediately, being touched by the blade of grass. O brahmins, it died in an instant due to the forces of unavoidable destiny.

# 31.

Then the wicked sages held a gathering and said “O a cow has been killed by Gautama”.

# 32.

Then Gautama was frightened thinking that a cow had been killed. Along with his wife Ahalya, his disciples, the devotees of Siva, he began to wonder.

# 160.

According to the Puranic concept, the events of one Kalpa are repeated in another. But occasionally the events undergo modifications from Kalpa to Kalpa. Thus SP mentions two versions of the narrative of Gajpeia (Cp. $P. RS KumSra' Ch. 13. 5-6). The present ch. narrates two versions of Gautama's narrative; the variation is occasioned by the difference in Kalpa.

34. Then the excellent sage Gautama realised the truth and was angry. He cursed the sages.

Gautama said:—

36. You evil-minded are desiring to put me in distress as I am a devotee of Siva. Hence you shall be averse to the Vedas always.

Henceforth your faith in the rites of the Vedas, particularly with reference to the path of Siva yielding salvation shall cease to exist.

37. Henceforth your attention, strayed from the path of salvation, will be diverted to evil paths extraneous to the tenets of the Vedas.

38. From today let your foreheads be smeared with clay. Fall, ye all, deep down into the hell, O brahmins with foreheads smeared with clay.

39. You will not have Siva as your sole deity. You will be considering the matchless Siva on a par with other gods.

40. You will never have any interest in Siva’s worship and other rites, in devotees staunchly faithful to Siva and in the festivals of Siva.

41. Let all these curses causing misery, descend on your progeny as well. — and

O 42. All your descendants sons, grandsons others, brahmins, shall be non-Saivites. You shall stay certainly in hell along with your sons.

43. Afterwards you shall be born as Canqlalas harassed by miseries and poverty. You shall be rogues, censuring others and marked with red-hot seals.

Suta said:

44. After cursing the sages, Gautama returned to his hermitage. He performed the devotional rites of Siva and became very holy.

45. Then the brahmins and sages distressed by the curses of Gautama put up their residence in K5fici. 161 They were excluded from the rites of Siva.

Suta said:

1. Ravana the arrogant and prestige-minded leader of Rak§asas propitiated Siva with devotion on the excellent mountain Kailasa.

2. Though the worship continued for a long time, Siva was not delighted. Then Ravana performed another penance to delight Siva.

3-4. The glorious Ravana, scion of the family of Pulastya dug a deep ditch among the groves of trees on the southern side of Himavat, the mountain that is usually the spot of Siddhi. O brahmins, he then kindled fire within it. Near it he installed the idol of Siva and performed a sacrifice.

5. He performed three types of penance. During the summer he stationed himself in the midst of five fires, during chi-pu-lo (Kiftclpura) of the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Thsang. The city was divided in two parts; Vi?nu Ktflci and Rudra KSficf. It is the former that is referred to here.

rainy days he lay on the bare ground and in the winter he stood within water and performed his penance*

6. Thus he performed penance a great deal. Even then Siva the supreme soul, difficult to be propitiated by the wicked was not delighted.

7. Then the ambitious Ravana, lord of Daityas, began to worship Siva by cutting off his heads.

8-9. In the due performance of the worship he cut off his heads one by one. Thus when he had cut off his nine heads and one head remained, the delighted Siva favourably disposed towards his devotees, appeared in front of him.

10. The lord reinstated the severed heads without causing pain and conferred on him his desire as well as unequalled excellent strength.

11. Securing his favour, the Raksasa Ravana replied to Siva, with palms joined in reverence and shoulders drooping down.

Ravana said:

12. O lord of gods, be pleased. I am taking your image to Lanka. 162 Please make my desire fruitful. I seek refuge in you.

Siva said:

13. Thus addressed by Ravana, Siva was in a dilemma and a bit disinclined. He replied.

14. O excellent Raksasa, hear. My words are significant. Let my excellent phallic image be taken to your abode.

15. Wherever this phallic image is placed on the ground it will become stationary. There is no doubt about it. Do as you please.

Sita said:

16. Thus warned by Siva, Ravana, the king of Rak^asas, took it saying “So be it” and went to his abode.

Thanks to Siva’s Maya, he became desirous of passing urine while yet on his way. Lord Ravana of the family of Pulastya could not stop this urge.

# 18.

He saw a cowherd there and requested him to hold the image. About an hour elapsed, when Ravana did not return, the cowherd became nervous.

# 19-21.

He was distressed by its heavy weight. He placed it on the ground. The phallic image made of the essence of diamond remained fixed there. O sage, that phallic image is known as Vaidyanathe£vara. It yields all desires and dispels sins at its very sight. It is famous in the three worlds. It grants worldly pleasures here and salvation hereafter.

This Jyotirlinga is the most excellent of all. By its sight or worship it destroys sins. It is divine and conducive to salvation.

# 22.

It stood there for the benefit of the worlds. Ravana returned to his abode after securing the blissful boon.

# 23.

On hearing of it Indra and other gods and the pious sages with minds fixed in Siva consulted one another.

# 24.

O sage, Vi$nu, Brahma and other gods arrived at the spot and devotedly performed the worship of Siva.

# 25.

The gods saw the deity personally and after consecrating the image they called Vaidyanatha. They then bowed to the image and eulogised it. Then they returned to heaven.

# The sages said:

# 26.

O dear, when the image was installed and Ravana had returned to his abode, what happened? Please narrate it in detail.

# Suta said:

# 27.

After securing the great and excellent boon, the great Asura Ravana returned to his abode and mentioned everything to his beloved wife. He rejoiced much.

# 28.

O great sages, on hearing everything Indra and other gods and sages too became extremely dejected. They spoke to one another.

The gods and sages said:

1. “Ravana is a wicked knave. He is evil-minded and hater of the gods. After securing the boon from Siva, he will make us more miserable.
2. What shall we do? Where shall we go? What will happen now? What evil deeds this wicked fellow will not do after becoming more efficient?”
3. Thus distressed, Indra and other gods, and the sages too invited Narada and asked him dejectedly. The gods said:
4. O excellent sage, you can do everything. O celestial sage, find out some means to dispel the grief of the gods.
5. What evil deeds the extremely wicked Ravana will not do? Where shall we go, being harassed by the wicked fellow?

Narada said:

O gods, give up your sorrow. I shall plan out and go. By the mercy of Siva, I shall carry out the task of the gods.

Suta said:

Thus saying, the celestial sage went to Ravana’s abode. After receiving the formal welcome he spoke with great pleasure.

JVdrada said:

“O excellent Raksasa, you are a blessed sage, a great devotee of Siva. At your sight today my mind is much delighted.
Please narrate the details how you propitiate Siva.” Thus asked by him Ravana replied.

Rdvana said:

O great sage, after going to Kailasa for penance, I performed a severe penance for a long time.
O sage, when Siva was not pleased, I returned from there to the grove and resumed penance.

---


40. Standing in the midst of five fires during the summer, lying on the bare ground during rains and staying inside water during the winter I performed three-fold penance. O great sage thus I performed a severe penance there. Still Siva was not even slightly pleased with me.

41-43. I then became angry. I dug a ditch in the ground and kindled fire. I made earthen idols. By waving lights in the course of worship I worshipped Siva with scents, sandal paste, incense and food-offerings.

44. Siva was propitiated by me by obeisances, eulogies, songs, dances, musical instruments and mystic gestures of faces and fingers.

45. By such different modes and various other means lord Siva was worshipped by me according to the rules laid down in the Sastras.

46. When lord Siva was not pleased and did not appear in my presence I was distressed as I could not obtain the fruits of penance.

47. “Fie upon my body. Fie upon my strength. Fie upon my penance.” Saying this I performed several sacrifices in the fire that had been kept there.

48-49. Then I thought “I will cast off my body into the fire”. Thereafter I cut off my heads one by one, purified them and offered them to the fire. Thus nine heads were offered by me.

50. O excellent sage, when I was about to cut off my tenth head, Siva appeared before me as a mass of splendour.

51. The lord favourably disposed towards his devotees immediately spoke to me, “I am delighted. Mention the boon you wish to have. I shall grant you what you desire in your mind.”

52. When lord Siva said this I eulogised and bowed to him with palms joined in great devotion.

53. Then I requested the lord, “O lord of gods, if you are pleased nothing will be inaccessible to me? Please give me unequalled strength.”

54. All that I had desired in my mind was granted by the merciful and satisfied Siva, saying the words “So be it.”

55. Reinstating my heads like a physician they were glanced at by Siva, the supreme soul with unfailing benign look.

56. When this was done, my body regained its former state. Thanks to his grace, all benefits were derived by me.

57. Then, requested by me, Siva stayed there permanently in the name of VaidyanatheSvara. He has now become famous in the three worlds.

58. Lord Siva in the form of Jyotirlinga confers worldly pleasures and salvation by his sight and worship. He is the benefactor of all in the world.

59. I particularly worshipped that Jyotirlinga and bowed to it. I have returned home and intend to conquer the three worlds.

Suta said:

60. The celestial sage was excited on hearing his words. Laughing within himself, Narada spoke to Ravana.

Narada said:

61. May this be heard, O excellent Rak$asa, I shall tell you what is beneficial to you. You shall do as I say and not otherwise at any cost.

62. What you said just now that everything was granted by Siva should never be taken for granted.

63. What will he not say in his state of mental aberration? It will never come out to be true. How can it be proved? You are my favourite.

64. Hence you shall go again and do this for your own benefit. You shall endeavour to lift up Kailasa.

65. Everything will come out to be fruitful only when Kailasa is lifted up. It is doubtlessly so.

66. You replace it as before and return happily. Decide ultimately and do as you wish.

Siva said:

67. Ravana, deluded by fate, considered it beneficial when thus advised. Believing in the advice of the sage he went to Kailasa.

68. Reaching there he lifted up the mountain. Every*

thing on the mountain became topsyturvy and mixed up with one another.

# 69.

On seeing it, Siva said “What has happened?” Siva laughed and replied.

# Siva said:

# 70.

You have got the return of favouring your disciple, indeed. Something good has happened through this disciple, now that an unequalled strength has been bestowed on a quiet soul who is a great hero.

# Suta said:

# 71.

On hearing the words of Siva with a veiled hint, lord Siva considered Ravana ungrateful. He cursed him for being arrogant of his strength.

# Lord Siva said:

# 72.

O Ravana, A base devotee, wicked-minded, do not be arrogant. destroyer of the arrogance of your mighty hands will come soon.

# Suta said:

# 73.

What thus happened there Narada too heard. Ravana delighted in his mind returned to his abode.

# 74.

Coming to a firm decision, the mighty Ravana, deluded of his own strength, destroyed the arrogance of his enemies and brought the whole universe under his control.

# 75.

Due to the divine weapons and great strength secured at the behest of Siva, there was none to counter-challenge Ravana in fight.

# 76.

By listening to this glory of lord Vaidyanatha the sinners get their sins reduced to ashes.

# CHAPTER TWENTYNINE

# (The havoc of the Rdk$asas of Ddrukavana)

Suta said:

1. Hereafter I shall explain how the extremely excellent Jyotirlinga Nage^a of the supreme soul came into being.
2. There was a certain ogress Daruka who became arrogant by the boon granted by Parvati. Her husband Daruka was also very powerful.
3. Along with many Raksasas he tormented the good. He destroyed their sacrifices and spoiled their rites.
4. His fertile and flourishing forest was on the shores of the Western ocean. It extended to sixteen Yojanas in every direction.
5. Wherever Daruka went in that forest for her sportive pleasure, the land in that spot acquired all requisites and became full of trees.
6. The goddess had entrusted Daruka with the supervision of that forest. She casually visited that forest along with her consort.
7. Staying there, the Raksasa Daruka and his wife Daruka terrorised the people.
8. The harassed people sought refuge in Aurva. They paid homage to him with reverence and with their head bent down with pleasure they requested him thus.

The people said:

O great sage, grant us shelter, if not, we will be killed by the wicked Daruka. You are competent to do everything. You are brilliant with your splendour.

Footnotes:

1. The Western ocean referred to in the Puranas is identical with the Arabian sea.
2. Darukavana which contains the temple of Nagesa, one of the twelve great jyotirlingas of Mahadeva is placed close to the western ocean. The content mentions the background for its nomenclature. Contrary to this statement, the Arch. Sur. lists of Nizam’s territory (XXXI. 21. 2&#x3C;)) identify it with Auudii in the Nizam’s territory. There are two more forests of this name: one in the Himalayas, near Badrinath, the other Vijayesvara in Kashmir. Darukavana, with reference to the demoness Daruka, should not be confused with other Daruka forests.
3. The sage Aurva was the son of (Jrva and grandson of the famous sage Bhfgu.

10. There is none in the world except you in whom we can seek refuge and staying near whom we can be happy.

11. On seeing you, the Raksasas run off. The splendour of Siva always shines in you like fire.

Sula said:

12. Thus requested by the people the excellent sage Aurva, worthy of being resorted to, bewailed their lot and spoke these words for their protection.

Aurva said:

13. If the Raksasas torture living beings on the earth they will die themselves although they are very powerful.

14. Whenever the people are killed, let the Raksasas too die. This is the truth I say.

Sula said:

15. After promising to the subjects and consoling them, Aurva continued different types of penance, conferring happiness on the people.

16. Realising the cause for the curse, the gods made attempts to fight with the demons.

17. With multifarious efforts and holding all types of weapons Indra and the other gods arrived there for the battle.

18. On seeing them the Raksasas began to ponder. They consulted with one another.

Raksasas said:

19. “What shall be done? Where shall we go? A difficult situation has come up. We are fighting and dying. They are fighting but they are not killed.

20. If this situation continues what shall happen to us? A great misery has befallen us. Who can ward this off?”

Sula said:

21. Thinking thus and unable to find out a remedy Daruka and his companions felt miserable indeed.

22. On knowing that a great calamity had arrived, the demoness Daruka spoke of the boon granted by Parvati.

Ddrukd said:

23. Propitiated by me formerly, the wife of Siva had granted me a boon. You can go to the forest along with your people if you desire to go.

24. That boon has been secured by me. How is this misery to be borne? Taking your people to the island you can stay with the Raksasas happily.

Suta said:

25. On hearing the words of the Raksasi, the Raksasas were delighted. Getting rid of their fear they spoke to one another.

26. “She is blessed. She is fortunate. We have been saved by her.” After bowing to her they said respectfully.

O 27. “If we can go let us go. Why ponder over it? Gentle lady, we shall go and stay there permanently in the waters.”

28. In the meantime the people who had been tortured by the Raksasas formerly came there for fighting, accompanied by the gods.

29-31. In their dilemma the Raksasas resorted to the boon granted by Parvati. They took their belongings to the city in the ocean. The demoness shouted cries of victory to the goddess and flew like the winged king of mountains. She then stayed fearlessly in the middle of the ocean. The follower of Siva accompanied by her attendants rejoiced much.

32. Staying in the city inside the ocean, the sportive Raksasas became happy and fearless.

33. For fear of the sage’s curse, Raksasas did not come on the earth. They moved about in the waters.

34. They abducted travellers in the boats and imprisoned them in the city. They killed some of them.

167. According to the Puranic tradition mountains had wings, flew at will and destroyed those towns and villages which refused them. Thus they proved refractory and troublesome to the people. Thereupon Indra clipped off their wings and made them stationary.

# 35.

Staying there fearlessly, thanks to the boon granted by Parvati, the Raksasas worked havoc as before.

# 36.

O great sages, the people had the terror in the waters now incessantly in the manner they had fear on land before.

# 37.

Sometimes the Rak$asi came out of the city in the water and blocked the path to the land in order to harass the people.

# 38.

In the meantime several beautiful boats arrived there all full of people.

# 39.

On seeing those boats the wicked Raksasas were delighted much. Rushing at the people on board they bound them forcefully.

# 40.

The naughty Raksasas came to the city taking those people with them. They fettered them and put them in prisons.

# 41.

The people thus bound in fetters and imprisoned became very unhappy. They were rebuked again and again.

# 42.

Their leader was a certain Vai$ya named Supriya. His conduct was auspicious and pleasing to Siva. He was a permanent devotee of Siva.

# 43.

He never remained without the worship of Siva. In every respect he followed the sacred rites of Siva. Bhasma and Rudraksa were his ornaments.

# 44.

If on any day he could not worship Siva he did not take his food. The VaiSya performed the worship of Siva there in the prison also.

# 45.

O excellent sages, he taught the mantra of Siva and the mode of worshipping the earthen phallic image to several of his fellow-prisoners.

# 46.

They performed there the worship of Siva duly in the manner they saw and heard. It yielded them their desires.

# 47.

Some of them stayed in meditation taking up excellent postures. Some of them joyously performed the mental worship of Siva.

# 48.

O great sages, the direct worship of Siva was performed by the leader then in accordance with the rites of worshipping the earthen phallic image.

49. Those who did not know the great rite remained meditating on Siva with the five-syllabled mantra “Namah Sivaya.

50. The leading Vaisya Supriya, a favourite of Siva, performed the worship of Siva by mental meditation.

51. Siva in the form mentioned before took up everything directly. The Vaisya was aware that his offerings were taken by Siva.

52. O great sages, even as the Vaisya continued to perform the worship of Siva, six months passed by without hindrance.

1. Once an attendant of the wicked Raksasa saw the beautiful form of Siva in front of him.

2. That wonderful incident was truthfully intimated to the king of Raksasas.

3. The king of the Raksasas, Daruka, though very powerful was excited much. He hastened to the Vaisya and asked him.

Raksasa was angry. He incited the Raksasas—:cO Raksasas, let him be killed.

Urged by him, they seized various weapons and rushed at the leading Vaisya whose mind was attached to Siva, with desire to kill him.

On seeing them come, the Vaisya remembered Siva with devotion and repealed his names though his eyes indicated that he was extremely frightened.

The leading Vaisya said:

O Siva, save me. O lord of gods, save me. O Siva, save me now from this wicked Raksasa. O lord of the three worlds, slayer of the wicked, O one favourably disposed towards his devotees.

O lord, you alone are my entire possession. I belong to you. I am subservient to you. O lord, my very life is always in you.

Sfita said:

Thus implored, Siva appeared out of the crevice with an excellent temple with four doors.

Seeing in its midst the wonderfully brilliant form of Siva along with his attendants he worshipped him.

On being worshipped, Siva became delighted. He gave him the Pu<upata missile.="" he="" immediately="" slew="" all="" the="" raksasas="" with="" their="" attendants="" and="" adjuncts.="" saved="" thus="" his="" devotee.="" indeed="" siva="" is="" slayer="" of="" wicked.&#x3C;="" p="">

After killing all of them, Siva the creator of his Oracles and who assumes bodies in the course of sports granted a boon to the forest.

May the rites and activities of the four castes, Brahmins, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras flourish in this forest always.

Let there never be people of the Tamasaic qualities. Let there be excellent sages, the propounders and the followers of the Saiva cult.

In the meantime the Raksasi Daruka dejected in her mind, eulogised Parvati.

18. The goddess being pleased said “What shall I do?” She replied -“Let my race be protected by you.”

19. “I shall protect your race. I say this truth to you.” Saying this the Goddess quai relied with Siva.

20. On seeing the goddess furious, the lord, bound by the boon granted by him, replied with pleasure. “Do as you please.”

21. On hearing the words of her husband Siva, the delighted Parvati laughed and spoke these words.

Pdrvatf said:

22. “Your words will be true at the end of this Yuga. Till then, I think, there can be the Tamasaic creations as well.

23. Otherwise the dissolution will take place even now. O Siva, let the words uttered by me be proved true. O lord, I belong to you. I depend on you.

24. This Riiksasl Daruka is my own Sakti. She is the most powerful among the Raksasls. Let her rule over the kingdom of the Raksasas.

25. These wives of the Raksasas will give birth to sons. I have permitted all of them to live jointly in the forest.

Suta said:

26. On hearing these words of Parvati, lord Siva was delighted in his mind and spoke these words.

Siva said: —O beloved, you say so, please listen to my words.

27. I will stay in this forest with pleasure for protecting the devotees.

28. He who maintains the discipline of rites and activities prescribed for different castes and has a sight of me with pleasure here will become an emperor.

29-30. Or, at the end of the recurring cycle of Kali or in the beginning of Kfta Age, the leading king equipped with a vast army, famous in the name of Virasena son of Mahasena, will have a sight of me. He will be a very

valorous devotee of mine. After viewing me he will become an emperor.

Suta said: Exchanging pleasantries the couple, O brahmins, indulging in great sports remained there.

The Jyotirliriga form of Siva came to be known as Nagesvara. Goddess Siva became Nagesvari. Both of them are favourites of the devotees.

The sages said:

O intelligent one, how will VIrasena go to Daruka vana and worship Siva? Please narrate it.

Suta said:

Virasena, son of ^Aahasena, was a great favourite of Siva. He was born of a Ksatriya family in the beautiful land of Nisadha.

Worshipping the earthen image of the lord, Virasena performed a severe penance, lasting for twelve years.

Then Siva, the delighted lord of the gods, became visible to him and said: —Make a fish-like canoe of wood. Coat it with tin and other metals. O Virasena, I shall create Yogamaya and give it to you. Enter the canoe accompanied by Yogamaya and your men. Proceed to the island in the Western ocean. Enter the crevice made by me. Perform the worship of Nagesvara. Thereafter secure the missile Pasupata and slay the Raksasi and others. When I appear before you; you will not remain deficient in anything.

Parvati’s strength will grow to be complete. The Mlecchas of the forest will become pious and auspicious.

After saying this to Virasena and bestowing his mercy on everyone lord Siva, the destroyer of miseries, vanished there itself.

Having received the boon from Siva the supreme soul, Virasena became competent to do everything, of course.

# (The greatness of RameSvara)

SUta said:

1. Hereafter I shall explain how the phallic image Ramesvara originated formerly. O sages, listen to it respectfully.

2. Formerly, Visnu the favourite of the good, took his incarnation as Rama on the earth.

3. O brahmins, Rama’s wife Sita, the daughter of Janaka, was kidnapped by Ravana the wielder of great Maya and taken to his abode in Lanka.

4. Searching for her, Rama went to the city called Ki?kindha. 171 Having alliance with Sugriva for his benefit he killed Bali.

5. After staying there for sometime, he held consultations with Laksmana, Sugriva and others eager to find her out.

6. The prince Rama sent the monkeys, the chief of whom was Hanumat, to various directions in order to find her out.

7. On getting the crest-jewel of Sita and on knowing from the excellent monkey that she was in Lanka, Rama rejoiced much.

8-9. O brahmins, accompanied by Hanuman the chief of monkeys, Lak?mana, Sugriva and other monkey chiefs of

great might and a vast army of monkeys eighteen thousand billions in number Rama reached the shores of the Southern salt ocean.

10. Reaching there, Rama the favourite of Siva stationed himself on the shore, being served by the monkeys and his brother Laksmana.

11-13. “Alas where has Janakt gone? When will she meet me. The ocean is very deep. The army of the monkeys is to be taken across. The Raksasa of great strength and valour, the uplifter of the mountain Kailasa has resorted to his stronghold Lanka. His son is Indrajit, the conqueror of Tndra. Thus thought Rama in the company of Laksmana standing on the shore itself. He was appeased by Angada and other monkeys.

14. Then Rama the excellent devotee of Siva, desirous of water, lovingly spoke to his brother Laksmana.

Rama said: O brother Laksmana, lord of heroes, am

15. I thirsty. I desire water. You get some water quickly through some monkey.

Suta said:

16. On hearing it the monkeys ran in all directions. They brought water, bowed to Rama and standing before him said.

The monkeys said:

17. O lord, at your behest we have brought excellent water, sweet, cool and refreshing. Please take it.

Suta said:

18. On hearing it Rama was much delighted. With a benign glance at them he accepted the water offered.

19. When Rama, the devotee of Siva, took the water and was about to drink it, it occurred to him at the will of Siva.

20. “I have not yet had the sight of Siva, the great lord, the bestower of all bliss. How can the water be taken in?

After saying this, he drank water and then performed the worship of Siva’s earthen image.

# 22.

He worshipped Siva performing all the sixteen ancillary services like invocation etc. with devotion according to the rules obtaining.

# 23.

After propitiating him with obeisances, divine eulogies etc. strenuously, Rama joyously prayed to Siva with great devotion.

# Rama said:

# 24.

O lord Siva, O great lord, always favourably disposed towards your devotees, save me your devotee, dejected in the mind and seeking refuge in you.

# 25.

O Bhavatarana (one who takes devotees across the ocean of worldly existence), this ocean is very deep. The Raksasa Ravana is heroic and mighty.

# 26.

The army of monkeys is a very fickle instrument of war. How can my task be achieved resulting in pleasing acquisition. In O lord of good help must be that, rites, rendered to me. O lord, without your help my purpose is difficult to be achieved.

# 27.

Ravana is your devotee. He is invincible in every respect to everyone. He is haughty due to the boons granted by you. He is a great hero who has conquered the three worlds.

# 28.

O Sadasiva, I too am your slave, in every respect subservient to you. Considering this, you shall be partial to me.

After praying and bowing to the lord again and again, he repeated loudly, “O Siva, be victorious, be victorious” and eulogised Siva. Repeating the mantras and meditating, he performed the worship again and danced before the lord.

# 32.

With the heart drenched with devotional love he produced the throat-sound. Lord Siva was much delighted.

Assuming the pure form as mentioned and

Accompanied by all his attendants, lord Siva of brilliant form appeared before him immediately.

# 34.

Then, satisfied in heart with Rama’s devotion, his lord Siva said, “Rama, may there be welfare to you. Mention the boon you wish to have.”

# 35.

On seeing that form, they became sanctified. Rama himself, interested in Saiva cult, performed the worship.

# 36.

Eulogising in diverse ways and bowing to Siva joyously, he requested for his victory in the imminent fight with Ravana.

# 37.

Delighted in his heart at Ram’s devotion, lord Siva said lovingly, “O great king, may you be victorious.”

# 38.

Securing the blessing of victory granted by Siva and receiving the permission of the lord, he prayed again with palms joined in reverence and head bent down.

Rama said:

# 39.

“O Siva, if you are pleased, you shall stay here, lord, to sanctify the worlds and to render help to the people.”

Suta said:

# 40.

Thus implored, Siva took up the phallic image named RameSvara. It is now famous on the surface of the world.

# 41.

It was by Siva’s favour that Rama crossed the ocean soon, killed Ravana and other Rak$asas and regained his beloved.

# 42.

The greatness of RameSvara became wonderful and unequalled in the world. It yields worldly pleasures and salvation and bestows all desires on the devotees always.

# 43.

He who performs the ablution of Siva with the waters of the divine Ganga and worships Ramesvara with great devotion becomes a living liberated soul indeed.

# 44.

After enjoying all pleasures here, rare even to the gods and deriving perfect knowledge in the end, he will certainly attain salvation.

Thus has been narrated the story of RameSvara, the Jyotirlinga of Siva. It is divine. It destroys the sins of the devotees who listen to it.

2. There is the excellent mountain in the Southern region named Deva. It shines with great splendour and is very wonderful to view.
3. A certain brahmin Sudharma who was the most excellent among the knowers of Brahman and who was born of Bharadvaja family lived near it.
4. His beloved wife Sudeha was interested in Saiva cult and sacred rites. She was skilful in all household activities and she devoutly served her husband.
5. The excellent brahmin Sudharma worshipped gods and guests. He was devotedly attached to the Vedic path and scrupulously maintained the sacrificial fires.
6. He had the brilliance of the Sun. He performed Sandhya prayers thrice a day. He taught disciples and was an expert in the Vedas and Sastras both.
7. He was affluent and had also the qualities of gentlemanliness. He was a liberal donor, a devotee of Siva, a favourite of his followers and he engaged himself in the sacred rites of Siva-cult.
8. A long period in his life thus passed when he continued his religious rites but no son was born to him. His wife’s menstrual periods were fruitless. She did not conceive.
9. He did not grieve over this because he realised the reality of different things. He knew that the soul is the uplifter of the soul and the soul is the sanctifier of the soul.
10. Thinking thus he did not feel aggrieved even mentally. But Sudeha was distressed for not having a son.
11. Everyday she implored her learned husband to strive for the acquisition of a son.

Know this particularly with a keen intellect. Do not be aggrieved. O gentle lady, misery shall be eschewed by you, certainly. One of auspicious rites, you shall not pester me like this everyday.” After enlightening her, he became interested in the worship of the lord. He was perfectly contented. He did not feel the misery or joy of mutually contrary interests.

17. She was reproached by the neighbour’s wife as natural to women. Sudeha was aggrieved with her harsh words. The neighbourly woman said:

18. O sonless woman, why are you arrogant? I have a son who will inherit my wealth. But there is none to inherit your property.

19. Undoubtedly the king will confiscate your estate. Barren woman, fie upon you, upon your wealth, upon your honour and prestige.

Suta said:

20. Thus reproached by her she returned home depressed. She narrated to her husband all what her neighbour had said to her.

21. The intelligent brahmin was not grieved by hearing it. He said “Let her say what she wishes, O beloved, what is destined to happen will happen.”

22. Thus pacified and consoled again and again by her husband she did not stop worrying. She again pleaded.

Sudeha said:

23. O You are my husband. Somehow you shall beget a son, excellent among men, otherwise I shall cast off this body.

24. On hearing what she said, Sudharma the excellent brahmin, harassed by her importunities, mentally remembered Siva.

25. The alert brahmin offered two flowers to the sacrificial fire. He thought in his mind that the right side flower would yield a son.

26. Making this as a condition the brahmin told his wife, “You shall take one of these two flowers to decide about the acquisition of a son.”

27-28. She thought, “I will surely have a son. Let the insignia flower come to me.” Then she bowed to Siva and the sacrificial fire. After praying again she picked up one of the flowers.

29. The insignia flower was missed by her due to delusion caused by Siva’s desire.

30. On seeing it the husband sighed deeply. Remembering the lotus-like feet of Siva he spoke to his beloved.

# Sudharma said:

31. O beloved, how can what is ordained by the lord be otherwise? Cast off your vain hopes. Render service to the lord.

32. After saying so and giving up hope himself, the brahmin became engaged in sacred rites and meditation on Siva.

33. Yearning for a son Sudeha did not leave off her pleadings. With palms joined in reverence and bending her head she lovingly said to her husband.

# Sudeha said:

34. Let there be no son born of me. With my consent you shall take another wife. Undoubtedly she will bear you a son.

35. Requested thus by his beloved wife, that brahmin the most excellent of the devotees of Siva and fond of sacred rites spoke to her.

Sudharma said:

36. Our miseries have gone off, O beloved, do not put obstacles in our holy rites now.

Suta said:

37. Although prevented thus, she brought her mother’s younger daughter to her house and said to her husband “Take her.”

Sudharma said:

38. Now you say that she must be my beloved wife. But should she give birth to a son you will begin to be jealous of her.

Suta said:

39. O brahmins, when thus warned by her husband, Sudeha joined her palms in reverence and spoke to him,

40. “O excellent brahmin, I will not be jealous of my own sister. Please marry her and beget a son. I urge upon you.”

41. Thus implored by her, Sudharma married that lady Ghusma with due ceremonies.

42. After marrying her he requested Sudeha, “O my pious beloved, this is your younger sister. You must bring her up.”

43. After saying this, Sudharma, the most excellent devotee of Siva, pursued his sacred rites to the utmost with his mind leaning towards virtue.

44. Sudeha served her sister like a hired wench eschewing all opposition and lovingly nurtured her.

45. The junior wife with the consent of her sister, made hundred and one earthen idols every day.

46. According to the sacred rules Ghusma rendered devotional services to these images and threw them in the neighbouring lake.

47. Thus she performed the wish-yielding worship of Siva every day leaving them off and invoking them again in accordance with the rules of devotional service.

48. Performing the worship of Siva thus regularly

49. By the mercy of Siva a son was born to her. He was beautiful, fortunate and endowed with all auspicious qualities.

50. On seeing him the brahmin was much delighted. Being the most excellent of all who knew virtue and engrossed in the virtues of knowledge he enjoyed the pleasure with due detachment.

51. Then Sudeha grew fiercely jealous of her. Her heart which was cool and quiet before began to blaze like fire now. O great may the despicable event

# CHAPTER THIRTYTHREE

# ( Origin and glory of the Jyotirlinga Ghuimesvara )

Suta said :

1. On seeing the son of the younger sister, the elder sister was much distressed. Unable to see her pleasure she became inimical.

2. Her people celebrated the birth of a son continually. But she could not bear the sight of the beautiful child.

3. On seeing the son, a great favourite of the parents and endowed with all good qualities, her heart began to blaze like fire.

4. In the meantime many brahmins came there offering their daughters in marriage. Sudharma celebrated the marriage of his son duly.

5. Sudharma was extremely delighted in the company of Ghusma. All the relatives honoured GhuSma much.

6. On seeing that, Sudeha blazed furiously in her mind. Extremely distressed she began to lament, '0 I am doomed.

7. When the daughter-in-law came to the house and

the son was duly married, Sudharma evinced his enthusiasm to both the wives with an intention of delighting them equally.

8. But Ghusma was delighted and Sudeha was distressed. Unable to bear her happiness, she fell on the ground. Ghusma said:

9. “These are your own son and daughter-in-law not mine.” But the daughter-in-law considered Sudeha her mother-in-law and the son considered her his mother.

10. The husband too loved the elder more than he loved the younger. Still the elder wife retained dirt in her mind.

11. One day the senior wife Sudeha, extremely distressed in her heart, thought how she could subdue her misery. Sudeha said:

12. “Certainly the fire in my heart can be tranquilized only through the tears of Ghusma caused by her misery and not otherwise.

13. So I shall kill her son today, the son that speaks pleasing words to her. What is destined to happen shall happen. This is my final decision.

SUta said:

14. O brahmins, the inimical nature among co-wives is extremely ruthless and suicidal. The wicked and the mean do not ponder what shall be done or not done.

15. One day during the night as the son was sleeping with his wife she took a big knife and cut off his limbs.

16-17. The senior wife cut off the limbs of Ghusma’s son at night. Strong that she was she took them to the lake where the earthen images of Siva were usually hurled by Ghusma. After casting off the limbs into the lake she returned and slept.

18. In the morning Ghusma got up and performed her daily household duties. Sudharma too performed his daily sacred rites.

19. In the meantime the senior wife too got up and performed her duties with great pleasure, now that the fire in her heart had been tranquillised.

20. Getting up in the morning, the daughter-in-law saw to her horror the bed wet with blood and a few scattered pieces of the body.

21. She told her mother-in-law, “where has your son gone? The bed is wet with blood. Pieces of the body are also seen.”

22. The daughter-in-law fond of her husband began to lament—“O I am doomed. O my mother of holy rites, who has perpetrated this wicked deed?”

23. The senior wife, though delighted inwardly, showed great distress outwardly saying “O I am doomed!”

24. Ghusma heard the pitiable lamentation of her daughter-in-law but did not leave off her sacred rite, the daily worship of Siva’s earthen image.

25. Her mind did not exhibit any agitation. The husband too remained calm till the completion of the sacred rite.

26. At noon when the worship was concluded she looked at the terrible bed. Still Ghusma did not show signs of grief.

27-29. “He who has given this boy will protect him too. The annihilator of Kala, the goal of the good, is famous as a favourite of his devotee. Our protector, the sole lord, Siva is like a gardener. He separates those whom he has united. What can I gain by worrying over it?” Realising this truth, being emboldened in dedicating herself to Siva she did not grieve much.

30. Taking the day’s earthly phallic images she went towards the bank of the lake repeating the names of Siva, maintaining the normalcy of her mind as afore.

31. When she cast off the earthen phallic images and returned she saw her son standing on the bank of the lake. The son said:

32. I shall meet my mother. After dying I have been

Resuscitated, thanks to the power of her virtue and the mercy of Siva.

Suta said: O brahmins, on seeing her son restored to life the mother was not delighted as she was not distressed before.

At that time, lord Siva appeared before her immediately in the form of a mass of splendour. He said delightedly.

Siva said: O excellent-faced lady, I am delighted. Mention the boon you wish to have. This boy had been killed by that wicked lady. I shall kill her with my trident.

Suta said: Bowing down to Siva she requested for the boon “O lord, Sudcha, my sister, must be protected by you.”

Siva said: Harm has been done by her. Why should you render help to her? Sudcha the perpetrator of wicked deeds must be killed.

Ghusma said: No sin stays, the moment you are seen. Now, on seeing you her sin will be reduced to ashes.

‘Sin is far removed at the mere sight of the person who renders help to those who harm him.

These wonderful words of the lord have been heard by me O lord. Hence, O Sadasiva let it not be done otherwise.

Suta said: Thus requested by her, lord Siva the ocean of mercy, favourably disposed towards his devotees was delighted and spoke thus.

Siva said: O Ghusma, request for another boon. I shall grant you what is beneficial to you. I am delighted at your devotion and your nature of being free from aberrations.

1. She said after hearing his words “If a boon is to be given by you, you shall stay here in my name for protecting the worlds.”
2. Then the delighted lord Siva said “I shall stay here in your name. I shall be named Ghu£mesa and I shall confer happiness.
3. May my phallic image named Ghusmeia be auspicious and famous. Let this lake be the storehouse of phallic images always.
4. Hence it will be famous in the three worlds in the name of “Sivalaya.” This lake shall always yield desires by its mere sight.
5. O lady of good rites, upto a hundred and one generations in your family sons of great excellence like this will be born undoubtedly.
6. They will have good wives, plenty of wealth, longevity and skill in everything. They will be learned and liberal. They will attain worldly pleasures and salvation.
7. They will be hundred and one endowed with many qualities. Your family will expand like this splendidly.

# Suta said:

After saying this Siva assumed the form of a phallic image named GhuSmesa. He became famous. The lake was called Sivalaya.
Sudharma, Ghusma and Sudeha came there and circumambulated Siva hundred and one times.
After performing the worship of lord Siva, fondly meeting one another and eschewing the dirt of the mind they attained great happiness.
On seeing the son regained to life, Sudeha was ashamed. O brahmins, she performed the expiatory rite for her sins and requested for forgiveness.

274. Sivltlaya lake, the abode of Ghusmesvara phallic image is placed near Devagiri in the Aurangabad district of the erstwhile Hyderabad State.

O great sages, the phallic image named GhusmeSa originated thus. Its very sight and worship renders happiness always.

Thus I have narrated to you the twelve Jyotir-lingas which yield all desires, worldly pleasures and salvation.

He who reads or listens to this narrative of Jyotir-lingas gets rid of sins and attains worldly pleasures and salvation.

Vydsa said:

O great sages, on hearing the words of Suta the sages praised him and spoke desiring the welfare of the worlds.

The sages said:

O Suta, you know everything. Hence we ask you, holy lord, please narrate the greatness of the phallic image Harisvara.

O dear, this was heard by us formerly that by propitiating Harisvara, Vi$nu acquired his discus Sudariana. Please narrate that story particularly.

Suta said: O great sages, may the auspicious story of Harisvara be heard, how Sudariana was acquired by Vi$nu formerly from Siva.

On a certain occasion the Daityas became very powerful. They harassed the worlds and violated sacred rites.

Tormented by the Daityas of great strength and exploit, the gods narrated their misery to Vi$nu, their saviour.

The gods said:

7. O lord, be merciful. We are very much afflicted by the Daityas. Where shall we go? What shall we do? We have resorted to you, for you are worthy of seeking refuge by us.

Suta said:

8. On hearing these words of the gods distressed in mind, Visnu remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and said.

Visnu said:

9. O gods, I shall carry out your task after propitiating Siva. These powerful enemies shall be conquered with great effort.

Suta said:

10. Thus consoled by lord Visnu, the gods thought that the Daityas would be surely killed. They then went to their respective abodes.

11. For the victory of the gods, Visnu worshipped Siva, the lord of all the gods, the imperishable and the cosmic witness of all.

12. He went to Kailasa and dug a pit there wherein he kindled fire and performed penance.

13. He worshipped Siva joyously with various mantras and hymns prescribed for the worship of earthen image.

14. O great sages, he worshipped with the lotus-flowers growing in the Manasa lake. He sat firmly in the Yogic posture and did not move at all.

15. Thinking decisively— “By all means I shall stay here till the lord is pleased” Visnu worshipped Siva.

16. O brahmins, when Siva was not pleased with Visnu, the latter began to think anxiously.

17. After thinking thus he rendered him various services. Still, lord Siva, indulging in divine sports was not satisfied.

18. Surprised much at this, Visnu, endowed with great devotion, eulogised lord Siva by reciting his thousand names with pleasure.

19. Repeating every name, he worshipped Siva, favourably disposed towards those who seek refuge in him! with a lotus flower.

20. In order to test the piety of Visnu, one of the thousand lotus-flowers was taken away by Siva.

21. That wonderful Maya of Siva was not noticed by Visnu. But when he came to know of the shortage he started to search.

22. In order to find it out he roamed over the world, steadily maintaining his sacred rite. But not finding the same, the pious Visnu offered one of his eyes (instead of the lotus).

23. On seeing it Siva who destroys all miseries was delighted and appeared before him. He spoke these words to Visnu.

Siva said:

24. O Visnu, I am delighted with you. Mention the boon you wish to have. I shall grant you what you desire. There is nothing which cannot be given to you.

Suta said:

25. On hearing the words of Siva, Visnu was pleased in his mind. Extremely delighted he spoke to Siva with palms joined in reverence.

Visnu said:

26. What is there to be mentioned to you? You are the immanent soul. Still, O Lord, I mention the same with due deference to your behest.

27. O SadaSiva, the entire universe is afflicted by the Daityas. We have no pleasure at all. Our weapons are ineffectual in killing the Daityas.

28. What shall I do? Where shall I go? I have no greater saviour than you. O lord, I seek refuge in you.

Suta said:

29. After saying this he stood in affliction and bowed to Siva, the supreme soul.

30. On hearing these words of Visnu, Siva, the lord of gods, gave him his discus Sudarsana shining with the mass of splendour.

31. On receiving it Visnu slew the powerful demons immediately with the discus without any strain.

32. Thereupon the universe derived normalcy, the gods became happy. After receiving the Sudarsana missile Visnu was greatly delighted.

The sages said:

33. What is that hymn of Siva that consists of his thousand names? What is that hymn whereby Siva was so much delighted that he gave Visnu the discus?

34. Please expound the glory of this hymn to us and narrate the dialogue between Siva and Visnu. The merciful nature of Siva towards Visnu may also be narrated to us.

# CHAPTER THIRTYSIX

# (Efficacy of the thousand names of Siva)

SUta said:

1. On hearing the eulogy made by Viṣṇu consisting of the hymn of his thousand divine names lord Siva became delighted.
2. In order to test Viṣṇu, Siva, the lord of the worlds concealed one of the lotus-flowers.
3. There was a shortage of one lotus-flower from among the thousand lotuses. Hence Viṣṇu was distressed in the course of his worship of Siva.
4. He thought within himself "Where could the lotus-flower have gone? If it has gone, let it go for good. Is not my own eye a lotus?"
5. After thinking thus, he plucked out his eye and repeated the last name Sarvasattvavalambana. Full of emotion he worshipped and eulogised Siva.
6. On seeing Viṣṇu in that attitude, Viṣṇu the preceptor of the universe appeared before him and forbade him to do that.
7. Lord Siva descended from the pedestal of that earthen phallic image installed by Viṣṇu.
8. Bowing to Siva, rising up in the form of a mass of splendour as mentioned before, Viṣṇu stood in front of him and eulogised him particularly.
9. Looking mercifully at Viṣṇu, who stood before him with palms joined in reverence, the delighted lord Siva laughingly said then.

Siva said:

O Viṣṇu, all the desires in your mind, particularly the task of the gods have been understood by me. Indeed you are engaged in the task of the gods.

In the list of one thousand names of Siva, this name stands at the end. There being no lotus left for the propitiation of Siva in this name (one lotus having been concealed by lord Siva himself for the test) Viṣṇu plucked off his own eye and offered the same to Siva.

SQta said:

15. After saying this, the lord gave the discus of the brilliance of ten thousand suns, born of his own feet and destructive of all enemies, to Vi?nu.

16. Vi§nu purified himself and accepted it facing the north. After making obeisance to lord Siva, Vi$nu spoke these words to him.

Vifnu said: O lord, O benefactor of the worlds, listen. Please

17. tell me what I shall meditate upon and what I shall recite for the destruction of the distress.

S&#x26;ta said:

18. On being thus asked by him, Siva becoming satisfied and delighted in his mind spoke to Vi?nu who helped the gods.

Siva said: O Visnu, my form that to be meditated

19. upon for subduing all mishaps. Recite my thousand names for destroying the distress that troubles you.

# CHAPTER THIRTYEIGHT

# (The greatness of Sivardtri)

The sages said:

1. O dear, you are blessed and contented. Your life is fruitful since you narrate to us the auspicious narrative of lord Siva.
2. O Suta, although this matter has been heard from many sages, our doubt is not set at rest. Hence we ask you.
3. By what sacred rite is Siva satisfied? By what sacred rite does he impart happiness to the good? You are expert in the knowledge of Siva’s legends and so we ask you.
4. O disciple of Vyasa, obeisance be to you. Please explain clearly the rite by which the devotee can secure both worldly pleasures and salvation.

Suta said:

O great sages, the question is well put by you. There is sympathy brimming in your hearts. After remembering the lotus-like feet of Siva I shall mention it in the manner I have heard.
The same question had been put by Brahma, Vishnu and Siva before Siva in the manner in which you are asking me now.
On a certain occasion they asked Siva, the great soul, “What rite satisfies you to bestow worldly pleasures and salvation?”
When he was asked thus, Siva replied thus. I shall mention it now. It quells the sins of those who listen to it.

Siva said:

There are many rites yielding worldly pleasures and salvation. The most important among them are ten in number.
Those who have mastered the text “Jabalasruti” have mentioned ten sacred rites of Siva. These rites shall

# (The glory of Sivardtri)

The sages said:

1. O Siita, we are extremely delighted on hearing your words. Please narrate the excellent Vrata in detail.

3. May this be heard, sages. I shall narrate the ancient story of the hunter194 which destroys all sins.

4. Formerly there was a hunter in a forest, Gurudruha by name. He had a large family. He was strong, ruthless and engaged in cruel activities.

5. Everyday he used to go to the forest incessantly and kill deer. There in the forest he committed thefts also in various ways.

6. No auspicious action was performed by him from childhood onwards. Thus the wicked fellow passed a long time in the forest.

194. The story of the cruel hunter and his change of heart for the better is found with minor variations in details in the Padmapuifipa also.

1432 Sioapuritfa

1. Once it was a Sivaratri day. But the wicked hunter, staying in the great forest did not know that.
2. On this occasion he was requested by his parents and wife who were oppressed by starvation, “O forest-roamer give us food.”
3. Thus requested he took up his bow and started immediately for hunting deer. He roamed here and there in the forest.
4. Due to adverse fate no game was secured by him. The sun too had set and he was greatly distressed.
5. “What shall I do? Where shall I go? Nothing has been obtained by me. What will happen to my parents and my children at home? Then there is my wife too. What will happen to her? I must go home only with something in my hand. It is impossible to face them empty-handed.”
6. Thinking thus, the hunter went near a pond. He stood near the path leading to water.
7. “Some animal is sure to come here. I shall kill it and go home with pleasure. My purpose will be served fully.
8. Thinking thus the hunter climbed up a Bilva tree, taking some water with him. He sat on its branch.
9. With hunger and thirst oppressing him he waited and thought. “When will some animal come here? When shall I kill it?”
10. During the first part of the night a thirsty hind came there springing and jumping timidly.
11. On seeing it he was much delighted. He fixed an arrow to his bow immediately in order to kill it.
12. When he did this, some water (that he had with him) got spilt and a few leaves of the Bilva tree fell down. There was a phallic idol of Siva beneath the tree. Hence this became his worship for the first part of the night. As a result of this his sin was dissolved.
13. On hearing the noise, the hind became frightened. It was much distressed on seeing the hunter. It spoke thus. The hind said:
14. “O hunter, what is it that you propose to do?



---

FCofirudrasarhhitd 1433

Please speak truth before me” On hearing the words of the hind, the hunter said.

The hunter said:

23-24. “My family is starving today. I shall satisfy their hunger by killing you.” On hearing these terrible words and seeing that ruthless knave, the hind thought “What shall I do? Where shall I go? Well, I shall use a trick,” thinking thus the hind spoke.

The Hind said:

25. There is no doubt that I am blessed. You will be happy with my flesh. What greater merit can I have through this body which is in every respect harmful?

26. It is impossible to expatiate on the merit of a person who helps others even if we take a hundred years.

27. But all my infant fawns are in the hermitage. I shall intrust them to the care of my sister or husband and return.

28. O forest-roamer, do not take my words to be lies. Undoubtedly I will come again to you.

29. The earth stays steady through truth. The ocean is steady through truth. The water flows steadily through truth. Everything is founded on truth.

Suta said:

30. When the hunter did not accept its proposal even after being implored thus, the bewildered and frightened hind spoke again:

The Hind said:

31-34. O hunter, listen. I shall explain. I take this vow. After going home if I do not return to you let me be smeared with the sin that these people have viz —A brahmin who sells the Vedas, one who does not offer Sandhyii prayers, women who transgress the commands of their husbands and do various rites, an ungrateful person, a person who is averse to Siva, a person who ill-treats others, who violates Virtue, a person committing breach of trust, and a person who deceives others.

35. When the hind made these promises the hunter believed it and said “Go home”.

36. The delighted hind drank water and went to its hermitage. By that time the first part of the night came to a close and the hunter did not have a wink of sleep.

37. The sister of the hind, not able to see it and so distressed came there in search of that hind. It too was thirsty.

38. On seeing the hind, the Bhilla drew the bow and was about to shoot the arrow. As before, water and Bilva leaves fell on Siva.

39. Incidentally it became the worship of the second part of the night. It was pleasing to the hunter.

40. The hind asked “O forest-roamer what are you doing?” After seeing him, the hunter replied as before. On hearing it, the hind said again.

41-42. “O hunter, listen. I am blessed. life is fruitful. A service can be rendered through this evanescent body. But my fawns, young ones, are in the house. I shall entrust them to the care of my husband and come again.” The hunter said:

43. “I do not agree to what you say. Undoubtedly I am going to kill you.” On hearing that the hind said on the oath of Siva.

44-47. “O hunter, listen. I shall explain. If a person breaks his words he forfeits his merits. If I do not return let me be smeared with the sin that accrues to such people who forsake their legally wedded wife and cohabit with another, who transgress the Vedic virtue and follow an imaginary and fictitious cult; who profess to be devoted to Visnu and censure Siva, who perform the K^ayaha rites of their parents on a Sunyatithi day and who add insult to injury.”

Suta said:

48. Implored by the hind, the hunter said to the hind, “go.” It drank water and delightedly went away to its hermitage.

49-50. By that time the second part of the night too came to a close without a wink of sleep to the hunter. When the third part arrived, the stag who was bewildered by the delay caused by the hind came there in search of it. The hunter saw it standing on the path leading to water.

51. On seeing the stout stag the hunter was delighted. He fixed the arrow to the bow and was about to kill it.

52. O dear, while he attempted to do this, a few Biiva leaves fell on Siva as a result of his Prarabdha.

53. In view of this, the worship of the third part of that night became realised due to his good fortune. Siva’s merciful nature was evident in this.

54. On hearing the noise the stag asked, “what are you doing?” The hunter replied “I am going to kill you for the sake of my family.”

55. On hearing this, the stag was delighted in his mind. Immediately he spoke to the hunter. The stag said:

56. I am blessed that I am well-nourished and enough to satisfy your needs. Of a person everything is useless if his body is of no avail.

57. If a person does not help others though he is capable of it, all his efficiency is vain. He will fall into hell after death.

58. But I must entrust my young ones to the care of their mother. I shall console them and return again.”

59. Thus requested the hunter was much surprised in his mind. With his heap of sins destroyed and with a purified mind he spoke these words. The hunter said:

60-61. O stag, every animal that came here has gone after promising in the manner that you have done now. They have not yet come. You too are in distress now and want to go under a false pretext. How, then, will I have my livelihood?

The stag said:

62. O hunter, listen, I shall explain.

lies. The entire universe including the mobile and immobile beings is steady, thanks to truth.

63. The merit of a liar melts away in a trice.* Still O, hunter, listen to my truthful promise.

64-66. If I do not come again, let me have the sin of these activities viz: —in having sexual intercourse at dusk, in taking food on Sivaratri day, in perjury, in misappropriation of Trust funds, in neglecting Sandhya prayers, in not uttering Siva’s name with the mouth, in not helping despite the ability, in breaking cocoanut on Parvan days, in taking forbidden food, in taking food before worshipping Siva or without applying Bhasma.

Suta said:

67. On hearing these words the hunter said “Go and return quickly.” Thus permitted by the hunter, the hunter drank water and went away.

68-69. All these animals who had promised in good faith, met at the hermitage. Hearing the news of one another in its entirety they decided that they should go because they were bound by the promise. They consoled the fawns and became eager to go back.

70-71. The senior hind spoke to its mate “O stag, without you, how can the young fawns stay here? O lord, it was I who promised at the outset. So I shall go. Both of you stay here.”

72. On hearing those words the junior hind spoke “I am your servant. Hence I go. You shall stay here.”

73. On hearing it, the stag said— “I am going there. Both of you stay here. Infants are guarded and looked after by their mothers.”

74. On hearing the words of their husband the two hinds did not consider it righteous. They lovingly told their husband, “Fie upon that life in widowhood.”

75. Then all of them consoled their fawns and entrusted them to the care of their neighbours. They went to the place where the hunter was waiting*

76. The fawns too seeing all these followed them thinking. “Let what befalls them happen to us as well.”

77. On seeing them, the delighted hunter fitted the

arrow to his bow. Water and leaves of the Bilva tree fell on Siva again.

# 78.

Thanks to that, the worship of the fourth part of the night too became auspiciously performed. Thereafter his sins were reduced to ashes in a trice.

# 79.

The senior hind, the junior hind and the stag said “O excellent hunter, make our body purposeful. Be merciful to us.”

# 80.

On hearing their words the hunter was surprised. Thanks to the power of the worship of Siva, he acquired perfect knowledge inaccessible to others.

# 81.

The deer are blessed. Though devoid of knowledge, they are ready to help others by offering their own bodies.

# 82.

What have I achieved despite being born as a human being? I have nourished my body by torturing others.

# 83.

I reared my family by committing many sins every day. Alas! what will be my fate after committing all these sins?

# 84.

Sins have been committed by me ever since my birth. What goal shall I attain? “Fie, Fie upon my life!”

# 85.

Acquiring perfect knowledge thus, he withdrew the arrow and explained — “O excellent deer! you are all blessed. You can safely go back.”

# 86.

When he said this, Siva became delighted. He revealed his form that is worshipped and honoured by the good.

# 87.

Touching him mercifully Siva spoke lovingly to the hunter, “O hunter, I am delighted at this Vrata. Ask for the boon you wish to have.”

# 88.

On seeing Siva’s form, the hunter became liberated in a trice. He fell at Siva’s feet saying, “Everything has been attained by me now.”

# 89.

Siva, delighted in his mind, gave him the name Guha. Glancing at him mercifully he gave him a divine boon.

Siva said: O hunter, listen. Have your capital at Srhgavera-pura and enjoy divine pleasures at your will. Your race will flourish without any calamity. O hunter, certainly lord Rama praised even by the gods will come to your house. He will make alliance with you. Co-operating with my devotee, your mind indulged in rendering service to me, you will attain salvation rare to others.

Suta said: In the meantime, having viewed Siva, the deer bowed to him and attained liberation from their birth as deer. They attained divine bodies, ascended the aerial chariot and went away. Released from curse at the very sight of Siva they attained heaven. Siva became Vyadhesvara on the Arbuda mount-ain. Viewing and worshipping this phallic idol bestows worldly pleasures and salvation. From that day onwards the hunter attained godly pleasures and being favoured by the god attained Sayujya salvation with Siva.

Even after performing this rite in utter ignorance he attained Sayujya; what about those who are endowed with devotion? They will surely attain complete identity with the lord. After considering all Sastras, and the sacred rites enjoined by these Sivaratrivrata, has been glorified as the most excellent. Different Vratas, various holy centres, gifts of variegated nature, diverse sacrifices, different austerities and many forms of Japas, are not equal to Sivaratrivrata. Hence this auspicious Vrata shall be performed.

KofirudrasarHhitd 1439 by those who wish for bcneficcncc. Sivaratri Vrata is divine and it always yields worldly pleasures and salvation.

102. Thus I have narrated the auspicious Sivaratri Vrata entirely. It is famous as the chief of sacred rites. What else do you wish to hear?

# CHAPTER FORTYONE

# (Review of salvation)

The sages said:

1. What is liberation has been explained by you. What will happen in that state? What is the nature of that state? Please explain to us.
2. Suta said: Liberation is of four types. May this be heard. I shall tell you. It quells the pain of worldly existence. It bestows the greatest bliss.
3. It is fourfold: — Sarupya (identity in form), Salokya (being within the view of the lord or in the same world), Sannidhya (proximity with the lord), and Sayujya (complete identity with him). The fourth arises out of this Vrata.
4. O great sages, only Siva can bestow liberation. Brahma and others cannot do that. They shall be known as bestowers of virtue, wealth and love.
5. Brahma and others are dependent on the attributes. Siva is beyond the attributes. He is free from aberrations. He is the great Brahman, the fourth deity, greater than Prakrti.
6. He is in the form of knowledge. He is imperishable and unchangeable. He is the cosmic witness, attainable through knowledge. He is without a second. He is the bestower of Trivarga (Dharma, Artha, Kama) and the Kaivalya liberation.

When the soul is detached from matter and debarred from further transmigration, it is said to be in isolation or the state of beatitude.



---


# 7. A fifth type of salvation Kaivalya

is inaccessible to men in every respect. O excellent sages, I shall explain its characteristics. May that be heard.

# 8-9.

O great sages, Siva’s form is twofold: Saguna and Nirguna as explained in the Vedas. It is that from which the entire universe originates, by which it is protected and in which it merges and by whom all this has been pervaded.

# 10.

It is not known to Visnu nor to Brahma. It is not known to Kumara and others nor to Narada.

# 11.

It is not known to Suka, son of Vyasa nor to Vyasa or other great sages. It is not known to the earlier beings, all the gods, all the Vedas and all the Sastras.

# 12.

It is truth, knowledge, the infinity. It is named Saccidananda (existence, knowledge, bliss). It is Nirguna, Nirvyadhi (free from limitations and conditions). It is imperishable. It is pure and unsullied.

# 13.

It is neither red nor yellow, neither white nor blue, neither short nor long, neither gross nor subtle.

# 14.

That great Brahman Siva is said to be that from which all words return along with the mind, unable to attain it.

# 15.

This is all pervasive like the expansive firmament. It is the great soul beyond Maya. It is beyond Dvandvas* mutually clashing opposites and free from rivalry.

# 16.

O brahmins, good people attain it when knowledge of Siva rises up or when they worship him with deep devotion.

# 17.

The knowledge is difficult to attain but worship can easily be performed. Hence, O excellent sages, worship Siva for the attainment of salvation too.

# 18.

Siva is subservient to worship. He is knowledge-souled and the greatest bestower of salvation. Many Siddhas have joyously attained the great salvation through devotion alone.

# 19.

Devotion to Siva, characterised by sprouting pure love, is the mother of perfect knowledge. It is easy of access by means of his benevolence. It yields worldly pleasures and salvation too.

# 20-21.

Devotion is of various types. O brahmins, it is both Saguna and Nirguna* Whatever is legitimate and



---

KofirudrasarfikUd
natural is the most excellent and the greatest. It is again two-fold: Naisthika (permanent and attended with ritualistic observances) and Anaisthika (non-Naisthika). The Naisthika is of six varieties and the other is only of one type.

22. Learned men consider devotion to be of different sorts, such as ordained and non-ordained. Since they are of various types they are not explained in detail.

23. Differentiated by the differences in those who observe Sravana (listening) etc. both these are of nine sub-divisions each. Without his favour they are difficult of performance and with His favour they can easily be performed. O brahmins, devotion and knowledge199 are essentially non-different from each other as explained by Siva. Hence, they should not be differentiated. Happiness befalls him who observes them always.

24. O brahmins, a person who is against devotion will never attain perfect knowledge. Knowledge rises up immediately only in him who observes devotion to Siva.

25. Hence, O great sages, devotion to lord Siva shall be practised. There is no doubt in this that everything is realizable solely through devotion.

26. Thus, what has been ashed by you has been explained. There is no doubt in this that on hearing this, one is rid of his sin completely.

# CHAPTER FORTYTWO

# (The difference between Saguna and Mrguna)

The sages said:

1. Who is Siva? Who is Visnu? Who is Rudra? Who is Brahma? Of these who is Nirguna? Please clear this doubt of ours.

199. Devotion and realization are separate (41-17) but not contradictory terms. The two paths leading to the goal of liberation are complementary, running parallel to each other.

# Siuapurartc

Suta said:

1. Masters of the Vedas and Vedanta know that which originates from the Nirguna great soul as the one termed Siva.
2. Prakrti accompanied by Purusa originated from him. Penance was performed by them both. The famous city Ka$i known as PaficakrosI, dear to all, originated in the water there at the base. There was water everywhere in the universe.
3. Visnu famous as Narayana slept there enveloped by Maya. The Prakrti is known as Narayani (belonging to Narayana).
4. He who was born of his umbilical lotus was Pitamaha. He who was seen by him through penance is said to be Visnu.
5. The form that was revealed by Nirguna Siva at the time of subduing the dispute between the two is, O learned ones, famous as Mahadeva.
6. This was said by him, “I will be Siva with fire in my forehead.” He became fartious by the name Rudra. He is the cause of blessing the worlds.
7. The formless one became one with forms in order to facilitate meditation. He alone is Siva himself, favourably disposed towards his devotees.
8. Essentially there is no difference between Siva who is different from the three Gunas and Rudra the abode of Gunas, as in the case of gold and an ornament made thereof.
9. Their forms and activities are the same; they bestow good goal on the devotees equally; they are equally worthy of being served by all and they indulge in various divine sports.
10. Rudra of terrible exploits has the form of Siva in every respect. He was born for carrying out the tasks of the devotees. He helps Visnu and Brahma.
11. Other beings and gods who are born get dissolved in due order but not so Rudra. Rudra gets merged in Siva.
12. This is the directive in the Vedas that all these Prakftas (born of Prakrti) meet Rudra and go but Rudra does not meet these and go.

# Ko firudrasarhhitd

# 1443

15. All worship Rudra but Rudra does not worship any one. Yet due to his favourable attitude to his devotees sometimes he worships himself.

16. Those who worship others get dissolved in them. That is why they attain Rudra in due course, O learned ones.

17. Those who are Rudra’s devotees attain the state of Siva in a trice. They need not depend on any one else. This is the eternal statement in the Vedas.

18. O brahmins, ignorance is of various types. Perfect knowledge is not so. I shall explain their modes. Listen respectively.

19. Whatever is seen here beginning with Brahma is Siva himself. The concept of manifoldness is unreal.

20. Siva is said to be before creation. Siva is there in the midst of creation. Siva is said to be at the end of creation. When everything is a void, Sadasiva exists.

21. O great sages, thus Siva is fourfold. He alone shall be known as Saguna. In view of the possession of Sakti he is twofold.

22. It is by him that the eternal Vedas, syllables, syllabic instants and his meditation and worship were given to Visnu. The eternal Sruti — “Isanah Sarvavidyanam” says

23. Hence Siva is the creator of the Vedas and the lord of the Vedas.

24. He alone is Siva himself who blesses all. He is the creator, sustainer and annihilator. He is the cosmic witness and Nirguna.

25. Restriction of time is for others and not for Rudra. He is Mahakala himself associating with Mahakali.

26. It is so that Brahmins mention Rudra and Kali. Thanks to their wish and truthful sports everything is obtained by them.

27. He has no progenitor, no sustainer and no annihilator. He himself is the cause of all. Visnu and others are his creations.

28. He is not the creation of any one. Though single he assumes manifold shapes. Seeming to be many he becomes unified into one.

29. A single seed grows into a tree and produces many seeds. Even in their multiplicity they are of one tree. Mahe&#x26;vara in the form of Siva is verily like this.

30. This is the great knowledge of Siva explained factually. O great sages, only the wise know this, none else.

The sages said:

31. Please explain that knowledge with all its characteristics realising which one attains the state of Siva. How is Siva all and how is all Siva?

Vydsa said:

32. On hearing these words, Suta the excellent pounder of the Puranas remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and spoke these words to the sages.

# CHAPTER FORTYTHREE

# [Review of Knowledge]

Sdta said:

1. O ye sages, may this be heard. I shall explain the perfect knowledge of Siva in the manner I have heard. It is a great secret as it is the form of the highest salvation.

2. In the assembly of Brahma, Narada, Kumara, Vyasa and Kapila they had discussed this and come to this conclusion.

3. It shall be known that the entire universe is wholly Siva. That Siva is in everything must be known by the learned scholar.

4. Beginning with Brahma and ending with a blade of grass whatever is seen as constituting the universe is Siva himself. That deity is called Siva.

5. When he wishes, this is created. He alone knows all. No one knows him.

6. He himself creates it and enters it but stands far.

Kotiruirasarhhitu
1445

1. The Citsvarupa (knowledge-formed) being who is pure does not really enter it.
2. Luminary beings are reflected in water etc. They do not actually enter them. Similarly Siva too appears entering other things.
3. Really Siva alone, the auspicious being, manifests himself. The ignorance of the same is a defect of the mind. In fact there is no second entity.
4. In all philosophical systems the concept of duality is evident. But the Vedantins call him eternal and non-dualistic.
5. The individual soul, though it is a part of his, becomes deluded by Avidya. He then thinks that he is different. If he is released from Avidya he becomes Siva.
6. Siva pervades all creatures. He is the lord of the sentient and the insentient. He is the benefactor.
7. He who cleverly tries means of realising him after resorting to the Vedantic path attains the fruit of his sight.
8. Just as the pervading fire is latent in every block of wood but only he who churns it sees it manifested, to be sure.
9. So also, the clever devotee who makes use of the expedients of devotion etc. certainly reaches Siva. This is undoubtedly true.
10. Lord Siva is everywhere. There is nothing else. Siva appears in different forms always due to our illusion.
11. The ocean or the lump of clay or the piece of gold attains different shapes due to delimiting conditions. Siva too is so.
12. There is one essential difference between the material cause and its effect. The difference is due to illusory perception. If the one ceases to exist, the other is quelled.
13. The shooting sprout from a seed may exhibit multiplicity but ultimately it becomes the seed and the shoot perishes.
14. The perfectly wise is the seed. Deformity is the sprout. When the deformity disappears he becomes the perfectly wise again. There is nothing to doubt in this regard.



---

Sivapur&#x26;na
# 20.

Everything is Siva. Siva is everything. There is no difference at all. How is this manifoldness seen? How is the unity regained?

# 21.

Just as the luminary called the sun is seen differently in water etc. so also is the case with it.

# 22.

The all-pervading sky is not bound or fettered anywhere. So also the all-pervading lord is not bound anywhere.

# 23.

The individual soul is contaminated by the ego. Siva is free from it. The individual soul is insignificant and it experiences the fruits of actions. But the great Siva is uncontaminated.

# 24.

Gold mixed with silver or other base metal depreciates in value. So also is the individual soul in its association with the ego.

# 25.

When a gold alloy is purified with chemicals it regains its original value. Similarly the consecrated soul too attains purity.

# 26.

The devotee at the outset shall go to a competent preceptor with devout and reverential feelings. He shall worship and serve him considering him Siva.

# 27.

Thanks to this conception, all sins and dirts are removed from the body. When he gains knowledge his ignorance disappears.

# 28.

Freed from the ego, the individual soul attains pure intellect. Thanks to Siva’s grace he attains the state of Siva again.

# 29.

Just as one sees one’s own form in the mirror so also the pure soul sees the all-pervading Siva, certainly.

# 30.

He becomes the living liberated soul. When the body perishes he merges into Siva. The body is begot by the Prarabdha karman. The perfectly wise is considered different from it.

# 31.

If a person is not elated on acquiring something good and is not annoyed on acquiring something bad and if he has equanimity, he is said to be perfectly wise.

# 32-33.

By the practice of Yoga, discrimination between the different principles is generated. Then there is a desire.

# KofinuIrasaTfihitd

to get released from the body. The aspirant then is blessed with devotion to Siva.

# 34.

From devotion there arises love; from love, the desire to hear about the lord; from this desire, association with the good and from this association a competent preceptor is attained.

# 35.

If knowledge is attained he certainly becomes liberated. Hence if one desires to be perfectly wise one should worship Siva alone always.

# 36.

He shall worship Siva with unflinching and exclusive devotion. Salvation is the result. There is nothing to be doubtful about this.

# 37.

There is no other deity greater than Siva for the attainment of salvation. After seeking refuge in him one withdraws from worldly existence.

# 38.

O brahmins, these words have been uttered by me after considering the statement of sages. You shall retain these strenuously in your minds.

# 39.

At the outset this instruction was given to Vishnu by Siva in front of his phallic image. It was then given to Brahma by Vishnu and to Sanaka and others by Brahma.

# 40.

That knowledge was then imparted to Narada by Sanaka and others. Narada communicated it to Vyasa and the merciful Vyasa communicated it to me.

# 41.

I have now communicated it to you. For the welfare of the world you shall establish this in the world strenuously. It is conducive to the attainment of Siva.

# 42.

O great sages; thus, what I have been asked has been narrated by me. You shall preserve this carefully. What else do you wish to hear?

# Vyasa said:

# 43.

On hearing this, the sages attained great bliss. After bowing to him they eulogised him again and again with words choked with pleasure.

200. The Skt text of the verses 32, 33 is defective. The present translation is not literal therefore.

201. Sinaki, SanancU, San.itana, Sanatkumaia are the four mind-born sons of Brahma who, declining to create progeny, remained boys forever. The puranas recount their number variously, four, five or seven.

# 1448

The sages said:

# 44.

O disciple of Vyasa, obeisance be to you. You are blessed. You are the most excellent of the devotees of Siva. The highest thing, the excellent knowledge of Siva has been imparted to us.

# 45.

Thanks to your mercy, our mental delusion has vanished. Securing the excellent knowledge of Siva from you we are satisfied. This knowledge yields salvation.

Sita said: O brahmins, not be mentioned an

# 46.

this shall to atheist or an unfaithful man or a rogue. Nor shall it be mentioned to one who has no devotion to Siva or who does not wish to hear.

# 47.

After poring through Itihasas, Puranas, Vedas and Sastras many a time, Vyasa extracted this essence and imparted it to me.

# 48.

On hearing this once, all sins are reduced to ashes. A non-devotee becomes a devotee. This enhances the devotion of the devotee.

# 49.

If it is heard again one attains good devotion. If it is heard again liberation is attained. Hence this must be heard again and again by the devotees who desire to get the benefit of worldly pleasures and salvation.

# 50.

With the expectation of the greatest benefit it shall be repeated five times. There is no doubt. He will attain it. Vyasa has said so.

# 51.

Nothing is difficult to get for a man who hears this excellent thing. By repeating it five times Siva’s vision is attained.

# 52.

Ancient kings, brahmins and excellent Vaishyas have attained great Siddhis by listening to this with attention, five times.

# 53.

Even now if a man listens to this with devotion he will attain perfect knowledge of Siva, worldly pleasures and salvation.

Vyasa said:

# 54.

On hearing his words the sages were extremely

delighted. They worshipped Suta with reverence offering him various articles.

55. Satisfied and cleared of their doubts they bowed to him, eulogised him, hailed him, and blessed him.

56. Considering Suta to be the great lord Siva they worshipped him and bowed to him. With good intellect they praised him speaking to one another.

57. The excellent knowledge of Siva is pleasing to Siva; it yields worldly pleasures and salvation; it enhances devotion to Siva. It is divine.

58. Thus the fourth meritorious and pleasing compendium of Sivapurana named Kofirudra has been narrated.

59. He who listens to this with devotion and narrates this with pure mind enjoys all pleasures here and attains salvation hereafter.

# UMASAMHITA

# CHAPTER ONE

# (Kr$na meets Upamanyu)

1. We meditate upon Siva, the perfect deity, who supports the seven203 worlds with the Sattva Guna as his attribute, who creates them resorting to Rajas and who annihilates them when endowed with Tamas; who is beyond Maya consisting of the Gunas and who stands firm; who is truth, bliss, and the infinite pure consciousness; who assumes the names of Brahma etc. and who is attained always by the application of Sattva Guna.

The sages said:

2. O Suta of great intelligence, O Suta, disciple of Vyasa, obeisance be to you. The fourth compendium Kofirudra sambita has been narrated by you.

3. Now please narrate the story of Siva, the supreme soul, accompanied by Uma—Parvatl—the story that is full of incidental anecdotes.

Suta said:

4. O Saunaka 201 and other sages, please listen with devotion to the divinely auspicious story of Siva, that yields worldly pleasures and salvation.

203. Lokas are commonly enumerated as three, viz heaven, earth and the atmosphere or lower regions but a fuller classification gives seven worlds, viz (i) the earth, (ii) the space between the earth and the sun inhabited by Munis, Siddhas, etc. (iii) India's heaven above the sun or between it and the polar star (iv) a region above the polar star, inhabited by Bhrgu and other saints who survive the destruction of the 3 lower worlds (v) inhabited by Brahma’s son Sanat-Kumara etc., (vi) inhabited by deified Vairagins (vii) or abode of.

# 5.

This same holy question was put by the excellent sage Vyasa to Sanatkumara who narrated the story of Siva. Sanatkumara said:

# 6.

O Vyasa, the story of lord Siva which was mentioned to Krsna by the sage Upamanyu, I narrate to you.

# 7.

Formerly Krsna, son of Vasudeva went to Kailasa, the abode of Siva in order to perform the penance to propitiate Siva for obtaining a son.

# 8.

On seeing the sage Upamanyu performing the penance on the excellent summit he bowed to him with devotion and asked him with palms joined in reverence. Lord Krsna said:

# 9.

O Upamanyu of great intellect, O forerunner of the devotees of Siva with good intellect. I have come here to perform the penance of Siva for obtaining a son.

# 10.

O sage, please narrate the greatness of Siva, delightful to the good, on hearing which I shall perform the penance of Siva with devotion.

Sanatkumara said:

# 11.

On hearing these words of the intelligent Krsna, Upamanyu was delighted in his mind. Remembering Siva, he replied.

Upamanyu said:

# 12.

O Krsna, great devotee of Siva, listen to the glory of Siva which I have witnessed myself. It is an excellent story that enhances devotion to Siva.

# 13.

While performing penance, I saw Siva, his weapons, his followers and Vishnu and other gods.

# 14.

He was shining with his three parts. He was of permanent happiness. He was imperishable. He had one foot and huge teeth with faces having mouthfuls of blazing flame.

# 15.

He was shining with the brilliance of two thousand.

205. Upamanyu, pupil of Ayoda Dhaumya propagated Siva cult and received the Ocean of milk from lord Siva.

He was whirling excellent missiles. He had many eyes and a thousand legs.

16-17. He who decisively annihilates the universe at the end of a kalpa and for whom there was none to be spared from death in the three worlds consisting of the mobile and immobile beings which being cast away from his hands burnt instantaneously and entirely, certainly within half a moment.

18. While performing penance, I saw at the side of Rudra the imperishable highly secret weapon which had no other missile superior or equal to it.

19. It was the weapon Vijaya, the trident of the fierce weapon that destroyed all other weapons and missiles.

20. There is no doubt that it could pierce through the entire earth, dry up the big ocean and cause all the luminary bodies to fall.

21. It was the weapon with which YauvanaSva208 the emperor of great refulgence and Mandhatr the powerful king who conquered the three worlds were killed formerly.

22. The arrogant Haihaya209 king was killed with it. When the demon Lavana210 challenged king Satrughna this missile was hurled at him.

23. When that demon was killed this trident had returned to Rudra. It had a sharp point and was highly terrifying.

24. It stood as if threatening all with the three spikes for its knit eyebrows. It was like a blazing smokeless fire and the rising sun.

25-26. I saw his sharp-edged axe decorated with serpents etc. It was as terrible as the god of death holding.

207. The epithet identifies Siva with the thousand-footed Puiu?a mentioned in the Purusasiikta of the Rgveda.

208. Yauvanaiva was the patronymic of M&#x26;ndhatr. It should not be confused with yauvan&#x26;£va, the grandson of MSndhatr.

209. Most probably it refers to the Haihaya king Arjuna K&#x26;rttavlrya, of a thousand arms who was defeated and had his arms cut off by Paratarama.

210. Lavana, king of Mathur&#x26;, was the son of Madhu by Kumbhinash, the sister of Rivaija. He had inherited from his father an invincible trident which had been presented to him by Siva. He was surprised without his weapons and killed by Satrughna.

the noose in his hand. It was like an indescribable ray of the sun and the features of the fire at the end of Kalpas. It had the size of a full-grown man. Bhargava Rama had used it in the battle for the extermination of Kshatriyas.

27. It was given to Rama by Siva formerly. Strengthened by it the delighted sage burnt the Kshatriyas twenty-one times.

28. I saw the discus Sudarsana in the shape of a human being with a thousand faces and two thousand hands. It was divine and lordly.

29. It had two thousand eyes of fiery brilliance, and one thousand legs. It shone like a crore suns. It was capable of burning the three worlds.

30. I saw the sharp and refulgent thunderbolt of hundred spikes of extreme excellence. I saw the great bow Pinaka of excessive brilliance and its quiver of arrows.

31. I saw the Sakti, the sword, the noose of great brilliance and a goad, the great divine iron club, and many other weapons.

32. On either side of Lord Rudra, I saw the weapons of the guardians of the quarters.

33. To the right of the lord was Brahma, the grandfather of the worlds seated in his aerial chariot fitted with a swan. It was divine and as speedy as mind.

34. Narayana, holding conch, discus and mace, stood on his left, seated on the Garuda.

35. Brahma and other Manus, Bhargava and other sages, Indra and other gods, all were there.

36. Holding his Sakti and a bell and seated on his peacock, Skanda stood near the goddess like another fire god.

37. Nandin stood in front of Siva holding the trident. All the goblins, Ganas and the mothers were present there.

38. Bowing to lord Siva and surrounding him on all sides, the gods eulogised the lord with different kinds of hymns.

211. With the axe received from lord Siva, Parasurama cleared the earth of the Kshatriyas thrice seven times and gave the earth to the Brahmins.

212. The Sanskrit text of this verse is defective.

39. I saw on either side of the lord whatever is seen or heard in this world. I was surprised at it.

40-41. O Krsna, it appeared as though some sacrifice was going on there. In that sacrifice I became immersed in great delight. I was bold to a great extent on seeing Siva in front. With palms joined in reverence and words choked with tears of joy I worshipped him duly with various kinds of hymns.

42. Then the delighted lord Siva spoke to me laughingly in sweet words with great pleasure.

43. “O brahmin, you cannot be shaken by me though I try again and again. You have been tested by me. Welfare be to you. You are steadily endowed with devotion.

44. O one of good rites, I am delighted. Choose the boon. There is nothing which cannot be given to you even if it happens to be something rare and inaccessible to all the gods.”

45. On hearing the loving words of Siva I spoke to the lord sympathetic with the devotees with palms joined in reverence.

Upamanyu said:

46. “O lord, if you are satisfied and if my devotion is firm and steady, may, in virtue of that truth, my knowledge comprehend the past, present and future.

47. Grant me infinite devotion never swerving or straying from you. Let me and my family have milk pudding every day. O may you be my hermitage present in every day. Let my mutual friendship with your other devotees flourish for ever.”

48. O leading scion of the family of Yadus, thus requested by me, lord Siva laughed and glanced at me with his merciful eyes. He said to me.

Siva said:

50. O Upamanyu, O dear, O sage, you will be free from the defects of old age and death. Achieve all desires.

51. You will deserve the worship of the sages.

Umisarhhitd 1455 will have fame as your wealth. Thanks to my grace, step by step, you will possess good conduct, beauty, good qualities and riches. O wherever you wish milk will flow to and be present there.

By the time that nectarine milk is fully controlled you will see Vaivasvata Kalpa along with your kinsmen.

O great sage, may your family be never-ending due to my grace. I shall be always present in your hermitage. Let your devotion to me be permanent. O dear one, whenever remembered by you I shall appear before you. You are by all means my beloved.

Be happy realizing all your desires. Do not get anxious or worried. There is no doubt that everything you think of will be fulfilled.

Upamanyu said: granting me boons and saying this, Siva of the brilliance of a crore suns vanished there itself.

O Krsna, Siva, the supreme lord the bestower of worldly pleasures and salvation, was thus seen by me accompanied by his followers.

Whatever was mentioned by the intelligent lord Siva has been wholly acquired by me by meditating on the lord of the gods.

See for yourself the Gandharvas, Apsaras, sages, Vidyadharas and the well arranged Siddhas.

See the beautiful trees endowed with glossy leaves, fragrant with seasonal flowers and bearing fruits and flowers.

O mighty hero, all these are the results of the grace of Siva the great soul, the lord of gods. The universe is emotionally agreeable.

I have the perfect knowledge of everything, thanks to the grace of the Trident-bearing lord. I know factually the past, present and the future, everything.

See P. 224 note.

64. I have seen the lord whom even the great gods do not see without propitiating. Who can be more blessed than I?

65. The eternal principles are known as twentysix. 214 Learned men meditate on the great and imperishable thus.

66. That great lord alone is the knower of well-ordained principles, the direct perceiver of all true objects and the lord of Prakrti and Purusa.

67. It was he who created, for the protection of the worlds, Brahma, the cause of the worlds, from his right hand and Visnu from the left hand side.

68. When the Kalpa came to an end, the lord created Rudra from his heart. Then he annihilated the universe including the mobile and immobile beings.

69. At the end of Yugas, lord Siva becomes Kala and stands devouring all the living beings, like the fire of dissolution Samvartaka.

70. The lord is omniscient, the soul and the material and effective cause of all living beings. He is all-pervasive and visible to all deities.

71. Hence, propitiate him for the acquisition of a son. Siva, favourably disposed to his devotees will become delighted with you, soon.

# 8.

The weapons, missiles, discus, thunderbolt never became effective in the body of Graha of great might during battles, thanks to the Dharma of that intelligent one.

# CHAPTER THREE

# (The greatness of Siva)

Sanatkumara said:

1. On hearing his words Krsna was much surprised. He spoke to the sage Upamanyu of quiet mind.

Krsna said:

2. O great brahmin, you are blessed. Who can adequately eulogise you and be contented. In your hermitage the lord of the gods himself is ever present.

3. O leading sage, will the lord Siva grant me his vision? Will he do me this favour?

Upamanyu said:

4. O Purusottama, there is no doubt that ere long you will see lord Siva, thanks to his own grace.

5. In the sixteenth month you will get good boons from lord Siva and his wife. O Krsna, why should not the lord grant you the boons?

6. O Visnu, thanks to your good qualities, you deserve worship of the gods. You are always praiseworthy. I shall explain a mantra if you have faith enough.

7. By the virtue of that mantra you will see Siva. You will acquire a son, equal in strength to you, by the favour of lord Siva.

8. O Krsna, perform the Japa of this most efficacious

# Stvapurdna

mantra viz. “Om Namah Sivaya.” It yields all desires. It is divine. It bestows worldly pleasures and salvation.

Sanatkumdra said:

1. O sage, even as he was narrating these stories about lord Siva, eight days passed by as it were a single Muhurta.
2. When the ninth day dawned he was initiated. He was instructed in Siva’s mantra, the great one mentioned in the Atharvaveda.
3. Immediately he grew matted hair and then clean-shaven. With great purity of mind he began to perform penance standing on the big toes of the feet and lifting up the hands.
4. When the sixteenth month arrived lord Siva was satisfied. Accompanied by Parvatl, Siva granted his vision to Krsna. Lord Kr?na saw Siva thus: —He was accompanied by Parvatl.
5. The moon-crested lord had three eyes. He was being eulogised by Brahma and others and worshipped by crores of Siddhas. He was wearing divine garlands and cloths. He was being bowed to by gods and Asuras, humbled by devotion. He was bedecked in different ornaments. He was lustrous. The unborn and imperishable god was full of wondrous things. He was accompanied by various Ganas and his two sons. On seeing him lord Kr$na was much surprised. His eyes beamed with wonder. Delightfully and jubilantly he bowed to him.
6. He worshipped him with different hymns. With drooping shoulders he eulogised the lord of gods with the thousand names.
7. Thus the gods, Gandharvas, Vidyadharas and the great serpents showered flowers and congratulated him delightfully.
8. Glancing at Parvatl’s face the delighted lord Rudra, favourably disposed towards his devotees spoke to Kesava even as his splendour spread all round.

Lord Siva said:

steady in my rites. Choose holy boons from me even if they be inaccessible to the people of the three worlds.

Sanatkumara said:

21. On hearing his words Krsna spoke to Siva the lord of all, respectfully, with palms joined in reverence, after bowing to him again and again.

Krsna said: O lord Siva, lord of the gods,

22. O I solicit excellent boons from you, MaheSvara, you have already thought of them.

23-25. Let my mind be always in your cult. Let my fame be steady. Let me have nearness to you. Let my devotion to you be always unflinching. Let my senior sons have ten sons each. Let all my enemies who are arrogant by their might be killed in battle. O lord, nowhere shall I suffer dishonour from enemies. I shall be the beloved of all Yogins.

26. O lord of gods, grant me these eight good boons. Obeisance be to you. You alone are the lord of all and especially my master.

Sanatkumara said:

27. On hearing his words, lord Siva said to him. Let your desire be fulfilled. After saying this the trident-bearing lord said again.

28. The terrible sun Samvartaka at the time of dissolution cursed by the sages will be born as your mighty and virile son Samba.

29. (The curse was) “You will be born as a man.” He will become your son. Whatever you have sought you will obtain.

Sanatkumara said:

30. After getting the boons from lord Siva, lord Krsna delighted him with hymns.

31. The delighted Parvati favourably disposed to her devotees, spoke to lord Krsna the noble soul, the devotee of Siva and who had performed the penance of lord Siva.

Parvati said:

# 32.

O Kfsna of great intellect, O sinless son of Vasudeva, I am delighted with you. Take from me too some boons that are rare in the world.

Sanatkumdra said:

# 33.

On hearing the words of Parvati the leading descendant of Yadu²²⁰, very much delighted in his heart, spoke with great devotion in his mind.

Lord Krfna said:

# 34-35.

O goddess, if you are satisfied, if you are going to grant me boons due to my penance, truly let not my heart be inimical to brahmins. Let it be full of good will. I shall always worship the brahmins. My parents shall remain pleased with me.

# 36.

Wherever I go let me be agreeable to all living beings. As a result of seeing you, let there be the birth of deserving progeny in my family.

# 37.

I shall propitiate Indra and other gods with a hundred sacrifices and honour thousands of ascetics and guests always.

# 38.

Let me feed everyone at my house with dishes sanctified by faith. Let there be pleasure and excellent satisfaction amongst the kinsmen.

# 39.

O goddess, consort of Siva, I shall be the beloved lover of thousands of wives. Let my love appeal to them and remain unfading and unfailing.

# 40.

Let their parents be the speakers of truth in the world. Parvati, thanks to your grace, let these and other excellent boons take effect.

Sanatkumdra said:

# 41.

On hearing his words, the eternal goddess, the

220. Krspa was of the Yadava race, being descended from Yadu, one of the sons of Yayati. The yadavas of old were a pastoral race and dwelt on the river Yamunfi in VfndSvana on the western side and in Gokula on the other.

# 1465

bestower of all desires, spoke to him in surprise “Hail to you. Let it be so.”

42. After granting Krsna these boons and blessing him mercifully Parvati and Siva vanished there itself.

43. O great sage, Krsna, felt as if he had achieved his purpose. Immediately he went to the excellent hermitage of the sage Upamanyu.

44. Bowing his head to the sage, Krsna, the slayer of Ke$in, narrated all the details to Upamanyu. He said:

45. “O Janardana, except lord Siva who else can there be the lord of great gifts or very unbearable if infuriated?

46. O Krsna of great fame, listen to the lordly glory of Siva about his perfect knowledge, austerity, heroism and fortitude during dangers.

47. On hearing that, Krsna became endowed with faith and devotion to Siva. He asked him about Siva’s glory. The great sage narrated thus.

Upamanyu said:

48. Formerly in the region of Brahma lord Siva was eulogised with his thousand names by the noble-souled Brahma bearing the staff.

49. The Samkhyas read that song of prayer as it were a big lexicon. That hymn bestows all desires on men though inscrutable to them.

50. O Krsna, return home happily remembering Siva constantly. O dear, you will always be the foremost among Siva’s devotees.

51. Thus permitted by him, Ke£ava the son of Vasudeva made obeisance to the sage and returned to Dvaraka mentally remembering Siva.

Sanatkumdra said:

52. O great sage, Krsna became contented and invincible after propitiating Siva, the benefactor of the worlds.

221. For a thousand names of Siva see KRS Ch. 35.

# Sivapurdna

53. Similarly, O great sage, Rama, the son of Dasaratha, devoutly propitiated Siva and became contented and victorious everywhere.

54. O sage, after performing a great penance on the mountain, Rama secured from Siva a bow and an arrow and the excellent knowledge.

55. He built the bridge on the ocean, killed Ravana with his followers, regained Sita, returned home and enjoyed the whole earth.

56-57. Similarly Parasurama, who was distressed on seeing his father killed by the Kshatriyas, propitiated lord Siva by his penance. From the delighted lord Siva he secured a sharp-edged axe. With that he exterminated the Kshatriyas twenty-one times.

58. Even today Siddhas and Caranas see this storehouse of penance deathless and invincible engaged in worshipping the phallic image.

59. Rama stays on the mountain Mahendra and performs penance. At the end of the Kalpa he will attain the region of the sage.

60-61. The ascetic Devala, younger brother of Asita, harassed the universe formerly by clutching at its root. He was then cursed by the lord, destroyer of cities. He performed penance by propitiating the phallic image that bestows all desires and removes the past evil.

62-63. Grtsamada, son of Caksu§amanu became a deer in the desert in the Darujaka forest by the curse of Vasistha. Alone he roamed about, devoutly remembering in his heart, Siva along with the Pranava om. After his death he became a deer-faced Gana.

64. Thus passing through the curse he was made free from death and old age by Siva and lovingly appointed as a permanent follower of Ganesa.

# 67.

The satisfied lord Siva granted to Para£ara, a powerful Yogin as the son who was free from old age and death and was known as Vedavyasa.

# 68.

Mandavya who had been fixed to a stake for a million years was released by Siva and blessed with longevity.

# 69-77.

Formerly there was a poor brahmin householder. He had kept his son Galava in the house of his preceptor. Whenever any mendicant visited his house this brahmin hid himself. He used to tell his wife, “No doubt I am a householder. But what can I offer to a guest? If any poor man comes you shall tell him “My husband is not here.” It happened once that a guest oppressed by thirst and hunger visited the house. He asked the lady “Where is your husband? Where has he gone?” She replied “My husband is not here.” Knowing the truth by his divine vision the sage said, “He is hidden inside the house.” The brahmin died in his hiding place. When permitted by his preceptor ViSvarnitra, the son of the brahmin, Galava returned home and heard from his mother the terrible calamity that had overtaken them. He propitiated lord Siva and performed Siva’s worship. When he went out of his house remembering Siva in his heart, he saw his father alive again who on seeing the son standing with palms joined in reverence said—“Thanks to the favour of lord Siva I am blessed and satisfied. I have been resuscitated to life again and also blessed with wealth.”

# 78.

Thus everything has been narrated to you. I am really not competent to express the qualities of Siva in brief or in detail. Even Se?a*s tongues may not be competent for the task.

The sages said: — (The exhibition of Siva’s spell)

1. O dear, O fortunate one, you are blessed, O dear one of great intellect. This wonderful narrative of Siva that bestows great devotion has been narrated.

2. Mention again the story of Siva in accordance with Vyasa’s enquiry. You are omniscient. You are the disciple of Vyasa and an expert in Siva’s principles.

3. It was in this very same manner that my preceptor Vyasa asked Sanatkumara, son of Brahma, who was an omniscient great sage and a devotee of Siva.

Vyasa said:

4. O omniscient Sanatkumara, this auspicious story of Siva, the great lord indulging in different sports has been narrated to you.

5. Speak again particularly of the greatness of lord Siva. O dear, my faith and eagerness to hear the same is great and it increases.

6. Who are the people deluded by the Maya of Siva who indulges in great sports? What is that greatness by which their knowledge has been deluded?

Sanatkumara said:

7. O Vyasa, of great intellect, listen to the pleasing story of Siva, the mere hearing of which generates devotion to Siva.

8. Lord Siva is the lord of all, soul of all and the vision of all. The entire universe has been pervaded by his greatness.

9. It is the great image of Siva that manifests as Brahma, Vishnu and Siva. It is that which has become the soul of all living beings. It is both three-symbolled and symbol-less.

10. There are eight classes of gods. Human beings

Constitute the ninth. There are five types of lower beings. Thus there are fourteen types of living beings.

11. All living beings past, present and future originate from Siva, flourish in him and finally merge into him.

12-13. Siva is the kinsman, friend, guide, protector, leader, purposeful preceptor, wish-yielding Kalpa tree, brother, father or mother of Brahma, Indra, Vi?nu, moon, the gods, danavas, serpents, Gandharvas, human beings and all others.

14. Siva is identical with all; self-manifest to all men, greater than the greatest. Than him it is impossible to predicate any other greater thing.

15. O sage, his Maya is divine and great pervading everything. The entire universe is subservient to it, inclusive of the gods, Asuras and human beings.

16. All heroic beings, even Visnu and mighty people, have been overwhelmed by the mighty Kama, born of the mind who has no other helper.

17. O great sage, Visnu was deluded by Kama by the power of Siva’s Maya. He outraged the modesty of other men’s wives many times.

18. Indra, the lord of the gods, became fascinated by Gautama’s wife. That vicious one committed sin and so was cursed by the sage.

19. Even the firegod, the most excellent in the universe was deluded by Siva’s Maya. Due to his pride he became subservient to lust and was ultimately saved by Siva.

20. The wind-god, the vital air of the universe was deluded by Siva’s Maya due to his arrogance. Overwhelmed by Kama, Vyasa too, had sexual intercourse with other men’s wives.

21. The sun of fierce rays, deluded by Siva’s Maya became lustful on seeing a mare and assumed the form of a horse.

22. The moon deluded by Siva’s Maya became lustful and abducted the wife of Brhaspati and had his sexual union with her. But he was finally saved by Brhaspati himself.

# 23.

Formerly the two gods Mitra and Varuna, while performing a severe penance, were fascinated and deluded by Siva’s Maya.

# 24.

On seeing the youthful maiden Orvasi, both of them had the emission of their semen. Mitra deposited his semen in a pot and Varuna in water.

# 25.

Vasistha was born out of the pot and is called Mitra’s son. Agastya born of Varuna has the lustre of the submarine fire.

# 26.

Daksa, son of Brahma deluded by Siva’s Maya, had a desire for sexual intercourse with his sister along with his other brothers.

# 27.

Many times, Brahma, deluded by Siva’s Maya, had the desire for sexual union with his own daughter and other women.

# 28.

Gyavana the great Yogin, deluded by Siva’s Maya, became lustful and had sexual dalliance with Sukanya.

# 29.

Katyapa became passionate on being deluded by Siva’s Maya. Formerly, out of delusion, he requested king Dhanvan to give his daughter to him.

# 30.

The deluded Garuda while abducting the virgin Sandill was found out by her and got his wings burnt.

# 31.

The sage Vibhandaka became lustful on seeing a woman. At the behest of Siva, Rsyasrriga was his son born of a hind.

# 32-33.

The sage Gautama had his mind deluded by Siva’s Maya. On seeing Saiadvatl in the nude he was excited and he indulged in sexual intercourse with her. He collected the semen emitted in a wooden bowl. Drona the foremost among marksmen was born of that bowl.

# 34.

The great yogin Parasara, deluded by Siva’s Maya, indulged in sexual intercourse with Matsyodari the virgin daughter of a fisherman.

# 35.

O Vyasa, Visvamitra became deluded by Siva’s Maya and lustfully indulged in sexual dalliance with Menaka.

According to the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Rsyasrnga, son of Vibhandaka, was born of a doe and had a small horn on his forehead.

36. Becoming confounded in thought he rivalled with Vasistha. But thanks to Siva’s grace he became a brahmin.

37. Ravana, the son of ViSravas, became lustful due to Siva’s Maya. The wicked-minded one abducted Sita, became deluded and courted death.

38. The excellent sage Brhaspati deluded by Siva’s Maya had sexual intercourse with his brother’s wife and Bharadvaja was born.

39. O Vyasa, thus the power of the Maya of Siva, the great soul has been narrated to you. What else do you wish to hear?

# CHAPTER FIVE

# (The Great Sins)

Vyasa said:

1. O holy lord, son of Brahma, obeisance be to you. Please describe those living beings who are engaged in sins causing their fall into great hells.

Sanatkumara said:

2. I describe to you in brief the living beings who are engaged in sins that cause their fall into great hells. Listen attentively.

3. Pondering over other men’s wives and wealth, wishing for the ill of others mentally, conception of various evil actions and ardent longing for various mean acts, these are the four types of mental activity.

4. Unconnected jabber, untruthful utterance, dis-

1472 Stoapur&#x26;na pleasing words and backbiting, these are the four types of verbal activity.

5. Eating forbidden food, violence, wild goose chase and pilfering of other’s property, these are the four types of physical activity.

6. Thus there are twelve types of activity intended to achieve three aims. I shall explain their further subdivisions, the results of which are endless and manifold.

7. Very great is the sin of those who hate lord Siva who enables people to cross the ocean of worldly existence. They are sure to be immersed in the ocean of hell.

8. Those who censure the propounder of Siva’s perfect knowledge, ascetics, preceptors or parents are mad. They fall into the ocean of hell.

9-10. The following six are the great sins attended with endless evil results, viz: — censure of Siva, censure of the preceptor, censure of Siva’s perfect knowledge, misappropriation of the wealth of the lord, destruction of the wealth of brahmins and the foolish stealing of the sacred text of Siva’s perfect knowledge.

11-22. The following too are great sins and those who commit them are great sinners. Those who do not take delight on seeing a well-arranged worship of Siva, who do not bow to or eulogise it on seeing his phallic image that is worshipped, those who do not scrub, clean and sanctify the spot of worship during festival days; those who do not duly cooperate with the preceptor in their sacred rites; those who misbehave as they please, play about mischievously and do not render service in front of Siva or in the presence of the preceptor; those who eschew Saiva course of conduct and discipline, those who hate Siva’s devotees; those who begin to study or write about Siva’s knowledge without worshipping; those who give without justice or justification; those who listen or recite indiscriminately; those who sport about covetously; those who pursue false knowledge or do not have proper rules and regulations; those who lie down and sleep in dirty uncleaned spots; he who abuses Siva’s story and knowledge and begins to expatiate on other things; he who does not speak the truth; he who does not

make gifts; he who is bodily impure and begins to explain or listen to Siva’s story in an unclean place; he who begins to listen without worshipping the preceptor; he who does not render service to him or pay heed to his behests with devotion; he who does not support the preceptor’s statement; he who retorts to his preceptor; he who conveniently ignores the most difficult task of his preceptor; he who deserts his preceptor when he is in distress, or when he is unable to maintain the disciple, or when he has gone abroad or when he is attacked by enemies; he who treats with contempt the teacher of virtuous activities and ability to discourse; he who disrespects the teacher’s wife, son or friends. O excellent sage, these activities are as sinful as censure of Siva.

23. The murderer of a brahmin, the addict to wine, the habitual thief, the defiler of the preceptor’s bed and he who associates with these is the great sinner fifth in all. 227

24. He who kills a brahmin out of fury, greed, fear or hatred or uses heart-rending taunts becomes the slayer of a brahmin.

25. He who invites a brahmin and makes him some gift but later on takes it back and criticises him and rebukes him without any fault is the slayer of a brahmin.

26. He who, being arrogant of his gift of learning, puts to shame any good brahmin keeping silence and indifferent in the assembly is also a brahmin-slayer.

27. He who pretends to have the qualities he does not have and gains recognition for the same and he who conceals his bad attributes is a brahmin-slayer.

28. He who hinders cow? when bulls mate with them or brahmins when they seek preceptors is called a brahmin-slayer.

29. He who forcibly occupies the land given in support of the temples, brahmins or cows, though the lease might have lapsed due to efflux of time, is called a brahmin-slayer.

30. The misappropriation of the wealth of the deity or

227. Cp. Mann 1 r.

1474 Sivapurdna

a brahmin and wealth earned through injustice is no less than the sin of slaying a brahmin undoubtedly.

31. If a brahmin learns the Vedas and acquires knowledge of Brahman and Siva, but eschews it later on he commits a sin equal to that of drinking wine.

32. The abandonment of sacred rites, worships and the five daily sacrifices, after performing the same for some time is attended with a sin equal to that of the drinking wine.

33-35. These are terrible sins like the murder of a brahmin: — abandonment of parents, perjury, lying to brahmins, flesh-eating in regard to the devotees of Siva, eating forbidden food, killing of innocent living beings in the forest, failure to use for charitable purpose the funds left by good men for the sake of brahmins and committing of arson in the forest or village or in the pathway of cows.

36-40. The following sins are equal to the theft of gold: — The forfeiture of the entire property of a poor man; the selling of these by a brahmin knowingly done except in a grave emergency — man, woman, elephant, horse, cow, land, silver, cloth, medicinal herbs, juices (or quicksilver) sandal paste, Aguru, camphor, musk, silk garments etc. and misappropriation of deposits kept in trust. The following are sins on a par with that of defiling teacher’s bed — the non-disposal of marriageable daughters by giving them in marriage to deserving husbands, having sexual intercourse with the wives of sons and friends or with the sisters, raping virgins; cohabitation with an intoxicated woman or a woman of one’s own caste. These are the great sins I have mentioned. Now listen to the minor sins.

Squeezing out their scrotum and those who make heifers draw carts are great sinners sure to fall into hell.

35-36. Those fools who do not take pity on guests, helpless persons, independent casual guests, children, old men, emaciated and sick persons overwhelmed by hunger, thirst and weariness and desirous of food surely go to hell.

37. The assets of a man take leave of him at the house itself as the kinsmen do at the cremation ground but his merits and sins follow wherever he goes.

38. The base brahmin who rears goats, sheep and buffaloes and who marries a Sudra woman and who lives on fishing etc. is a Sudra. If he follows the occupation of a Kshatriya he is sure to go to hell.

39. Sculptors, blacksmiths, physicians, goldsmiths and royal pretenders and deceitful servants are sure to go to hell.

40. The king who imposes improper taxes out of his own will and takes undue delight in punishment is tortured in hell.

41. The king whose subjects are harassed in the following way is tortured in hell. The way they are harassed may be due to bribery, favoritism of the officers and robbery.

42. There is no doubt that the brahmins who take monetary gifts from an unjust king fall into terrible hells.

43. The king who confiscates the properties of brahmins unjustly and passes them on to others certainly falls into hell.

54. Yama is the chastiser of all gods, human beings and animals engaged in evil practices. He chastises them by inflicting diverse terrible punishments.

55. For those who regularly observe restraints and disciplined life but who err slightly due to oversight, the preceptor is the chastiser through expiatory rites and not Yama as explained by learned men.

56. The king is the chastiser for outragers of others’ wives and thieves and unjust persons. But for those who are hidden Yama is the chastiser.

57. Hence one should perform expiatory rites for the commission of sins. If the sin is not consumed it will not perish even in hundreds of crores of Kalpas.

58. If the action is by oneself or through one’s incitement or instigation or if it is applauded by one later, physically, mentally or verbally he reaps the fruit of the sin.

# CHAPTER SEVEN

# (Pathway to Hell and the Emissaries of Yama)

Sanatkum&#x26;ra said:

1. As a result of the four kinds of sins, all living beings go to Yamaloka. They are helpless.

# 2.

It shall be known to all living beings whether in the womb, in the process of birth, as children, youth or middling whether women, man or a eunuch.

# 3.

Here the result of the auspicious and the inauspicious actions of all embodied beings is being considered by Citragupta Vasistha and others.

# 4.

There are no living beings who do not go to Yama’s abode. The result of the action must of necessity be undergone. Let that be considered.

# 5.

Men who have performed auspicious rites who are of gentle minds, endowed with the quality of compassion, go to Yama’s abode through the gentle entrance at the East.

# 6.

Sinners, habitually performing sinful actions and devoid of charitable nature, pass through the terrible path and enter Yama’s abode by the southern gate.

# 7.

It must be known that the multiformed city of Yama230 is situated at a distance of eighty-six thousand Yojanas from the Earth.

# 8.

To men of auspicious deeds it appears to be very near, but to the sinners who go along the terrible path it is situated far off.

# 9.

At places the path is strewn with sharp thorns, at places it is full of sand, elsewhere it is full of pebbles sharp like the razor-edge.

# 10.

Somewhere the place is marshy, somewhere full of long or short Darbha grass like iron pins that split the legs.

# 11.

Elsewhere it is full of mountains overgrown with trees and resembling impassable bunds. The distressed persons go along the path full of glowing coal.

# 12.

In other places it is full of deep irregular chasms and canyons, elsewhere, of rugged lumps of clay; of burning sands here and sharp spikes there.

Vaivasvatapura* the capital of Yama, is placed at the distance of eighty-six thousand Yojanas below this earth. Yama, the lord of the manes rules in the region called Yamaloka. Attended by thousands of his emissaries —Citragupta and others, he inflicts punishment upon the wicked. The chapter describes some frightful tortures suffered by the sinners.

13. Somewhere it is pervaded by bamboo groves with many branches spreading, elsewhere the path is enveloped in darkness, in some places the path has no support at all.

14. Somewhere the cross-roads are full of sharp iron pieces, elsewhere there is a forest-fire; in other places these are hot rocks; in some places snow spreads over it.

15. Some places are full of fine sand where the persons sink up to the neck; elsewhere it is full of stinking muddy water and some places are covered with burning balls of dry cowdung.

16. Different places are infested with different terrible beasts of prey such as lions, wolves, tigers or terrible mosquitoes or huge leeches.

17. Terrible flies, extremely poisonous serpents, herds of elephants in rut mad and mighty, crushing everything under their feet infest the paths.

18. The persons who go that way are tortured and harassed by big boars digging and butting against the path with their sharp fangs, buffaloes with sharp horns, all sorts of beasts of prey, terrible evil spirits like Dakinis, horrible Raksasas and pernicious diseases.

19. They are without any shelter when fierce gusts of wind raising huge columns of dust blow sharply against them or showers of massive stones smother them.

20. They go on, burnt and scorched by lightning falls and pierced through by heavy showers of arrows.

21. They are scorched and burnt by the showers of burning coal, the falling terrible thunderbolts and meteors.

22. They cry when heavy showers of dust envelop them. They tremble with fear ever and anon at the terrible rumbling sounds of massive clouds.

23. They are split by the shower of sharp weapons and drenched with acid-currents as they go on.

24. They shrink and wither when oppressed by the rough and chill wind all round.

25-28. All those foolish persons who habitually sin are led through such paths by the terrible emissaries of Yam forcefully, in carrying out his behests.— the paths that are terrible, devoid of feeding, devoid of basic support, im-

passable, lacking in water, rugged, desolate, dark and gloomy and full of pain and misery and all sorts of evil things.

29. They are lonely, devoid of friends and relatives. They are dependent on others. They bewail their evil actions. They cry again and again.

30. They have by this time become ghosts. They have no cloth on. Their throats, lips and palates are parched. They are frightened of terror. They are hungry and feel a burning sensation all over.

31. Some are bound with fetters and forced to keep their legs lifted up. They are dragged again and again by the extraordinarily powerful emissaries of Yama.

32. Others with downcast faces are against the chest. They are distressed. They are dragged with a rope fastened to their tresses.

33. Men in supine position are dragged along the thorny path or that covered with burning coal, by means of a goad clutching at their foreheads.

34. The hands of some are tied behind and they are hit in the belly. Others are completely bound with iron fetters. Still others are nailed in their hands.

35. A few others are dragged with a noose tied round their necks. They go ahead in distress. Others are dragged by ropes. Their tongues are pierced through by goads.

36. The noses of others are bored and ropes are tied through them and they are dragged. Similarly others have their cheeks and lips bored and are dragged by ropes.

37. The tips of the hands and the legs of some are cut off. The ears, noses and lips of others are cut. The penis and the scrotum of some are cut. A few others have all their limbs and joints cut.

38. Pushed, pierced and thrust by spears and arrows some run about helplessly here and there shrieking and squealing.

and sun and pierced through by javelins, some men shed putrid blood or evacuate faeces infested with worms. They are taken ahead thus.

# 41-42.

Those who had not made any charitable gifts in the world feel thirsty along this path and vainly beg for water, feeling hungry they beg for food; oppressed by sunshine they beg for shade and distressed with chillness they request for fire. They vainly beg for happiness. But those who had made charitable gifts in the world have all the food and drink necessary for this journey and go ahead to Yama’s abode happily.

# 43.

Having thus traversed the path they finally reach the city of the dead with great hardship. They are then ushered into the presence of Yama by the emissaries after due announcement.

# 44.

Yama welcomes with pleasure and due honour, all those who had performed auspicious rites in this world. He offers them padya and Arghya.

# 45.

Yama tells them — “You are noble souls duly blessed, since you have performed what is ordained in the Vedas. Good deeds that are conducive to divine happiness have been performed by you.

# 46.

Ascend the celestial aerial chariot and go to heaven to enjoy the pleasures in the company of celestial damsels and fulfil your cherished desires.

# 47.

After enjoying pleasures there, in the end when the merit is exhausted return to this place for reaping the fruit of what little evil you may have committed.”

# 48.

Men who have been virtuous are treated as friends by Yama. They see Yama with a gentle face.

# 49-53.

Men who have been guilty of cruelties see him in a terrible form. His face is terrible with curved fangs. His eyes are cruel with knit eyebrows. The hair on his head stand lifted up. He has a big moustache. His lips are pouted and they throb. He has eighteen hands. He is furious. He resembles black collyrium. His uplifted hands hold all weapons. He threatens with punishment. He is seated on a great buffalo. His eyes resemble blazing fire. He wears red garlands and garments. He is as tall as...

53. He appears ready to swallow even great mountains. He appears to vomit fire. Very near him is Mrtyu, whose lustre is like that of black fire.

54. Black in colour resembling collyrium he is very terrifying. Mari, Ugramahamari and Kalaratri are terrible spirits attending on Yama.

55. Various ailments, leprosies of various forms are terrible. They hold Saktis, tridents, goads, nooses, discuses and swords in their hands.

56. All of them are heroic and terrible. They have curved snouts. They bear shafts, quivers and bows and weapons of various sorts.

57. The attendants of Yama are innumerable. They arc great heroes. They have complexions like the black collyrium. They appear terrifying with weapons lifted up.

58. The sinners see Yama terrific to behold, surrounded by his attendants and they see Citragupta too equally terrible.

59. Yama rebukes and reproaches the sinners. Lord Citragupta enlightens them with statements on virtue.

committed by you all, for your own ruination? The actions committed by you shall be endured and the fruits thereof shall be reaped.

3. Why do you lament now? You are being tortured by your own actions. Reap the fruits thereof. This is not the fault of anyone else.

Sanatkumara said:

4-5. Similarly, the infuriated great lord Citragupta, the knower of virtuousness, at the behest and instruction of Yamaraja imparts the following advice to the kings who proud of their might had committed many misdeeds and had been brought near him ultimately.

Citragupta said:

6. O ye wicked kings, who had tyrannised over and repressed your subjects, why were misdeeds committed for your rule of a very short duration?

7. O kings, let the fruits be reaped now (of the evil actions) in having punished your subjects unjusticiably due to your fascination for kingly pleasures. You have misused your might.

8. Where is that kingdom? Where is your mistress? Where are those for whom sin and evil have been perpetuated? You have left them all and stand here alone.

9. I see that might quelled, the might that suppressed the subjects. How will you fare when you too are subjected to the same treatment by the emissaries of Yama?

Sanatkumara said:

10. The kings who are treated with these and other similar taunts by Yama bewail their own lot and stand silent.

11. After having proclaimed their evil actions, Yama, Dharmaraja speaks to the messengers thus, for wiping off the sins of those kings.

Tamardja said:

12. O Canda, O Mrihacanda, seize these kings forcibly and purify them grimly in the fires of hell.

# SivapurSna

Sanatkumdra said :

# 13-14.

Then they immediately catch hold of the kings by their feet, whirl them with great velocity, throw them up and when they fall they catch them again and dash them against a heated rock. They are thus felled like great trees smitten with the thunderbolt.

# 15.

Then the man sheds blood through his ears. He is wholly shattered. He becomes unconscious and motionless.

# 16.

When the wind blows against him he is resuscitated to life again. In order to purify him of his sins they throw him into the ocean of hell.

# 17.

At the end of the seventh nether-world Tala, there are twenty-eight Narakakotis situated in terrible darkness.

# 18.

The first cell is called Ghora. Sughora is situated beneath it. Atighora and Mahaghora come next and Ghorarupa is the fifth.

# 19.

The sixth is named Tala tala. The seventh is Bhayanaka. The eighth is Kalaratri and the ninth is Bhayotkata.

# 20-21.

The tenth beneath the previous is Gancja. Mahacanda is lower still. Candakolahala is another. Pracanda, Candanayika, Padma, Padmavatl, Bhita, Bhlma, Bhlsan nayika and Vajra are terrible, very terrible.

# 22.

The next eight cells are Trikona, Paficakona, Sudirgha, Akhilartida, Sama, BhTmabala, Atyugra and the eighth Diptapraya.

# 23.

Thus the cells of Naraka have been mentioned to you by their names. Each of these is meant for the torture for a particular sin. Thus the twenty-eight cells for twenty-eight types of sins.

# 24.

For each of these cells there are five officers-in charge. Now I shall mention the names of the hells of each of these cells. Understand them well.

# 25.

Raurava is the first where the embodied beings cry. Maharaurava is the next. Due to the tortures here even great men cry.

# 26-42.

There are cool and hot hells. The first five are the leading hells. The hells are named thus: Sughora, $umah&#x26;t3ks*a, Sanjivana, Mahatamas, Viloma, Vilopa.

43-45. Thus for twenty-eight cells there are five officers in charge of each. Raurava and other hells are thus hundred and more. The great zones of hell are forty hundreds. Thus O Vyasa, I have described the hells to you. The enumeration arouses detachment from the sin. Now listen to the pangs of sinners.

# CHAPTER NINE

# (Pangs of hell)

SanatkumSra said:

1. In the hellish fires, the sinners are roasted and dried up by diverse tortures till their action is exhausted completely.
2. Just as metals are melted in fire to remove their impurities so also sinners are put in hells in order to remove their sins.
3. The hands are tightly tied and the men are battered. Then they are suspended from the branches of tall trees by the attendants of Yama.
4. Then they are pushed by the servants till they begin to oscillate a Yojana unconscious by their rapidity.
5. Even as they are suspended in mid air, iron hundred Bharas in weight is tied to their feet by the emissaries of Yama.
6. Afflicted by such a heavy weight the sinners begin to think about their evil actions and keep quiet and motionless.
7. Then the sinners are beaten with goads of fiery colour and terrible iron rods by the terrible servants of Yama.
8. Then they are again smeared with glowing acid more unbearable than fire.
9. Their limbs are cut and smothered, gradually torn and severed and smeared with molten metal. They are then roasted like brinjal in red-hot iron cauldrons. They are then cast into wells full of filth, swarms of worms or in tanks full of putrid fat and blood. They are eaten by worm and crows with beaks strong as iron.
10. Dogs, mosquitoes, wolves and tigers of terrible and hideous faces too devour them. They are roasted like fish over glowing heaps of coal.
11. Due to their sinful actions men are pierced through with sharp spears. They are put in oil extracting machines called Cakra and crushed like gingelly seeds and beaten into pulp. They are fried in iron cauldrons red hot in the blazing sunlight.



---


15. They are fried in boiling oil in cauldrons again and again. Their tongues, chests and feet are struck in many ways.

16. Here the tortures to the body are very severe. Men thus go from one hell to another and are tortured in all the hells.

17. O Vyasa, terrible tortures are inflicted in diverse ways in all the hells by Yama’s emissaries. They are grievous and painful to every part of the body.

18-19. Their mouths are filled with the burning coals and again with acid red hot, copper hot clarified butter and oil and they are beaten afterwards.

20. They are filled with faeces and worms and are forced to embrace the red hot fierce iron-silk cotton tree.

21-22. They are then beaten on the back with heated hammer. Their heads and their limbs are crushed with too blunt tooth-edged strong scissors. They are thus tortured by their own actions. Their flesh is eaten and their blood is drunk by them.

23. Those who fed and nurtured only themselves and never made any gift of food or drink are crushed with iron rods like sugarcane.

24. In the terrible hell Asitalavana they are cut into pieces. Their limbs are pierced through with needles. They are staked on to heated spearheads.

25. Tossed about many times their bodies do not perish but are severely pained. They become used to bear the pleasure or pain.

26. Flesh is torn off their bodies and they are pounded with iron clubs of tooth-edged shapes by terribly mighty emissaries of Yama.

27. In the hell Nirucchvasa they are forced to stand without breathing, for a long time. In the hell Ucchvasa they are hit and thrashed in a house of sand.

28. In the hell Raurava they are made to cry and inflicted pain by various tortures. Due to the tortures in the hell, Maharaurava, even great men cry.

29. They are beaten on the faces, feet anus, skull,



---


1490

Eyes and forehead with blocks of iron and sharp-edged redhot iron spikes.

30. They are again and again rolled on hot sand. Cast into boiling marsh of creatures they make harsh shrieking sounds.

31. O sage, in the hell kumbhipaka sinners of ruthless misdeeds are fried in unbearable boiling oil.

32. The sinners are celled and dragged along various torturing places again and again in the hell named Lalabhak$a.

33. Sinners devoid of merit are beaten by Yama’s servants. They are hurled into the torturous hell Suclmukha.

34. They are put into iron pots. They breathe hard and slow. They are scorched by great fire, as if by their own sins.

35. They are tied tightly with ropes and are rolled on rocks and harassed. They are cast into deep gloomy wells. They are subjected to bee-bites.

36. When their bodies are cut, bitten and gnawed by worms in a hundred places, they are hurled into wells of pungent acid.

37. In the blazing hell the distressed sinners, shriek and run about here and there scorched by its flames.

38-39. People are clubbed and tied together with mouths resting on shoulders and hands brought through the hollow and tied with nooses and ropes to the back. Such bundles of bodies are seen in the Mahajvala undergoing tortures.

40. They are tied with ropes, smeared with mud and scorched in husk and cowdung fire but do not perish.

41. Dragged and rolled through rough and coarse rocks, beaten and burnt like straw, the sinners of ruthless conduct, are tortured.

42-43. The worms eat through their bodies with their sharp mouths and teeth. With their bodies gradually hurled over swarms of worms, heaps of putrid flesh and bones they stay there distressed, dejected and crushed between two mountains.

44. They are kept with face down and legs up and



---


scorched in fire. Their bodies are smeared with hot adamantine solution.

45. Red hot iron clubs are thrust into their mouths. They are helplessly forced to gnaw at it. They are then beaten with iron threshing rods.

46. O Vyasa, thus the sinners of misdeeds are cooked and scorched in hells. I shall now describe their various modes of undergoing the tortures of hell.

# CHAPTER TEN

# (The mode of sufferings in the Hell)

Sanatkumara said:

1. He who follows false scriptures goes to the hell Dvijihva. He is tortured by the tongue-like ploughshares extending to one and a half kilometres.

2. The mouth of the man who had been cruel to his parents and had reproached them is filled with faeces and worms and he is beaten.

3-5. Men who defile the temple of Siva, the park surrounding it and the wells, tanks and lakes therein, in various ways such as playing there, applying oil and unguents over the body, drinking bouts, taking food, indulgence in sexual intercourse, game of dice etc. are tortured by being crushed in the sugarcane-crushing machine and other mechanical contrivances. They are scorched in hellish fire till the final day of dissolution.

6. Sinners who indulge in illicit union with other’s wives are forced to embrace red-hot iron images of those women with whom they had illicit relation and struck in various ways.

7. Images of those men are made of red hot iron and the erring women are forced to embrace those images. They cry and shriek.

8-10. Those who listen to the censure of good people are punished thus: ears filled with red hot pins of



---


iron, copper, tin, lead or brass, or with boiling milk or oil or adamantine liquid again and again. The tortures in the hells are inflicted by filling the ears with these and other parts one after the other. The procedure here too is the same as in the case of ears.

# 1

Similar tortures are inflicted on all the organs of the body with which the acts of sin had been committed.

# 12

The hands of those sinners who touch other’s wives are filled with red hot fillings.

# 13

Their bodies are smeared with corrosive substances such as acid etc. Tortures are acute and grievous in all the hells.

# 14

The faces of men who show wry faces with knit eye-brows to their parents are scratched from end to end with sharp pikes.

# 15

The organs wherewith men defile or harass women are respectively tortured.

# 16

If they had looked at other women with greedy gaping eyes, red hot needles are stuck in their eyes.

# 17

O excellent sage, it is true, true. There is no doubt. Tortures of Yama by acids etc. take place here itself in the hells.

# 18

If people take food without first offering it to the gods, firegod, preceptors and brahmins, their tongues and mouths are pierced through and filled with hundreds of red-hot nails of iron.

# 19-20

If men, out of greed, pluck and sniff at flowers of the temple parks, or wear them on their heads, their heads are covered with iron spikes and their noses are filled with plenty of acid and other things.

# 21-23

Red-hot three-pointed iron rods are thrust and pushed through the chest, neck, tongue, tooth-joints, palate, lips, nostrils and all the limb-joints of those persons who slander and censure the noble-preacher of virtue, devotees of the gods, fire-god and preceptor as well as the eternal scriptural texts.

232. Adorning the locks of hair is the common characteristic of the people of Dak?in^patha across the Narmada river. This practice never prevailed among North Indian people.



---


24. The crevices of the body are filled with corrosive acid. Severe tortures are inflicted all over the body.

25-26. Those who take other’s wealth or kick or even touch a brahmin with their legs go from hell to hell serially. Those who touch illegally or stamp with the foot the materials for Siva’s worship, cow, or a Manuscript in which words of wisdom are written, are tortured by filling (as mentioned before).

27. In all hells various tortures of grievous nature are inflicted on hands and feet.

28-30. If sinners evacuate their bowels or pass urine near Siva’s temple or in the premises of the lord's parks their penis along with the scrotum is pounded into powder by iron-threshing rods. Red hot needles are stuffed into his anus and penis. Acute corrosive acid or molten metals are poured into them.

31-32. As a result of the previous tortures their minds and all sense-organs are put to great misery. Those who, despite being rich do not make monetary gifts due to greed, and those who dishonour guests visiting their houses at the proper time, commit sins and fall into dirty hell.

33-34. Those who take food before offering oblations to dogs and crows are tortured by beating two nails into their open mouths. They are further harassed through worms, fierce living beings and by means of crows with iron beaks. Various other sorts of tortures too are in store for them.

35-40. He who is dark and he who is multi-coloured these two are the obstacles to the path of Yama. To these two dogs I am offering this oblation. Let them take this oblation. Let the pious crows in the direction of Vanina (west), of Vayu (north-west), of Yama (south) and of Nairrti (south-west), accept this oblation of mine”. Those who offer this Bali with Siva’s mantras, after worshipping Siva with devotion and performing Homa duly, do not face Yama. They go straight to heaven. Hence this oblation shall be offered daily. A square mystic diagram is made and sweet

233 - The text mentions the two dogs and crows to whom the offerings shall be made in favour of the departed spirit. It mentions the cow that takes the spirits across Vaitara^l.

# Aivapurfya

Scents are offered. The oblation to Dhanvantari is made in the Igana corner (north-east); that to Indra in the east; that to Yama in the south; that to Siva with Dak$a and Uma in the west; that to the Pitrs in the south; that to Aryaman in the east and to Dhatr and Vidhatr at the entrance.

41-4-4. The offerings to dogs and lords of dogs and to the crows are made on the ground. A householder is depended upon by the gods, Pitrs, ghosts, all sorts of living beings, Guhyakas, birds, worms and insects. The four nipples of the cow are respectively Svahakara, Svadhakara, Vasatkara and Hantakara. The Svahakara nipple is sucked by gods; the Svadhakara by the manes, the Vasatkara by the other gods as well as lords of the Bhutas and the Hantakara nipple is drunk by human beings.

45-46. He who serves the cow thus with faith and reverence deserves to maintain the sacrificial fires. He who forsakes it is drowned in the hell Tamisra. Hence after offering Bali to these at the door, the householder shall meditate for a short while.

47. One shall feed the hungry guest staying in the same village with auspicious food, in accordance with his ability and with the same dishes as he partakes of himself.

48. If a guest turns back from a house disappointed he takes away all the merits of the householder and leaves his own sins behind.

49. A man eating delicious food by himself stays in the hell for a long time fettered in the body and pierced in the tongue with force.

50-51. Bits of his own flesh, of the size of a small gingelly seed, are cut off from his body and are given to him for eating. Blood is similarly taken and given for drinking. He is then beaten with whips. Thus he is tormented with hunger and thirst.

52. These and similar things constitute the terrible.

234. The gifts offered to the principal gods, manes, subsidiary gods, and human beings with the utterance of words WT, and are likened to the milk-drops from the four teats of the cow.

tortures inflicted on sinners. What comes off in the end may be listened to in brief.

53. There may be a person who has done more sin than good or a person who has done more good than evil. Now listen to the result of their actions.

54. The fruit of good actions is immaterial because it is the sin that is prominent. His pleasure is insignificant since he has to undergo manifold suffering due to his bad deeds.

55. He is put to misery and distress. As sumptuous food is not pleasing to a person if that is not repeated every day so his small joys are of no avail in the face of various sufferings he has to undergo.* ,B

56. On the other hand a man of more good actions is not distressed by a few sufferings due to small sins just as a rich householder is not distressed by hunger when he fasts for a day.

57. There are great sins in the world which shatter a man into hundreds of pieces like a mountain struck down by thunderbolt.

Vy&#x26;sa said:

1. Those who commit sins go along the path to Yama with great misery. O holy lord, now narrate the righteous deeds which render pleasure in the path of Yama.

Sanatkumdra said:

2. Auspicious or inauspicious, one has of necessity to reap the fruit of actions committed by him without thinking. I shall now mention those sacred rites that yield happiness.

3. Men who perform auspicious rites here, whose minds are gentle and who are merciful pass through the terrible path of Yama happily.

4. He who makes gifts of sandals of leather or wood to leading brahmins goes happily to the abode of Yama on a great horse.

5. By making gifts of umbrella they go holding an umbrella. By making gifts of palanquin he goes by means of a chariot.

6. By making gifts of beds and seats he goes with ample rest. Those who make shady parks or those who plant trees on the wayside go without weariness even in the hottest region.

7. Men making flower gardens go by the aerial chariot Puspaka. Makers of temples feel at home on the way.

8. The founders of hermitages of ascetics and rest houses for the orphans feel as if they play in the house.

9. Worshippers of the gods, fire-god brahmins and their parents go along that path as they please. They are honoured on the way.

10. Those who gift lamps, go brightly illuminating all the ten quarters. By giving dwellings and asylums they go without ailments on the way.

11. Those who habitually serve their preceptors go without difficulty. They get ample rest on the way. Those who gift musical instruments to brahmins go happily feeling at home on the way.

12. Givers of cows go along the path flourishing with all their desires. They get those food-stuffs and drinks which they give away here, on that path also.

13. By giving water for washing the feet one goes along the path full of water. He who gifts oils for massaging the feet goes on horseback along that way.

14. O Vyasa, Yama never comes near the man who always makes gifts of water for washing the feet, oil for massaging, lamps, foodstuffs and dwellings.

15. By making gifts of gold and gems he crosses all impassable hurdles. By gifting silver and oxen he goes to Yamaloka happily.



---


# 16.

By these and similar charitable gifts people go happily to Yama’s abode. They attain different pleasures in the heaven.

# 17.

Of all charitable gifts the gift of food is the greatest. It is pleasing. It gives pleasure immediately. It enhances strength and intellect.

# 18.

O excellent sage, there is no other charitable gift on a par with the gift of food. All living beings originate from food. In its absence they die.

# 19.

Food gives blood, flesh, fat and semen and out of semen living beings are born. Hence the universe is identical with food.

# 20.

Hungry men are not delighted even if they possess these things viz —gold, gems, horses, elephants, women, garlands, sandal paste and the like.

# 21.

All persons, the child in the womb, the new born babe, the child, the middle aged man, the old man, the gods, the danavas or Raksasas desire food.

# 22.

Hunger is the acutest of all ailments. There is no doubt that it perishes on the application of the medicinal ointment viz food.

# 23.

There is no misery equal to hunger; no sickness equal to hunger; no happiness on a par with being free from sickness and no enemy equal to anger.

# 24.

All embodied beings die when scorched by the fire of hunger. That is why it is glorified that there is great merit in the charitable gift of food.

# 25.

The giver of food is the giver of life. The giver of life is the giver of all. Hence one attains the benefit of gifting everything by means of the charitable gift of food.

# 26.

If a man performs holy and sacred rites after being nourished with the food gifted by someone, the merit of the sacred rites is shared half and half by the two—namely by the giver of food and the performer of the rites. There is no doubt in this.

# 27.

The giver of charitable gift of food obtains here and hereafter whatever means of pleasure there are in the three worlds such as gems, women and vehicles.

# 28.

This body is the greatest of the means of achieve-

1498

ment of virtue, wealth, love and salvation. Hence one should preserve one’s body with food and drink.

# 29.

They praise only food. Everything is founded on food. There has never been a charitable gift like that of food, nor will there ever be any.

# 30.

O sage, the entire universe is sustained by food. It is food that infuses virility in the people. The vital airs are founded on food.

# 31.

Even by putting one’s family to inconvenience and trouble one should give food to a mendicant brahmin of noble soul, if one wishes for one’s prosperity.

# 32.

He who gives food to a suppliant brahmin in distress actually makes an excellent deposit facilitating his benefit in the other world.

# 33.

A householder, desirous of prosperity shall worship a brahmin who has approached him at the proper time for his livelihood, or who is travel-weary and comes to his house as a guest. O Vyasa, a giver of good conduct

# 34-35.

A food, of free from malice, is honoured. gift of food never goes in vain be it to a dog or a person who cooks dogs. If a person eschews anger that surges up he derives happiness here and hereafter. He should not encourage it even if it is natural. One shall try to eschew it somehow.

# 36.

He who gives food to a weary, unknown traveller, without feeling distressed for the same will derive prosperity.

# 37.

The meritorious benefit of the man, O great sage, who delights Pitrs, gods, brahmins and guests with food-stuffs, in really immense.

# 38.

Gift of food and drink whether to a Sudra or to a brahmin is equally excellent. One should not ask the spiritual lineage,

236 branch of the Vedas

237 or the country of the recipient.

# 39.

He who gives food when begged by a brahmin, goes to the highest heaven and remains there till the final

# 40.

The garden of a food-giver acquires the fruits of his cherished desire as the brahmins do in the highest heaven. O sage, O great sage, listen to the divine regions which are created in the heaven by the gifts of food, for the giver of food.

# 41.

The abodes of those noble souls in the heaven shine in various shapes and are equipped with every desirable object.

# 42.

The trees bear the fruits of all desires. The golden lakes in the mansions, the auspicious wells and tanks are all excellent.

# 43.

The auspicious drinks of various varieties are proclaimed. There are huge mountains of food-stuffs, garments and ornaments.

# 44.

Milk flows in rivers there. There are huge mountains of ghee. The palaces are white in colour. Beds are brilliant like gold.

# 45.

The giver of food goes to these regions. One should be a giver of food if one wishes for one’s own good in this or in the other world.

# 46.

These regions of the meritorious givers of food are very brilliant. Hence food shall be given as a gift by the people.

# 47.

Food is Brahma himself. Food is Vi$nu himself. Food is Siva. There has never been nor will there ever be a gift on a par with that of food.

# 48.

Even after committing a great sin if a man gives food to the needy he becomes rid of all sins. He goes to heaven.

# 49.

The eight gifts are honoured most in the land of the dead viz food, drink, horse, cow, garments, bed, umbrella and seat.

# 50.

If a man wishes to go to the city of Yama in the aerial chariot, he shall necessarily make these special gifts.

# 51.

This sacred narrative gives instances of the virtue of gifts of foodstuffs; whoever reads this or teaches this to others flourishes indeed.



---


O great sage, if a person listens to this or narrates this at the performance of Sraddha to brahmins, it results in a never-ending gift of food to the Pitrs.

# CHAPTER TWELVE

# (The glory of penance)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. The gift of drink is the greatest and the most excellent of all gifts. Water the enlivener is the most satisfying to all living beings.
2. Hence one should make gifts of drinking water-sheds lovingly and unrestrictedly. Making of water bases, tanks etc. is the cause of great bliss.
3. It is truthful, really truthful. There is no doubt in this, here and hereafter. Men should cause tanks, wells and lakes to be dug therefore.
4. A well that abounds in water removes half of the sin of the man who causes it to be dug.
5. If cows drink and good men and brahmins make use of the water in a water-base dug by a man, the whole family is redeemed.
6. If there is plenty of water in the water-base dug by a man, during summer, he never suffers distress or mishaps at any time.
7. I shall mention the benefits of lakes dug by men. He who has a lake to his credit is honoured in all the three worlds.
8. Or the digging of lakes is conducive to the advent of fame and attainment of friendship in the abode of the sun but without distressing heat.
9. He who digs a lake attains an endless merit. The wise say that it is the fruit of virtue, wealth and love.
10. The lake is the greatest resort of the four classes of living beings. The construction of the lake etc. indicates excellent glory.



---


# 11.

The gods, human beings, Gandharvas, Pitj-s, serpents, Rak?asas and the immobile beings depend upon water bases.

# 12.

Brahma says that the benefit of the sacred rite Agnihotra is derived by a man in the lake dug by whom there is plenty of water in the rainy season.

# 13.

There is no doubt at all in this that the benefit of gifting away a thousand cows is derived by a man, in the lake dug by whom there is plenty of water in the Autumn.

# 14.

If there is plenty of water in the lake dug during the seasons of early winter and late winter, he derives the benefit of that sacrifice in which plenty of gold is given as a sacrificial gift.

# 15.

If there is plenty of water in the lake dug during the seasons of Spring and Summer, the wise say that he derives the benefit of the holy rites of Atiratra and A$va-medha sacrifices.

# 16.

O sage Vyasa, the merit accruing from the digging of water bases, excellent and pleasing to all living beings, has been narrated to you. Now listen to the merits of planting trees.

# 17.

If a man plants trees in the forests, he enables his ancestors and the successors of his family, to gain redemption. Hence one should plant trees.

# 18.

There is no doubt that these trees become his sons. When he goes to the other world he attains the un-dying regions.

# 19.

Trees honour and worship the gods through flowers, the Pitfs through fruits, and the guests through shade.

# 20.

The Kinnaras, the serpents, the Raksasas, the gods, the Gandharvas, the human beings and the sages depend upon trees.

# 21.

While in bloom or when they bear fruits, the trees delight human beings. They are as sons by way of virtue in this world and hereafter.

# 22.

These people never fail to attain heaven viz. the digger of lakes, the planter of trees, the brahmin who performs sacrifices and those who speak truth.

It is a part of tin' Jyotisjomn

# 23.

Truth alone is the great Brahman, the greatest penance, the greatest sacrifice and the greatest learning.

# 24.

When others sleep, truth is wakeful. Truth is the greatest base, it is truth alone by which the earth is sustained, everything is founded in truth.

# 25.

Penance, sacrifice, merit, the worship of the gods, sages and the Pitrs, the Waters, the Vidyas—all these things are established in truth.

# 26.

Truth is sacrifice, penance, charitable gift, mantras, goddess Sarasvati, celibacy and Oihkara. These are really truth.

# 27.

It is truth whereby the wind blows, the sun blazes, the fire burns and the heaven is upheld.

# 28.

By upholding truth the people can attain the benefits of keeping up the traditions of all the Vedas and taking the ceremonial ablutions in all holy centres.

# 29.

When weighed against truth in a balance, a thousand horse-sacrifices and a hundred thousand other sacrifices do not equal it. Truth alone excels.

# 30.

The gods, the Pitrs, the human beings, the serpents, the Rakshasas and the worlds including the mobile and immobile beings are delighted by Truth.

# 31.

They say that Truth is the greatest virtue, the greatest region, the greatest Brahman; hence one shall tell the Truth always.

# 32.

After performing very difficult penance, it is by depending solely on Truth, by maintaining truthful virtue that the sages have attained Siddhis and reached heaven.

# 33.

The sages have attained heaven travelling in aerial chariots along with the celestial damsels. Truth shall be ever spoken, for there is nothing greater than Truth.

# 34.

In the deep, extensive and pure eddy, the holy centre of Truth, one shall mentally take one’s ceremonial ablution. That is said to be the highest bliss.

# 35.

Men who never utter a lie whether for their own sake, or for other’s sake, or even for their own son’s sake, do go to heaven.

# 36.

The Vedas, the sacrifices and the Mantras exist in

brahmins for ever. They are never visible to the untruthful. Hence one shall always speak truth.

# Vydsa said:

37. O ascetic, please explain again with special emphasis on the fruit of penance for the brahmins as well as other castes.

# Samtkumdra said:

38. I shall explain the section on penance which is the means of achieving all the objects of desire, very difficult to be performed even by brahmins. Please listen even as I explain.

39. Penance is the greatest rite. Fruits are achieved by penance. Those who are engaged in penance incessantly rejoice along with the gods.

40. Heaven, fame and love are achieved through penance. Penance is the means of achievement for all objects.

41. One achieves great things through penance. One attains salvation, knowledge, perfect wisdom, good fortune and beauty by penance.

42. Man obtains different things through penance; he gets everything, whatever he wishes in his mind through penance.

43. Those who have never performed penance do not attain Brahmaloka; lord Siva is not accessible to those who have never performed penance.

44. After deciding on a particular thing, if a man performs penance he attains it here as well as hereafter.

45. The wine-addict, the defiler of other women, the brahmin-slayer, the defiler of teacher’s bed overcome all sins through penance and get rid of them.

46-47. Siva, the lord of all, the eternal Vi?gu, Brahma, fire god, Indra and others are endowed with penance. The eighty-eight thousand sages of sublimated semen rejoice in heaven through penance, along with the gods.

48. Kingdoms are achieved through penance. Indra,

1504 Sivapur&#x26;Qa the lord of gods and the slayer of Vftra, protects everything day by day through penance.

49. Due to penance, the lords Sun and the Mqoii are engaged in the welfare of the worlds. The stars and the planets too shine by virtue of their penance.

50. There is no happiness in the world that can be gained without penance. The knowers of the Vedas understand that all happiness is attained through penance alone.

51. Knowledge, perfect wisdom, health, beauty, good fortune and perpetual happiness are the offshoots of penance.

52. It is by penance that Brahma creates the universe; Visnu protects it without any strain; Siva annihilates and Se?a upholds the entire earth.

53. O great sage, the Ksatriya king Visvamitra, the son of Gadhi, became a brahmin through penance. This is well known in the three worlds.

54. O intelligent one, thus the excellent glory of penance has been mentioned to you. Now listen to the glory of the study of the Vedas which is far more excellent than penance itself.

# CHAPTER THIRTEEN

# (The glory of the Pur&#x26;Qas)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. O sage, the fruit is the same whether one performs penance in a forest restricting his diet to roots and fruits there or studies a single Vedic verse.

238. The sage VUvamitra was the son of Gathin or G&#x26;dhi of the Kusika race descended from Kusika. He is called G&#x26;dhi-ja and Gidhi-nandana. He was born a ksatriya but by intense austerities raised himself to the Brahmaga caste and became one of the seven great sages.

# 1505

2. By teaching the Veda, an excellent brahmin attains twice the merit that he attains by studying it.

3. The universe will go without light if the moon and the sun were not present. The same will happen if the Puranas too, O sage, were not.

4. A Puranist enlightens the people through Sastras, the people who are in distress in the hell due to ignorance. Hence he shall be worshipped.

5. Among all the deserving men the knower of Purana is the most excellent. He is considered worthy because he saves people from fall.

6. Never shall a Puranist be considered an ordinary man. A preceptor proficient in Purana is omniscient. He is Brahma, Vishnu and Siva.

7. For the welfare here and hereafter, wealth, food-grain, gold, different clothes etc. shall be given to a Puranist as gift.

8. The good man who out of pleasure gives auspicious things to a Puranist who is a deserving person, attains the greatest salvation.

9. Listen to the merit that a person derives from lands, cows, chariots, elephants and good horses to a deserving person.

10. That man derives the fruit of horse-sacrifice, and realises all his cherished desires without wastage, both here and hereafter.

11. He who gives him a good fertile and well ploughed land facilitates the redemption of the members of his family upto ten generations before him and after him.

12. After enjoying all the pleasures here, he becomes endowed with a divine body on death and goes to Sivaloka, by a divine aerial chariot.

13. The gods are not satisfied so much with sacrifices, Prok?anakas (immolations of animals at the sacrifices), oblations and floral worships as with the recitation of books.

14. Listen to the meritorious benefits of that man who...



---


# 1506

Makes arrangement for the Sacred Text book in the temple of Siva, Vi$nu, the Sun or any one else.

15. The man derives the benefit of Rajasuyas39 and Aivamedhas. Piercing through the sun’s sphere he goes to the Brahmaloka.

16. After remaining there for hundreds of Kalpas he becomes a king on the earth. He enjoys the pleasures without pinpricks. No hesitation need be entertained in this regard.

17. He who performs Japas in front of the deity obtains that benefit which is mentioned as the fruit of a thousand horse-sacrifices.

18. Nothing else is delightful to Siva and the heaven-dwellers more than the recitation of Itihasas and Puranas in the auspicious temples of Siva.

19. Hence arrangements shall be assiduously made for the reciting of the book. Listening to it with devotion and love yields the fruit of all cherished desires.

20. Man becomes free from sins on listening to Siva-purana. After enjoying immense pleasures he attains the world of Siva.

21. Merely by listening to the story of Siva one derives the merit similar to that resulting from Rajasuya and a hundred Agni?toma rites.

22. O sage, by listening to the story of Siva one derives the benefit and merit derived from ablution in the sacred rivers and from gifting away a crore of cows.

23. Those who constantly listen to Siva’s story that sanctifies the worlds are not mere human beings, they are Rudras. There is no doubt in this.

24. Sages consider the dust in the lotus-feet of those

39 Rajasuya is a great sacrifice celebrated in the £rautasfitras. It was performed at the coronation of a king. The sacrifice of a horse was performed by Kings. It was an exercise for attaining sovereignty of the world. The horse was let loose to wander at will for a year. The king or his representative followed the horse with an army. When the horse entered a foreign country, the ruler of that country was bound either to fight or submit.

# 1507

Who listen to the holy glory of Siva and those who constantly glorify it to be as holy as the holy centres.

25. Let those embodied beings who desire to attain salvation listen always to the Puranic story of Siva with devotion.

26. If any one is unable to listen to the Puranic story let him listen at least for a Muhurta every day with pure mind.

27. O sage, if any man is unable to listen to the story of Siva every day let him listen to it in the course of holy months, days etc.

28. O great sage, he who regularly listens to Siva’s story crosses the ocean of worldly existence after burning away the great forest of Karman.

29. No mishap befalls those men who listen to Siva’s story even for a Muhurta, or half that time or even for a moment with devotion.

30. O sage, certainly the fruit derived from listening to Sivapurana is the same as that derived from making all charitable gifts or from performing all sacrifices.

31. O Vyasa, especially in the age of Kali there is no greater virtue aimed at salvation and meditation than listening to the Puranas.

32. There is no doubt that the listening to Siva-Purana and the holy recital of his names yield fruits readily like the Kalpa tree to human beings.

33. Siva has created the nectarine juice in the form of Purana for the benefit of men of poor intellect in the Kali age who have eschewed virtue and good conduct.

34. Only one person becomes free from old age and death by drinking the nectar Amrita. But by drinking the nectarine story of Siva the entire family becomes free from death and old age.

35. O dear, one instantaneously attains by listening to the Puranas that salvation which men, tenacious ascetics and performers of sacrifices derive.

36. As long as perfect knowledge is not attained, Yogastras shall be learnt assiduously and the Puranic text be listened to.

37. By listening to the sin is...



---


eliminated; virtue is enhanced; and the wise man does not re-enter worldly life,

38. Hence indeed, the Puranas shall be assiduously listened to for the achievement of virtue, wealth, love and salvation.

39. Man attains, thanks to listening to the Puranas, that benefit which is attained by sacrifices, charitable gifts, penances and pilgrimages.

40. If there be no purana showing the path of Dharma, there will be no person observing Vrata or interested in the life hereafter.

41. He who listens to at least one among the thirty six Puranas or reads it with devotion is liberated. There is no doubt in this.

42. No other path so pleasing is there. The path of the Puranas is the most excellent. Nothing in the world shines without the &#x26;astra as the worlds of living beings without the sun.

# CHAPTER FOURTEEN

# (General charitable gifts)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. Ten charitable gifts are called great gifts and are praiseworthy. They shall be given to deserving persons every day. They enable the soul to cross the ocean of worldly existence. The charitable gifts of gold, cow and land, O excellent brahmin, are very holy. Those who make them redeem themselves.

2. There are gifts of gold, cows and land, by making these excellent gifts one is liberated from sins.

3. Tuladanas are highly praised like the gifts of cows.

240. The printed Sanskrit text is defective. Substitute fsftnfo for for the number of the TurS^as and UpapurSnas together is thirty-six and not twenty-six.



---


Gifts of lands and of speech are of equal potency and deserve praise. But gifts of speech shall be greater.

5. These things shall be given everyday to those who beg for them—viz. oxen, cows, umbrella, cloth, pairs of shoes, drink and food.

6. An object which is given to brahmins, suppliants and distressed people after performing the Samkalpa rites enables the donee to become greatly intelligent.

7. There are ten great gifts—viz. gold, gingelly seeds, elephants, virgins, servant-maid, house, chariot, jewels, the tawny coloured cow and ordinary cows.

8. After taking all these a brahmin of great wisdom enables the donee to cross the ocean of worldly existence as well as himself.

9. If men make gifts of gold with pious mind, the gods bestow the same on him. Thus I have heard.

10. Gold is fire. Indeed fire represents all gods. Hence by making the gift of gold one makes the gift of all gods.

11. Gift of lands is very excellent and it yields the fruits of all desires. The gift of gold is also excellent and it was made by king Pfthu formerly.

12. If plots of lands are given along with gold it is praiseworthy. They become liberated from all sins and attain the greatest goal.

13. O sage, I shall mention another gift which is the most excellent and whereby people do not see the forest of Yama, the cause of many miseries.

14. One shall make the charitable gift of forest with due observance of rules and pious mind. The wealth shall be earned by justiciable means. The donee shall be devoid of stinginess associated with affluence.

15-19. With a Prastha measure of gingelly seeds an image of a cow endowed with all qualities shall be made. The calf shall be made of gold. It shall be divine in shape and it shall possess all characteristics. The mystic diagram of the eight-petalled lotus shall be made with auspicious Vermillion and raw rice grains. The devotee shall worship Rudra and all other gods there with great devotion. After the worship the cow and the calf shall be given to a brahmin along with



---


gems and gold according to ability and bedecked too in all ornaments. The devotee shall take food only in the night. He shall then make elaborate gifts of lamps. This shall be done on the full moon day in the month of Karttika strenuously. He who does thus according to his ability but strictly observing the rules does not see the terrible hell or the path of Yama. O Vyasa, even committing the man after sins, enjoys in the heaven along with his kinsmen and friends as long as fourteen Indras rule over it.

The gift of the cow duly performed is the most excellent. O Vyasa, no other gift is glorified so much as this.

If any one makes the gift of a tawny cow along with its calf adorning the horns with gold, the hoofs with silver and endowed with other characteristics and also gives a bell metal vessel, that cow returns to him in the form of the wish-yielding celestial cow. O Vyasa, the donee is thus blessed both here and hereafter.

One shall make gifts of such things to a man of good qualities, such thing as he likes most in the world, as are very dear to him in the house and as are wished for by him to be his permanent possessions.

Gift of anything equal in weight to the giver is the most excellent of all gifts. If he wishes for his prosperity he shall ascend the weighing balance.

The weighing balance is highly meritorious. It eliminates all sins. On making the gift of it one gets rid of sins arising from slaughter and captivity.

Even after committing sins if a man makes the gift of weighing balance he becomes free from all sins and goes to heaven.

(The following shall be recited before making the gift) “May the presiding deity of the weighing balance remove the sin committed by me physically, mentally or verbally during the day, night, the twilights, midday, the close of the night or in any of the three times. May the presiding deity of the balance, lord Siva, enemy of the cupid, remove all the sins done by me, whether as a boy or a



---


Vmisaihhiti 1511

youth, or an old man wakefully and consciously. Wealth has been consigned by me to a deserving person. It has been deposited in the balance according to my weight. May merit accrue to me along with this.

31. The presiding deity shall be made after reciting the above formula. It shall not be given to a single person. There is no benefit in it. It shall be distributed among many brahmins. O Vyasa, he who makes excellent of the presiding deity of the balance destroys his sins and attains heaven. He stays there as long as the fourteen Indras rule over it.

# CHAPTER FIFTEEN

# (Description of the Nether worlds)

Vyasa said:

1. For the benefit of human beings tell me that which when given as gift makes it possible to derive the benefit of all gifts.

Sanatkumara said:

2. Listen. I shall mention that gift on giving which, at the proper time, men obtain the benefit of all the gifts.

3. This is the most excellent of all gifts. The whole universe shall be given as gift by those who desire salvation for crossing the ocean of worldly existence.

4. A man becomes the lord of the seven worlds, with a fraction of the benefit that he obtains when the whole universe is given as a gift.

5. The man who gifts away the universe sports in the abode of the gods along with his kinsmen as long as the moon and the sun are in the sky or the earth is steady or everyone in the abode of the heaven-dwellers is favourable. Afterwards, for rejoicing, he attains the region of Vishnu which is difficult of access even to the gods.

# 1512

# Sivapurisui

Vyasa said: O holy lord, please explain the universe, its extent, its main soul, its support and its structure so that I can have a full idea.

Sanatkumdra said:

# 6.

O sage, listen. I shall explain how high and extensive is the universe. On hearing it succinctly one gets rid of sins.

# 7.

That which is the unmanifest ultimate cause becomes manifest as Siva, free from ailment. When that becomes dichotomised, Brahma is born of that in due course.

# 8.

Brahma creates the universe consisting of the fourteen worlds. O dear, I shall succinctly explain that in proper order. Listen to it assiduously.

# 9.

The nether worlds are seven only. The upper worlds are also seven. The height of the universe is twice as such and it stands in the middle of water.

# 10.

Its support is the serpent Sesa. He is glorified as Visnu. At the instance of Brahma he supports all this.

# 11.

Even the gods and the Asuras are incompetent to describe the attributes of Sesa who is worshipped by the gods, sages and the Ganas and who is called as Ananfe by the Siddhas.

# 12.

He has a thousand hoods. By means of the thousand jewels on his hoods, he illuminates all the quarters. He has the brilliant ornament Svastika.

# 13.

He has only a single ear-ring. He has a crown and wears garlands. His eyes are rolling due to inebriation. He shines like a white fiery mountain.

# 14.

He is like a Kailasa mountain which shines white due to the flow of the Ganga. But he wears a blue cloth and is inebriated.

# 15-16.

He is worshipped by the gold-complexioned.

# 241.

The universe is comprised of fourteen worlds, seven rising above the earth and seven lying below. The seven upper regions are W-, W., and the seven lower are farw, and qRTTW.

Umdsarhhitd 1513

Nagavirgins in this aspect—viz. the tips of his hands are in contact with the ploughshare. He is bearing an excellent threshing rod. He is Rudra in the form of Sankargana. He is brilliant with the flame of the poisonous fire. At the end of the Kalpa, flames of fire come out of his mouths. After consuming the three worlds they subside.

# 18.

Holding the sphere of the earth on his back, Sesa, the lord of Bhutas stands at the root of Patala. He is worshipped for his endless attributes.

# 19.

The power of his virility cannot be adequately described even by the ambitious gods nor can his form be known.

# 20.

Who will adequately express his prowess? The series of his hoods, pink with the jewels go round the entire earth like a garland of flowers.

# 21.

With his eyes rolling due to inebriation when Sesa stretches himself, the earth quakes along with all its mountains, oceans and forests.

# 22-23.

O excellent sage, each of the nether worlds extends to ten thousand Yojanas. The seven nether worlds are Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Rasatala, Tala, Talatala and the Patala. The seven worlds are beneath the earth. So say the learned people.

# 24.

The height of each of these is twice its extent. The surfaces of all are grounds of gems. The palaces are full of gems and their terraces are made of gold.

# 25.

Danavas, Daiteyas, Serpents, and Rak$asas of the Daitya origin reside there.

# 26.

Narada who came to heaven from the nether region announced in the middle of the celestial assembly that the nether worlds are more beautiful than heaven.

# 27.

There, in all sorts of ornaments, lustrous jewels are present. They are white and delightful. What is there equal to it?

# 28.

The nether region is here and there brightened up by the daughters of Daityas and Danavas. Even to the liberated soul, the nether region is pleasing. Which liberated soul does not like it?

# 29.

There during the daytime there are no sun's



---


rays, nor the moon’s rays during the night. There is neither chillness nor bright sunlight. There is only the lustre of the jewel.

30. excellent sage, all sorts of foodstuffs and drinks are consumed there by extremely joyous persons. The time that passes by is not known there at all.

31. The cooings of the male cuckoo are there. Lotuses are there. There are lotus-ponds. There are rivers and lakes. Each of them is more excellent than the other.

32. There the ornaments are very brilliant. The unguents are sweet-smelling. O brahmin, the sound of Vinas, flutes and Mrdangas can be heard there. There are songs everywhere.

33. There the Daityas and serpents rejoice and enjoy pleasures. It is by performing penances that Danavas and Siddha beings attain the same.

# CHAPTER SIXTEEN

# (Uplift from the hell)

Sanatkum&#x26;ra said:

1. O excellent sage, above the nether regions, are the hells where the sinners are scorched. Listen to their description from me.

2. They are Raurava, Sukara, Tala, Vivasvat, Mahajvala, Taptakumbha, Lavana, Vilohita.

3. The river Vaitarani consists of putrid stuff flowing in it, Kfmina. Kfmibhojana, Asipatravana and Lalabhak$a are the terrible hells:

4. Puyavaha has usually flames of fire outside and is topsyturvy. Sandam£a, Kalasutra, Tamas, Avicirodhana

5. Svabhojana, Ru$ta, Maharaurava and Salmali— these and other bells are there; all of these are very grievous.



---

Um&#x26;$athhita
6. Men who are indulgent in sins are scorched there. Vyasa, I shall mention them in order. Listen attentively.

7. He who commits perjury except for the brahmins, gods and cows and he who utters a lie always goes to Raurava.

8-10. The following sinners viz the destroyer of the child in the womb, the stealer of gold, of cows, one who commits the breach of trust, the wine-addict, the brahmin slayer, the stealer of other’s wealth and he who associates with these—go to the hell Kumbha, O Vyasa. He who kills his preceptor, sister, mother, daughter or a cow too goes there. He who sells his chaste wife, he who is addicted to usury, he who sells tresses of hair and he who forsakes a devotee—all these are scorched in redhot iron.

11-13. He who insults preceptors, he who dismisses visitors and then dines, he who commits blasphemy, he who sells idols and he who cohabits with forbidden women—all these, O brahmin, go to Saptabala hell. A thief, a slayer of cows, a fallen man, a defiler of boundaries, the hater of gods, brahmins and Pitrs and the defiler of gems go to Krmibhakfa hell. They eat worms and other displeasing things.

14-16. The base man who eats before Pitrs, deities and gods and he who ignorantly or deceitfully misquotes sacred texts—these go to Lalabhaksa hell. The brahmin who associates with evil men and is surrounded by outcastes, the brahmin who officiates as priest in the sacrifice of undeserving persons, and eats forbidden food, and he who sells Soma juice—these fall into Rudhiraugha hell. He who spoils honey and creates disturbances in the village falls in the ruthless river Vaitaraiji.

17. Those who are arrogant in the freshness of youth, who transgress the bounds of decency, who are unclean and who maintain themselves on the earnings of unchaste women go to Krmya hell.

18. He who cuts off trees without purpose goes to Asipatravana hell. Those who hunt deer with K?uraprakas (arrows with horse-shoe-shaped heads) fall into Vahnijvala hell.

19. O brahmin, the brahmin, the Kshatriya or the



---


# 1516

Swapurfina VaiSya who swerves from the path of good conduct ultimately fall into the hell prescribed for dog-cooking cantatas.

20. Those who drop sacred rites in the middle and those who are fallen off from their duties in accordance with the stages of their life fall into the hell Sandam£a where the tortures are very terrible.

21. The students who are guilty of nocturnal emission of their semen and the fathers who do not properly educate their sons fall into the Svabhojana hell.

22. There are hundreds and thousands of these and other hells where thousands of sinners undergo tortures and are scorched.

23. These sins and others are thousands in number similarly, which the beings in the hells experience and try to wipe off.

24. Those who perpetrate misdeeds contrary to the injunctions of caste and stages of life whether physically, mentally or verbally fall into hell.

25. The beings in the hells are seen standing upside down by the gods in the heaven. These beings see the gods also similarly with heads down, beneath them.

26-27. Immovable beings—plants etc. and movable beings worms, insects, birds, beasts, righteous men, gods and liberated beings, all these are equal in number in heaven as also in hell. A sinner who is averse to the performance of expiatory rites goes to hell.

28. Svayambhuva Manu has ordained expiatory rites for great sins and small expiatory rites for small sins in the Kali age.

29. Of the many rites mentioned by way of expiation the remembrance of Siva is the greatest.

30. If a person commits a sin but repents after committing it, it is also an expiation. There also the remembrance of Siva is the greatest expiation.

31. A man remembering lord Siva in the midday or other occasions attains lord Siva. By remembering the lord in the morning, night or dusk, he gets his sins eliminated.



---


# 32.

It is only by remembering Siva, the lord of Um&#x26; that a man attains salvation, the annihilation of all pains or heaven.

# 33.

O leading brahmin, Japas, Homas, worship etc. are obstacles in the path of sins. O excellent sage, they do not occur anywhere in the three worlds.

# 34.

The attainment of the status of Indra, lord of the gods, is the fruit of the merit attained in Japa, Homa, worship etc. performed by the man whose mind is in lord Siva.

# 35.

O sage, he who devoutly remembers Siva day and night never goes to hell since his sins are eliminated without any vestige.

# 36.

O excellent brahmin, sin and merit indicate hell and heaven. One is conducive to misery and the other to pleasure and rebirth.

# 37.

That at the outset is conducive to happiness but later brings in misery. Hence ultimately everything is of the nature of misery. There is nothing in fact of an invariably pleasurable nature.

# 38.

Happiness and misery constitute only a temporary transformation of the mind. But knowledge is the greatest Brahman. Knowledge is conducive to the understanding of reality.

# 39.

The entire universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings has knowledge as its soul. O sage, there is nothing greater than the perfect knowledge of the greatest being.

# 40.

Thus the entire sphere of the hell has been explained by me. Hereafter I shall explain the sphere of the earth.

# CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

# (Description of the Jambndvtpa)

Sanatkumara said: —

1. O son of Parasara, listen succinctly to what I explain, the sphere of the earth consisting of seven Dvipas (continents).

2. The seven²⁴² continents are Jambu, Plaksa, Salmali, Ku£a, Kraufica, Saka, Puskara. These seven are surrounded by seven oceans.

3. The seven oceans are salt sea, sugarcane juice sea, wine sea, ghee sea, curd sea, milk sea and pure water sea. Jambu Dvipa is situated in the middle of all these.

4-6. In the middle of it is the golden mountain Meru, Kaleya. It extends below to sixteen Yojanas and its height is eighty-four Yojanas. Its expanse on the top is thirty-two Yojanas. This mountain is situated on the back of the earth and expands on all sides. It is sixteen thousand Yojanas at the base. It has the shape of a pericarp. The mountains Himavat, 243 Hemakuta 244 and Nisadha 245 are to its south.

7. The Varsa mountains in the north are Nila, Sveta and Srngin.²⁴⁶ The extent of these is ten thousand Yojanas. They are full of gems and have pinky lustre.

242. SP. mentions seven continents. Their identification is uncertain. Scholars hold different views: See Geography of the Pur&#x26;pas Ch. II. Each of the continents is surrounded by one of the seven seas and divided into several Varyas. For instance, Jambu comprises nine Varyas of which Bharata is the one. The continents comprise mountains variously classed as and 3TST. These give rise to innumerable streams and rivers that flow in the lands and fall into the sea.

243. This most celebrated mountain forms the northern boundary of Bh&#x26;rata, extending from the eastern to the western sea.

244. It is held to be identical with the Kail&#x26;sa, a sacred hill situated to the north of Manasarovara.

245. SP. places it to the south of the Meru, along with the Himavat and Hemak&#x26;ta.

246. Nila, Sveta and Sp&#x26;gin stand to the north of the Meru. Cp Sk. P. I. II. 37. 4a.

Their height is a thousand Yojanas and their width too is the same. Bharata is the first sub-continent. Then there is the Kimpuru$a.

In the north are the excellent sage, the extent of each of these, as in the case of Bharata, is nine thousand Yojanas.

# 11.</h8>
Ilavrta Var?a is in its middle and Meru rises up in its middle. In all the four quarters, peaks nine thousand Yojanas in height rise up.

# 12.</h8>
O excellent sage, such is Ilavrta and there are four mountains here which appear as supporting beams to Meru, which are joined to it and rise above.

# 13.</h8>
Mandara²⁴⁷ is in the east. Gandhamadana*⁴⁷ is in the south. Vipula²¹⁷ is in the western portion and SuparSva is situated in the north.

# 14.</h8>
Trees acting as the flagstaff of the mountain are Kadamba, Jambu, Pippala and Vata. Their height is eleven hundred Yojanas.

O great sage, listen to the origin of the name Jambudvipa. There are great trees shining here. I shall explain their nature to you.

# 16.</h8>
Fruits of the Jambu tree are of the size of a huge elephant. They fall on the top of the mountain and become shattered and scattered everywhere.

# 17.</h8>
The famous river Jambu*¹⁸ is made up of the juice of Jambu fruits. It flows there and is drunk by the residents of the locality.

People staying on its banks do not perspire. They do not emit bad odour and they do not want in the exercise of their sense-organs.

Falling in four directions the river Ganga flows into four streams viz. Sita,251 Alakananda,262 Cak?us,2M and Bhadra.254

# 31.

Sita flows to the east of the mountain, Alakananda flows to the south, the Cak?us flows to the west and the Bhadra flows to the north.

# 16.

Charitable gifts are offered here by meritorious sacrifices. Ascetics perform penances strenuously for the attainment of better worlds.

# 17.

O great sage, it is so because this is the land of sacred rites in the Jambudvipa. Here too Bharata is the most excellent. The others are lands of pleasure.

# 18.

O excellent sage, after a thousand births rarely does a man get birth as a human being here and that too due to hoarded merits.

276. The name of the Suktimat is preserved in that of the Sakti hills in Raigarh, Madhya Pradesh and possibly in that of the Suktel river which joins Mahinadf river Sonepur in Orissa. The name Suktimat was probably applied to the chain of hills that extends from Sakti in Raigarh M.

63. They are free from ailment. They are not unhappy. They are devoid of passion and hatred. Evil is never approved of by them. O sage, nor do they imprison or kill anyone.

64. There is neither truth or lie there. It is always night there. Men are of equal dress and features, all being gold-complexioned.

65. This Varsa, O sage, is Bhauma which is like a heaven on this earth and the life herein is pleasing to all, free from old age and sickness.

66. O great sage, in the Dhataklkhan^a and the Mahavlta in the Puskaradvlpa, the holy fig tree is the excellent abode of Brahma.

67. Brahma resides there, worshipped by gods and Asuras. Pu$kara is surrounded by the ocean of sweet water.

68. Thus the seven continents are surrounded by seven oceans each twice as large as the one within.

69. The speciality of the oceans is mentioned thus. The water is always equal in quantity. It is never reduced.

70. O excellent sage, if the water kept in a pot is heated it goes up. Similarly when the moon rises the water of the ocean rises up.

71. At the time of rising and setting of the moon waters flow and ebb. Hence in the bright and dark halves the waters vary in quantity; they increase and decrease.

282. It is identical with Japan, Manchuria and the south-eastern Siberia. The milky ocean enclosed by this Dvlpa is the Sea of Japan Ibid. 42-44.

UmfisathhiUt 1529

72. O great sage, the increase and decrease of the waters of the oceans are seen hundred and thousands of times. This has been mentioned to you. Puskaradvlpa, O brahmin,

73-74. All the people in the take as food Sugarcandy which appears there by itself for ever. Beyond that there are no living beings. The land is golden and devoid of living creatures.

75. Beyond that is the mountain Lok&#x26;loka. It is a thousand Yojanas in height and an equal number of Yojanas in extent. O great sage, therefore, along with this universe

76. the earth is fifty crores of Yojanas in extent inclusive of all the continents and mountains.

77. This world is the support in due course of all living beings. It has more attributes than all other elements have.

# CHAPTER NINETEEN

# ( Worlds and Planets)

Sanatkumara said:—

1. The extent to which the rays of the sun and the moon shine and illuminate is the size of the earth. It is called Bhuloka.

2-3. The sun’s sphere is situated a hundred thousand Yojanas from the earth. The moon is situated thousands of Yojanas from this earth and a hundred thousand Yojanas from the sun.

4. The spheres of the planets are entirely situated above the moon along with the stars about ten thousand Yojanas one above the other.

2)83. The Skt. text of the first half of this verse is defective.

# 5.

Budha (Mercury); above that is Kavya (Venus): above that is the sphere of Bhauma (Mars), Bphaspati (Jupiter) is above that and Sanaifcara (Saturn) is above that.

# 6.

The sphere of the seven sages (The Ursa Major) is situated a hundred thousand Yojanas above it. The Pole Star (Dhruva) is situated a hundred thousand Yojanas above the sages.

# 7.

The Pole star is the prop of the circle of luminary bodies. 284 The Bhuvarloka and Svarloka are above the earth but beneath the Pole star.

# 8.

A crore Yojanas above the Pole star is the Mahar-loka where the seven sons of Brahma are stationed. They live even during the time of Kalpa.

# 9.

The seven sons are—Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, Kapila, Asuri, Vocjhu and PaftcaSikha.

# 10.

Above that is stationed Sukra (Venus) at a distance of two hundred thousand Yojanas. Two hundred thousand Yojanas below it is stationed Budha (Mercury) the son of the moon.

# 11.

O sage, Bhauma (Mars) is stationed two hundred thousand Yojanas above it. Bfhaspati (Jupiter) is stationed two hundred thousand Yojanas above it.

# 12.

Two hundred thousand Yojanas above Jupiter, Saturn is stationed. These are the seven planets that stay in their respective zodiacs.

# 13.

The seven sages (Ursa Major) are stationed eleven hundred thousand Yojanas above the planet Saturn. The Dhruva star is said to be stationed fourteen hundred thousand Yojanas above the great star.

# 14.

Sixty-three hundred thousand Yojanas from Janaloka is stationed the Tapoloka where the gods called Vairajas stay. They are free from burning sensation.

# 15-16.

Eighty four thousand Yojanas from Tapoloka is stationed the Satyaloka. It is known as Brahmaloka where the pure-minded, perfectly wise Brahmacarins engaged in truthful virtue stay. Men who go there from the earth also stay there.

284. See P. 88 note.



---


# 17-18.

In the Bhuvarloka, the sages of great Siddhis stay in the form of gods. In the Svargaloka, the gods, the Adityas, the Maruts, the Vasus, the twin Aśvins, Viśvedevas, Rudras, Sadhyas, Nagas, Khagas etc. stay. Above that are the nine planets and above them are the seven sages free from sins.

# 19.

O sage, thus the seven worlds have been mentioned to you. The Patalas too are also seven. Thus the universe has been explained to you.

# 20.

As the wood-apple is both above and below the earth, so the universe is enveloped by the cauldron of the Cosmic Egg.

# 21-23.

It is surrounded by water ten times as large all round the fire, wind, ether and darkness. It is encompassed by the elements and the principle of Mahat, eight times as large. There surrounded by the Mahat and Pradhana is stationed the Purusa. The supreme soul is infinite. He is therefore called eternal since he has no limitation.

# 24-27.

This eternal is the cause of all. O sage, it is the great Prakṛti. From that infinite of unmanifest origin thousands and hundreds of thousands of cosmic eggs are born. The self-known great soul contains everything just as the wood contains latent fire, the gingelly seed the latent oil and the milk the latent ghee. From this primordial seed emerge all those beginning with Mahat and ending with Viśeṣa. Then the gods and others are born. Then are born birds, their progenies and the seeds of others.

# 28-29.

When the tree comes out of seed it does not suffer any depreciation or diminution. Just as fire appears from the solar stone coming in contact of the sun so also the creation takes place. Siva has no desire for it. As a result of the contact of Siva with Sakti, the gods and others are born naturally.

# 30.

They spring up through their own action. Siva manifests himself as Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Rudra.

# 31.

Every thing springs up from him and finally merges in him. Siva is sung as the performer of all activities.

# 32.

Vydsa said:— O sage Sanatkumara, omniscient, please clear my doubts. Are there worlds above this universe?



---


Sanatkum&#x26;ra said:

# 33.

O great sage, there are worlds above the universe. Please listen- I shall explain them clearly but briefly.

# 34.

The world Vaikunfha is beyond the world of Brahma. It is here that Visnu is stationed and it shines with great brilliance.

# 35.

Above it is the extremely wonderful world Kumara. The general Karttikeya, the brilliant son of Siva shines here.

# 36.

Beyond that shines the excessively divine world of Uma, where Sakti—Siva, the mother of the three deities shines.

# 37.

She is the Prakrti, greater than the greatest, with the attributes of Rajas, Sattva and Tamas. But the goddess Siva herself is devoid of attributes, free from aberrations.

# 38-39.

The eternal Sivaloka is above that. Here lord Siva, the great Brahman, shines. He is indestructible, excessively divine and endowed with great brilliance. He is the lord of all, greater than the three attributes. He is the progenitor of the three deities.

# 40.

There are no worlds above it. The Goloka is near it. Mother cows named SuSila are there. They are favourites of Siva.

# 41.

The protector of that world is Kr?na. He is established there at the behest of Siva by Siva himself who moves about as he pleases due to his power.

# 42.

O Vyasa, Siva’s region is wonderful and beautiful. It has no support. It shines with different objects. It cannot be specifically described.

# 43.

The presiding deity of that region is Siva. He is the crest-jewel of all the gods. He is worthy of being served by Vi?nu, Brahma and Siva. He is the unsullied great soul.

# 44.

O dear, thus the situation of the entire universe is narrated to you. What more do you wish to hear about the position of the worlds.

# CHAPTER TWENTY

# [The statement of a special Mantra]

Vyasa said:

1. O omniscient Sanatkumara, O the most excellent of the good, explain the acquisition of that by attaining which men endowed with devotion to Siva do not return again.

Sanatkumara said:

2. O Vyasa, son of Paratara, listen with pleasure to the auspicious salvation and the holy rite of pious devotees and the sacred rite of ascetics.

3. Those who perform holy rites, who are endowed with very pious penance and who always worship Siva should be honoured in every way always.

4. Those who have not performed austerities do not go to Siva’s region which is free from ailments. O great sage, penance alone leads to Siva’s blessings.

5. The gods and Ganas rejoice in heaven due to penance. So also the sages and the ascetics. Know my statement to be true.

6. Everything can be achieved through penance, whether it is difficult to be sustained, or propitiated or is burdensome or difficult to be transgressed. Penance cannot be transgressed.

7. Brahma stays steady in his penance. So also Vishnu and Siva. All the gods and the goddesses have attained rare benefits through penance.

8. There is no doubt that in this world the particular goal is realised through penance by those who aspire for it.

9. O Vyasa, penance is the means for achieving everything. It is of three kinds viz. Sattvika, Rajasa and Tamasa.

10. The Sattvika penance is performed by the gods and the ascetics of sublimated prowess; the Rajasa penance is by the Danavas and human beings.

11-12. Their result too is threefold, achievable by the



---


1534 Steapurifya sages who have truthful vision. The Sattvika penance consists of Japa, meditation and auspicious worship of the deities with devotion. It is the means of achieving all benefits and all desires here and hereafter.

13. The Rajasa penance is performed with a specific desire as the fruit. Here the body is subjected to tortures and unbearable whithering and macerating processes.

14. That is Tamasa penance which has a passionate end in view.

15-21. The Sattvika penance is the most excellent. It makes righteous intellect firm and steady. It has following characteristics — performance of ceremonial ablution, worship, Japa, sacrifice, scrupulous purity and cleanliness, non-violence, sacred rites, observance of fasts, silence, control of the sense-organs, pure intelligence, learning, truthfulness, refraining from anger, charitable gifts, forgiveness, suppression of the sense-organs, mercifulness, digging of wells, tanks and lakes, building of mansions for public cause observing Kfcchra, Candrayana and other rites, Yajftas, pilgrimages, hermitages, holy places and other acts pleasing to sensible persons. O Vyasa, good virtue is the cause of Siva’s devotion. Celebration of the day of sun’s transit, the conjunction of equinoxes the Nadamukta, Dhyana or meditation shall be in all the three occasions. It is the retention of the mind in the brilliance. Pranayama is three-fold viz. Recaka, Puraka and Kumbhaka. This along with the knowledge of the course of the veins, withdrawal or obstruction of senses are the means of perfect knowledge and the achievement of the eight siddhis, Anima, etc.

22. In the state of trance there are various stages such as the stage of the log of wood, the stage of the dead and the stage of Harita. All these are destructive of all sins.

23. These five are the prosperities of royal glory- women, bed, drink, good garments unguents and incense, and the chewing of betel leaves.

24-25. The forms of various pleasures are blocks gold, copper, houses, gems, cows, scholarship in the Vedas and Sastras, ornaments, ability to sing and dance, conches, Villas, Mfdangas, lordly elephants, umbrellas and chowries. Man yearning for these takes delight in these.



---


# 26.

O sage, but he does not know that these are only reflections in a mirror, not real substances. Just as the gingelly seeds are crushed to yield oil he gets himself crushed to yield things of pleasure. He madly rushes after them deluded by false knowledge. Some one seems to tell him, “Go on quickly.”

# 27.

In spite of realising this he moves up and down in the world like the water-raising wheel. He takes various births in the mobile and immobile forms of life. He is distressed throughout.

# 28.

After the transmigration through various forms of life ultimately he attains the rare human birth.

# 29.

Human birth is attained even out of turn if the merit is weighty enough. As a result of the weightiness or otherwise of the actions, the goals achieved are of diverse nature.

# 30.

If anyone does not strive for salvation even after obtaining human birth which is capable of achieving heaven and salvation, surely he bemoans his lot for a long time, when dead.

# 31.

Even to the god and the Asuras the birth as human being is very rare to be achieved. After attaining the same he should do such things as would prevent his fall in the hell.

# 32.

If there is no endeavour for the acquisition of heaven and salvation even after attaining the rare human form that birth is to be dubbed as useless.

# 33.

Human birth is glorified as the root-cause for the four aims of life. O Vyasa, after getting it, one shall assiduously and virtuously maintain it.

# 34.

Human birth has virtue as its root. It shall achieve all objects. Even if there is no endeavour to achieve any special aim after getting human birth at least one should preserve the root.

# 35.

Who can be a more senseless man than one who does not strive for the welfare of the soul after attaining the rare birth as a brahmin in the course of human birth?

# 36.

Of all the continents, this continent is called the land of sacred rites. It is from here that heaven and salvation are attained.



---

Sitapur&#x26;Qa
37. Indeed the soul is deceived by that man who does not strive for welfare despite attaining human form in this land of Bharata Varga.

38. O brahmin, this is the land of sacred rites and that is the land of enjoyment. The fruit of the sacred rite performed is enjoyed in heaven.

39. One should continue to perform virtuous rites as long as the health and normalcy of the body is maintained. A sick man is not eager to perform anything even when urged by others.

40. If anyone does not try to achieve the permanent through the non-permanent body, the permanent is lost for him and the non-permanent has already perished.

41. Under the pretext of passing days and nights pieces of life fall off. Why is it not realised?

42. When it is not known who will die and when, when the death is so sudden and unexpected who can have self-confidence?

43. It is certain that one will ultimately go away leaving off everything. Why then does he not give off in charity, all the wealth, so that it can be the packet of fooding on his way to Yama’s abode?

44. A man who has taken the packet of fooding with him by virtue of giving charitable gifts, goes to Yama’s abode without difficulty. Otherwise the creature suffers on the way without the packet of food.

45. O Kaleya, they gain at every step whose merits are full and perfect and who go to heaven.

46. Realising this, man should perform meritorious rites and avoid sinful activities. Thanks to the merit one attains godhood. A person devoid of merit goes to hell.

47. They who take refuge in Siva, lord of the gods, even slightly, do not see the terrible Yama nor the terrible hell.

48. But at the behest of Siva, due to sins and great delusions, those men stay there for sometime and then go to the region of Siva.

285. The verse with slight variations occurs in Pane. Mitraprftpti (Verse 141).



---


UmSsaihtitt 1537

49. But those who have taken refuge in lord Siva wholly are not smeared with sin like the leaf of the lotus with water.

50. O excellent sage, they who repeat the names of Siva need not be afraid of hell or Yama.

51. The two syllables “Siva” constitute the packet of fooding for the journey to the other world; it is the means of salvation, free from worries and is the abode of all merits.

52. It is only the name of Siva that subdues and quells the great ailment of worldly existence. Nothing else does the same, as I see.

53. Formerly Pulka£a committed thousands of murders of Brahmins but on hearing the sacred name Siva, he attained salvation.

54. Hence a sensible man shall enhance his devotion to Siva incessantly. O intelligent one, one attains worldly pleasures and salvation due to the devotion to Siva.

# CHAPTER TWENTYONE

# (The fruits of righteous war)

Vydsa said:

1-2* Brahminhood is difficult to be achieved. Brahmin is born of the face of Siva; K$atra, of the arms; VaiSya of the thighs and Sudra of the feet of the lord—so says the Veda. But do people attain salvation from the lower position? Please tell me.

Sanatkumdra said:

3. O Kaleya, men fall off their status due to evil deeds. Hence, after attaining the high status, the learned man shall preserve it.

4. He who forsakes brahmizihood and is born as a Kgatriya falls off the status of a brahmin and assumes the status of a Kjatriya.

5. Cp. Rv. X. 9®* ^



---


5. Due to his resorting to evil, the foolish fellow goes on changing thus. He takes thousands of births and plunges himself into gloom.

6. Hence after attaining the highest status one should not err or destroy it. Even in the face of adversity one shall always preserve his status.

7. After attaining the auspicious brahminhood if a person disrespects brahminhood and does not differentiate between what could be eaten and what could not be eaten he becomes a Ksatriya.

8. I shall explain to you entirely that which gives a higher caste whereby an intelligent Sudra becomes a Vaisya.

9. Being born a Sudra, one shall take up the duties of Sudra as ordained, viz, the due service to the people of the other three castes.

10-15. By doing this regularly and aspiring for Vaisya-hood, even a Sudra attains it. A Vaisya who uses his wealth for sacred rites, who performs sacrifices duly, who performs the Agnihotra and partakes of the remnants of food therefrom, is reborn in a Ksatriya family. There is no doubt in this. He is born as a Ksatriya by means of consecrated sacrifices with proper gifts. A Ksatriya shall do like this. He shall study the Vedas desirous of heaven. He shall maintain the three sacrificial fires. He shall wash his hands and feet before entering shrines. He shall protect the earth virtuously. He shall cohabit with his wife during the prescribed period after the monthly menses. He shall remain devout and pious. He shall be hospitable to all. He shall fight and get killed in battle for acquiring facilities to achieve the three aims of life (virtue, wealth and love) to all living beings or for the sake of cows and brahmins. Thus when his soul is purified by fires and mantras he becomes a brahmin. After becoming a brahmin, if he follows the rules he becomes a priest in a sacrifice.

16. Strictly observing his rites, speaking truth and controlling the sense-organs he derives vast pleasures of heaven. He becomes a favourite of the gods.

17-18. O great sage, brahminhood is very difficult to achieve. It is attained by men who undergo hardships.



---


Umdsarfihitd 1539

Salvation is achieved after attaining brahminhood entirely. Hence a brahmin shall be virtuous. With great effort he shall preserve his excellent brahminhood which is a good means of achieving all the aims of life.

Vy&#x26;sa said:

# 19.

O excellent sage, you have mentioned about the glory. O foremost among the eloquent, I wish to hear this. Please mention.

Sanatkumdra said:

# 20-21.

Those who know the principles, who understand sacrifices and sacred rites say thus — “By performing the Agni stoma and other sacrifices with profuse gifts one does not attain that benefit which is attained through battle.” Hence I shall explain to you the fruit attained by those who maintain themselves by means of weapons.

# 22-24.

The hero who offers battle subduing the army of the enemy attains virtue, wealth and fame. He achieves the fruit of a sacrifice with due gifts and the three aims of life, virtue, wealth and love. He who faces the enemy, kills him and gets on to the enemy’s chariot goes to Vignuloka. He who is not defeated in war, nor killed in it attains the fruit of four horse-sacrifices.

# 25.

He who dies in the war-front without surrendering his weapons attains heaven from which there is no return.

# 26.

The king, or prince or the general who heroically fights and is killed by Ksatriya attains everlasting regions.

# 27.

He attains as many worlds as the number of his hairs split by arrows in the battle. All of these will be wish-yielding and eternal.

# 28.

O Vyasa, both here and hereafter he will have heroic seat, heroic bed, heroic status and heroic stability always.

# 29.

Those who die for the protection of cows, brahmins, status and the master go happily to the other world like virtuous persons.

987. Cp Panca. Mitrabh'da 208, 424.



---

Even a slayer of a brahmin fighting for his master in a battle and dying there attains heaven which becomes his permanent abode.

The goal realised by the person who dies for the brahmins, cows and his master, being killed by carnivorous beasts or tusked beasts is excellent. It yields him extensive and never-ending benefits.

A man may be competent to perform hundreds of sacrifices, but it is very difficult to renounce his own body in a righteous war.

A righteous war is conducive to the attainment of heaven. It is sanctifying. It makes known the multi-faced beauty of a man. This is the case with the people of all castes, particularly so in the case of a K$atriya.

Now I shall explain clearly the eternal virtue concerning war, as to who can be attacked and hit and who shall be spared.

Even if a brahmin well-versed in Vedanta doctrine were to attack one violently with lethal weapons one can fight him in return. He will not become guilty of brahminicide thereby.

Even a murderer shall not be attacked and killed if he is thirsty and begs for water. O Vyasa, by killing the sick and the distressed even in battle a man becomes guilty of brahminicide.

One becomes a murderer of a brahmin by killing the sick, the feeble, the child, the hen-pecked, the miserly and one whose bow or bowstring is broken.

After considering all this, an intelligent man shall strenuously indulge in battles. He will achieve the purpose of his life and rejoice here and hereafter.

According to the laws of the caste as laid down in the Dharma&#x26;stras, the profession of fighting is assigned exclusively to the people of K^atriya caste. But $P. probably following the contemporary practice allows it for all the castes.

Cp. Manu viii, 350, 351.

# CHAPTER TWENTYTWO

# ( The origin and development of the body)

Vyasa said:

1. O dear, O great sage, for realizing the worldly detachment please mention the detailed mode of the birth of living beings and their stay in the womb.

Sanatkumara said:

2. O Vyasa, listen succinctly to the essence of the sacred lore. I shall explain the excellent mode of worldly detachment which removes the bondage with the world, of a man desirous of liberation.

3-4. When we cook rice the process is as follows. In the cooking vessel the rice and water remain separate. Water is above fire. The rice is above water. The wind slowly blows against the fire beneath the water. The fire kindled by the wind makes the water boil.

5. The rice with hot-boiling water all round it becomes cooked. When cooked it becomes separated into sediment and juice.

6. (More or less a similar process takes place in the body.) The sediment in the body consists of twelve forms of waste matter. These are split and sent out of the body. The juice matter circulates in the body. Man gets nourished through it.

7. The ears, the eyes, the nose, the tongue, the teeth, the penis, the anus, and the nails are the receptacles of dirt secreted by them. The phlegm, the sweat, the faeces and the urine— these together make up the twelve.

8. All the vessels scattered all over the body are joined centrally at the heart. These vessels shall be understood to convey Rasa. O sage, I shall mention their process of working.

9. Prana (the vital air) places the subtle lymph at the mouths of the vessels. Then it fills the entire vessels with the lymph.

10-11. Thus filled, the vessels circulate all over the



---

1542 Awapurdtta

Then the lymph inside the vessels gets cooked by the fire in the body. There are two modes of cooking. [Probably the separation of sediment and watery part]. The skin is covered thereby. [The cells constituting the skin are generated]. Blood is produced.

# 12.

The hair of the body and flesh are produced from the blood. The hair on the head and the sinews are produced from the flesh. From the sinews the bones are produced. The nails and marrow are produced from the bones.

# 13.

An alternative cause of marrow, the semen itself becomes progeny. Thus the twelvefold metabolism of blood is explained.

# 14-16.

The semen is secreted from the food eaten. From the semen, the birth of another body is made possible. When the semen unalloyed is deposited in the vaginal passage during the prescribed period of cohabitation after the monthly menses, then the semen blown by the vital wind mingles with the blood of the woman. At the time when the semen is discharged the individual soul with the causal body or unit of sense-organs etc. enters the vaginal passage fully covered and urged by its past actions. The semen and blood in the unified state become foetus in a day.

# 17.

In five nights the foetus assumes the shape of bubbles and the bubbly mass becomes muscular mass in seven nights.

# 18-19.

Within two months the following parts of the body are formulated in order Viz. the neck, the head, the shoulders, the backbone, the belly, hands and feet, the sides, the lips etc. Within three months all the joints are completed.

# 20.

Within the fourth month the fingers are duly formed. The mouth, nose, and ears are ready within the fifth month.

# 21.

Within six months the row of teeth, the private parts and the nails and the orifice of the ears take shape.

# 22.

The rectum, or the penis of the vaginal passage and the navel too are formulated. Within the seventh all the limb-joints are completed.

---

UmtsaMdU

# 23.

O excellent sage, thus the complete child with all the limbs stays in the womb covered by the embryonic skin.

# 24.

The child increases and develops day by day, stealthily taking in the food of the mother, of all the six tastes, through the umbilical cord.

# 25.

Then the soul complete in this body recollects all the pleasures and sorrows and everything done by it formerly as if in a dream.

# 26.

“I am dead and born many times. In these different births I have seen many types of wombs.

# 27.

This time when I am born and consecrated I shall strive for welfare by means of this body so that I may not have to stay in another womb in future.

# 28.

So thinks the child in the womb: “As soon as I am released from this womb I shall seek Siva’s perfect knowledge that repels all worldly existence.”

# 29.

Troubled and tormented by the distress in the result of his past actions, the individual soul stays there pondering over the means of liberation.

# 30.

Just as a traveller surrounded by huge impassable mountains on all sides stands helplessly in his distress, so also the creature in the womb enveloped by the embryonic skin stays miserably.

# 31.

Just as a man drowning in the sea is very much distressed, so also the child in the womb completely drenched by the liquid secretion in the womb is always distressed excessively.

# 32.

Just as a person is cooked and boiled in an iron cauldron by means of fire, so also the child hurled into the pot of womb is cooked by the gastric fire.

# 33.

For him staying inside the womb, the misery is equal to, nay, more than the misery of a person incessantly pierced by means of red-hot needles.

# 34.

There is nowhere a greater misery than staying within the womb. To all embodied souls it is full of misery, very terrible and grievous.

# 35.

This type of misery is for the sinners. But those of virtuous intellect take birth within seven months.



---


# 36.

Getting crushed in the vaginal passage as if within a machine is a misery more grievous than the stay within the womb. O Vyasa, this takes place in regard to the sinners and not the virtuous.

# 37.

Just as the sugarcane is crushed in the machine, the sinner is crushed and beaten on the head by the iron club of sin.

# 38.

Just as the gingelly seeds pressed in the oil machine become a worthless residue, so also the body becomes a waste being crushed by the muscular walls of the vaginal passage.

# 39-43.

This body in the womb is in an unenviable position. The hands and legs are like suspended pillars. Sinews tie them up in various ways. The whole body is smeared with dirty blood and flesh. It is the receptacle of faeces and urine. It is covered with hairs and nails. It is sickly and an abode of ailments. The only great opening is the mouth. It has eight small apertures like windows. The two lips are like two doors. The tongue is the bolt for them. The body is sick due to its thirst for pleasures. It is subservient to passion and hatred and utterly deluded. The various limbs overlap one another. It is surrounded by the embryonic membrane. With very great pain and difficulty it has to come out of the vaginal passage. It is drenched with urine, blood and faeces. It comes out as from a sheath. It is a mass of skeleton.

# 44.

The bones are three hundred and sixty in number. There are five hundred muscles. The body is covered with thirty-five million hairs.

# 45.

The hairs are subtle and gross, visible and invisible. The veins and vessels within the body too are so many in number.

# 46.

The internal secretions circulate within and go out through these vessels. The teeth are thirty-two in number and the nails are twenty.

# 47.

The measure of bile content in the body is one Kutfava. (1/4 of Prastha or 12 handfuls). The phlegm is one Atfhaka (256 fistfuls). The vasa fat weighs 20 palas. Half of that is the tawny matter.



---


IMS

48. The weight of solid fat is 2$ Tulas and ten palas. Blood is three palas and it is four times the marrow.

49. The semen is half a Kucjava. The strength of the living beings depends on it. A mass of flesh weighs a thousand palas.

50. O excellent sage, the blood is hundred palas according to which the faeces and the urine form four handfuls each.

51. Such is the transient abode, the body of the eternal soul. It is impure while the soul is pure. It is generated due to his past actions and their bondage.

# CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE

# (The description of infancy and other stages and the impurity of the body)

Sanatkumdra said: O

1. O Vyasa, highly intelligent sage, listen to the impurity of the body and the greatness of good feelings. I shall explain briefly.

2. The body is considered impure because it is produced by the mingling of semen and blood and is always full of faeces and urine.

3. Just as a pot, full of faeces cannot become pure even when washed outside, so also the body washed outside cannot become pure. Hence it is impure.

4. Even after taking in the sanctifying Paficagavya, Havis (Ghee oblation) etc. the body becomes impure the next moment. What else is more impure than this body?

5. Even after taking in sweet, fragrant and delicious foodstuffs and drinks the body becomes impure quickly. What else is more impure than this.

6. O men, don’t you see dirty and foetal matter coming out of your bodies day by day. How can the receptacle of such matter be pure?

# Shapur

7 Even if the body is sprinkled with the waters of the holy Ku£a grass and smeared with Paficagavya,*10 it will not become free from dirt like charcoal even when it is rubbed and polished.

8. Like the perennial flow of the springs of a mountain the vessels of the body discharge phlegm, urine, faeces and other types of filth. How can that body become clean?

9. There is not even a single clean spot on the body the receptacle of all types of filth and a leather bag of faeces and urine.

10. After touching the tips of the vessels of one’s own body the hand is washed with sand and water. Still the persons who are slaves to this filthy body do not feel.

11. Inspite of being smeared and sanctified assiduously by sweet scents, incense and other things the body does not eschew its nature like the curved tail of a dog.

12. Just as an object, naturally black, cannot become white by any means, so also the physical body does not become clean though it is scrubbed and cleaned.

13. Though he smells his own noxious odour, though he sees his own dirt, no man becomes detached and keeps his hand on his nose.

14. Wonderful indeed is this great delusion whereby the whole universe is enveloped. He does not observe the impurities of his body and become disgusted with it.

15. If a man is not detached from the world due to the foetal smell of his own what other cause of detachment can be imparted to him?

16. In the midst of the entire universe, the body alone is the most unclean. By touching its filthy limbs even the pure becomes impure.

17. The purification of the body is for removing bad odour and sliminess. If both are removed there is purity. The touch of a pure thing also sanctifies it.

18. But let him be cleaned with all the waters of the Ganga, with heaps of sand resembling a mountain or let him observe purificatory rites till death, if a man has wicked feelings and emotions he can never be purified.

It consists of the five products of the cow: viz. milk, curd, butter and the liquid mad solid excreta.



---

Umdsarhkitd
# 19.

A vicious soul is not sanctified by the waters in the pilgrim spots nor by austerities. Does the canine hide become pure when washed in a holy river?

# 20.

Neither heaven nor salvation can be attained by a man of vicious emotion even if he immolates himself in the holy fire. The only result will be that his body is entirely burnt off.

# 21.

We assert that a man of vicious instinct and feeling never becomes pure though he may indulge in ablutions throughout his life with all the waters of the Ganga and a mountain of sand.

# 22.

If a man of defiled emotion gets himself burnt after entering a huge blazing fire kindled by sprinkling ghee and oil and with flames of circular motion he does not become pure.

# 23.

Fishes stay in the holy Ganga and other sacred rivers. Flocks of birds stay in the temple. They do not attain any special benefit from the ceremonial ablutions and charitable gifts since they are devoid of holy feelings.

# 24.

It is the purity of the feelings that is the criterion for the sanctity of rites. The wife is embraced with one feeling and the daughter is embraced with another.

# 25.

Feelings are different in the mind even if the objects are not different. The same woman is looked at in one way by the son and in another way by the husband.

# 26.

O observe the great fortune in the difference of emotions. The man, though embraced, does not love the woman who is devoid of the feelings of love.

# 27.

If the three emotions, passion etc. were to create worries in the mind no one would relish different delicious or fragrant stuffs.

# 28.

Man is caught hold of by emotions and man can rid himself of emotions. A man purified by pure emotions attains heaven and salvation.

# 29.

Performing Japas, sacrifices and eulogies after purifying the soul with pure emotions a man acquires perfect knowledge and after death he attains the worlds of persons who perform many sacrifices.



---

30. The purification and removal of the sliminess and bad odour of the faeces and urine of ignorance and passion of men is effected by the pure water of knowledge and the clay of detachment from the world.

31. Thus as the body is naturally unclean it is worthless. Like the inner stump of the plantain tree it has only the outer skin as substantial.

32-33. An intelligent man shall understand that the body is defective and faulty. He shall be disinterested in such emotions as revolve round the pleasures of the body. With the mind in restraint and intellect delighted he surmounts the worldly existence and becomes a living liberated soul. He who firmly grasps the inner stump of the plantain tree of worldly existence is not liberated.

34. Thus the misery of life is proclaimed to be grievous and painful to men due to the fault of ignorance and the influence of different activities.

35. I shall explain in half a stanza what is mentioned in crores of books. The feeling of “My-ness” is the greatest affliction. The feeling of “not-my-ness” is the greatest joy.

36. Hundreds and thousands of monarchs who had been in bondage had attained the greatest world on reaching the Nirmamatva (not-my-ness) state.

37. What little recollection the child had while within the womb perishes when his misery develops further on being crushed by the muscular walls of the vaginal passage as if within a machine.

38. A great fever overtakes him as soon as the external air touches him or delusion overwhelms him.

39. Due to that fever a great fascination overpowers him and deludes him. After being deluded he soon suffers from the loss of memory.

40. Loss of memory leads to forgetfulness of all previous activities. The creature soon begins to love the present birth.

41. The passionate and deluded world does not engage in activities beneficial to itself. It does not realise itself nor others nor even the deity.

42. O good sage, though he has ears man does not...

# UmdjarhhiM

listen to what is beneficial to him. Even when he has competent eyes he does not see what is good.

43. Walking slowly on the level, even path he falters at every step. Even when he has intellect, even when he is enlightened by scholars he does not understand.

44. Thereby, urged and prompted by great greed he suffers pain and distress in the world. His intellect no longer remembers the sins he committed which he remembered in the womb.

45. This great divine Sastra has been narrated by Siva in the context of penance as a means to achieving heaven and salvation.

46. Even when the perfect knowledge of Siva that leads to the achievement of desire is available, it is really a great surprise if people do not strive for its attainment in their own interest.

47. There is again this great misery in infancy because the operative power of the sense-organs is not clearly manifest or developed. Even if he wishes he is unable to express or take remedial or preventive measures.

48. There is a great trouble when the child cuts the teeth. There is pain due to minor childhood ailments, different kinds of children’s diseases and adverse evil planets and other evils.

49. The infant boy may remain somewhere very hungry and thirsty, or lying somewhere he may be crying or he may be eating or drinking faeces and the urine due to delusion.

50-51. During childhood when the rite of earboring is performed or when the parents beat him or when he feels difficulty in learning the alphabet it is surprising that the stupid fellow does not strive for his welfare, even after seeing and somehow surmounting the miseries of boyhood.

52. Where is happiness during youth, when all the sense-organs are developed fully and begin to function, and there is an attack from the sickness of lust that remains unrealised ever?

53. Then he feels misery from malice and rivalry.



---


By delusion his eyes become red like those of an infuriated man. Its abandonment is only conducive to misery.

54. During nights he does not get proper sleep because he is scorched by the fire of lust. Where is pleasure even during the day because he is worried over the ways and means of earning wealth?

55. The drops of semen of a man whose mind is dwelling on women do not bring him pleasure. They are like his own sweat drops, mere dirt.

56. What happens in women is exactly what happens to a leprous monkey when it scratches itself on being afflicted by worms.

57. The pleasure in women is similar to the pleasure that is felt when the pus comes out of a swollen tumour. It is nothing more than that.

58. The pleasure in women is similar to the pleasure one feels when faeces and urine are discharged. But it has been considered otherwise by the stupid.

59. It has been mentioned by Paftcacucja that there is not even a particle of pleasure in women who are the storehouses of all blemishes and who are creatures unsubstantial.

60. Due to honour and disrespect, due to union with and separation from the beloved people youth is soon devoured by old age. Where is pleasure without torment?

61-62. The youth of women and men which had been mutually pleasurable formerly is not so now when it is overwhelmed by old age, when the body is rendered shattered and rickety by wrinkles, grey hairs and baldness and when the man is incompetent to perform any serious task.

63. Who can be a more senseless person than the man who feels attracted to worldly pleasures even after seeing himself completely transformed due to old age as if he were a new person not existing before?

64. A man overwhelmed by old age is tormented by daughters, sons and other kinsmen and even by servants who cannot be kept under control because they are not attached to him.

65. An aged man incompetent to strive for virtue, wealth, love and salvation. Hence a young man shall strive for these virtues.

# CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR

# (Women's nature)

Vydsa said:

1. O sage, if you are pleased with me you shall narrate succinctly what was mentioned by Paftcacucja viz., that women are despicable.

Sanatkumdra said:

I shall explain the nature of women as it is. O dear, listen to it, merely by hearing which excellent detachment results.
O sage, women are light-minded. They are at the root of all troubles. Attachment towards them should not be pursued by wakeful persons who desire liberation.
In this respect they quote an ancient tradition, the conversation of N&#x26;rada with the unchaste woman Paficacuda.
Formerly, while the intelligent celestial sage N&#x26;rada was wandering in the worlds he saw the beautiful celestial damsel Paficactuja. The sage Narada asked the beautiful Apsaras:
“O lady of beautiful waist, I have a certain doubt. Please explain it to me.”
O brahmin, thus addressed the excellent celestial damsel replied: “If you consider me competent and if there is a proper subject, I shall explain.”

Ndrada said:

O gentle lady, I shall never engage you in a subject beyond your scope. O lady of slender waist, I wish to hear from you the nature of women.

Sanatkumdra said:

On hearing these words of that celestial sage the excellent Apsaras replied to that lord of sages, Narada the excellent sage.

PaficacQda said:

# 10.

“O sage listen, being a woman I cannot censure women. You already know what women are and what their nature is. O celestial sage, does not behove you to urge me in such a question.” After saying this the excellent Apsaras Paficacu^a kept quiet.

# 11.

On hearing her excellent statement the most excellent of the celestial sages replied to her with a desire for the benefit of the worlds.

# 12.

JV&#x26;rada said:

# 13.

It may be wrong to make a false statement. There is no defect in speaking the truth. Know this, O lady of good waist and speak the truth.

# 14.

Sanatkumdra said:

# 15.

Thus prompted, the sweet-smiling lady, resolved and immediately began to explain truthfully the permanent defects of women.

# 16.

Paficacuda said:

# 17.

O Narada, this is the defect in women. Even women of noble families, women with husbands and women endowed with beauty do not stand within the limits of decency.

# 18.

There is none more sinning and more sinful than women. Women are at the root of all sins. This you know already.

# 19.

They might have husbands of good knowledge, of ample wealth, of great comeliness and pleasing to them. But when they get opportunities for erring, they do not wait.

# 20.

O holy lord, this is the evil practice of all of us, women, that we resort to sinful men casting off all shame and shyness.

# 21.

Women love only those persons who solicit their company, who approach them intimately and who render them a little bit of service.

291. Pa flea. Mitrabheda 142.



---


# 20.

Women usually do not observe the limitations of conventional decency. If at all they stand by them with their husbands it is because no man makes advances to them or because they are afraid of their husbands. 29*

# 21.

There is no man not worthy of honour to women. They are not mindful of the age of the man. They carry on their dalliances with any man ugly or beautiful. 293

# 22.

It is not due to fear, taunts or affection for their husbands or regard for their lineage that women remain loyal to their husbands.

# 23.

Even women of noble families aspire for the life of lascivious women who in their prime of youth adorned with lovable ornaments and beautiful wearing garments move about frivolously.

# 24.

Even the women who are honoured well, loved intimately and looked after with care become attached to hunchbacks, blind men, imbeciles and dwarfs.

# 25.

O celestial sage, they become attached to lame and even despicable persons. O great sage, there is none in the world who cannot be approached by women with solicitations of lust.

# 26.

O brahmin, if women do not get men for their dalliance they begin to indulge in abnormal sexual activity with one another. They do not stand by their husbands.

# 27.

Women become desperate when they do not get men, when they are afraid of servants, when they are frightened of being killed or imprisoned.

# 28.

Because they indulge in sexual intercourse as they please they are fickleminded, of evil deeds and emotionally incomprehensible even to an intelligent man.

# 29.

Fire is not satiated with the logs of wood it consumes; the ocean is not satiated with the rivers that flow into it. The god of death is not satiated with the living beings he kills and women are not satiated with the number of men they cohabit with. 294

# 30.

O excellent sage, there is another secret of all women that immediately on seeing a man their vaginal passage begins to exude slimy secretions.

# 31.

On seeing a man fresh and clean from his bath with his body perfumed with sweet scents, the vaginal passage of women begins to exude like water dripping from a leather bag.

# 32.

Women do not brook their husbands who may give all that they love, who may honour and console them and who may look after them well.

# 33.

Women do not remain satisfied and contented so much with simple loves and pleasures and with ornaments and money as with illicit love pursued by them with other men.

# 34.

Women can be kept equally balanced against all these put together viz., god of death, Yama, Antaka, Patala, the submarine fire, the sharp edge of razor, poison, serpent and fire.

# 35.

Ever since the five elements, O the world, the men and women were created by Brahma, Narada, the defect lies in women always.

# Sanatkumara said:

# 36.

On hearing her words Narada was satisfied in his mind. Considering it to be the truth he became disinterested in them.

# 37.

O Vyasa, thus the nature of women as mentioned by Paficacu<ja has="" been="" narrated="" to="" you.="" what="" other="" cause="" of="" detachment="" do="" you="" wish="" hear?&#x3C;="" p="">

# CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE

Vydsa said: — (Ascertainment of the time of death)

1. O omniscient Sanatkumara, O sage, the nature of women has been heard by me from you. Please narrate the knowledge of Kala with pleasure.

Sanatkumdra said:

2. Formerly, this very same thing Parvati asked lord Siva after hearing various divine stories and delightedly bowing to him.

Parvati said:

3. O lord, thanks to your grace, everything has been understood by me and pondered over, such as your due worship, O lord, and the mantra befitting the same.

4. But still, O lord, a doubt regarding the wheel of time lingers in my mind. What are the signs of death? What is the extent of life?

5. O lord, please tell me everything if I am your beloved. On being asked thus by the goddess, lord Siva replied.

Lord Siva said:

6. O beloved, I shall tell you the truth, the Sastra that is the most excellent of all, by which, O goddess, men can understand their time of death.

7. The day, the fortnight, the month, the season, the transit of the sun and the year can be known by meai;^; of the subtle or gross, external or internal signs.

8. O Uma, O beautiful lady, I shall tell that to you factually now, for the welfare of the people and for hanging about their detachment from the world.

9. G I,. sieved, if the ted” ! of a :*jdden pale and white w vh red patches all rc.nd and above, know that death will take place within six months.

10. When there partly**? *r. *he face, ears, eye* or

# 1556

in the tongue, O beloved, know that death will take place within six months.

11. O gentle lady, if a man does not hear the sound accompanying a shrill cry, immediately, death within six months shall be declared by those who understand Kala.

12. When in contact with the light of the sun, moon or fire if a man does not see the brilliant lustre, if he sees everything black he will remain alive only for six months more.

13. O beloved, O goddess, if the left hand throbs for seven days, there is no doubt that he will live only for a month more.

14. If the limbs unfold and expand, if the palate dries up, there is no doubt that he will live only for a month more.

15. When the three humours are disturbed and the nose begins to water, his life is only for a fortnight more. The mouth and the throat of a man sure to die at the end of six months, become parched.

16. O beautiful lady, if the tongue becomes thick and the teeth begin to exude, death takes place within six months. The same may be inferred through these signs.

17-18. If a man does not see himself reflected in water, oil, ghee or in the mirror or if he sees with distorted flesh or features he will live only for six months more. This shall be declared by the expert. O goddess, now listen to other signs whereby death can be inferred.

19. If a man sees his shadow without the head or if he does not see the shadow at all he will not live for one full month thereafter.

20. O Parvati, the signs of death evinced by bodily limbs have been explained. gentle lady, I shall now mention the extraneous signs. Listen.

21. O goddess, if the zone of the sun or the moon appears devoid of rays or like the trumpet flower, the man dies within half a month.

22. If a person does not see the star Arundhati or the



---

Umisarhkitd
moon with the black spot, or if any one does not see any star he lives only for a month.29

# 23.

If a person does not see the star Utathya or the Polar star or the solar zone or has delusion of quarters on seeing the planet he dies within six months.

# 24.

If a man sees rainbow at night or the fall of the meteor at midday or if he is surrounded by vultures and crows he lives only for six months more.

# 25.

If the great Bear and the Milky way are not seen in the sky, know him to live for only six months more. This shall be declared by the experts.

# 26.

If any person sees the sun or the moon suddenly seized by Rahu, or the wheel of quarters whirling, he dies within six months definitely.

# 27.

If a person is suddenly surrounded by blue bees, he will live only a month more. That is true.

# 28.

Surely the person dies soon within a month if a crow or a dove attacks him and settles on his head.

# 29.

Thus the evil portents of an external nature have been explained to you. For the benefit of human beings I shall mention succinctly.

# 30.

O goddess, one can see Kala within his two hands, the left and the right. It has been directly narrated.

# 31.

O beautiful goddess, in brief there are two fortnights. In these one shall take bath and be clear, remember the lord with controlled senses.

# 32.

He shall wash his hands with red lac juice and milk. He shall hold scents and fragrant flowers in the hands and try to forestall his good or bad luck.

# 33-34.

O beloved, beginning with the little finger and ending with the thumb, one should make the Nyasa (mystical placing) of each of the Tithis on each knot. Thus the two hands together will cover the mouth. Keep the hands in the cuplike form and sit facing the east.

# 35.

The devotee then should repeat the Navatmaka mantra one hundred and eight times. Then he shall scrutinise every one of the knots in the fingers of both the hands.

295. The Skt. text of the first pStla of this verse is defective.



---


# 36.

O beloved, if the devotee sees a line in the form of a bee in a particular knot he shall understand that the death will take place on the Tithi represented by that knot.

# 37.

Now I shall succinctly mention the time of death. O beloved, listen. On the basis of hearing the sound he shall know the result.

# 38-39.

O woman of slender waist, the calculation of time is based on the division of it into K?ana, Trutf, Lava, Nime^a, Ka;tha, Muhurta, day, night, fortnight, month, season, year, Yuga, Kalpa and Mah&#x26;kalpa.

# 40.

Siva calculates time by three paths: Left, right and middle.

# 41.

Beginning with the fifth and ending with the twentyfifth are the calculations of sound according to the left-hand practices.

# 42.

O fair lady, Bhutarandhra (?) the quarters and the banner are the sounds in the left hand practices.

# 43.

O fair lady, the attributes and the aberrations of the seasons constitute that in the right-hand practices. This shall be known by those who understand the motion of vital airs.

# 44-47.

When Ida and other N£di* respire for five days consecutively, you shall know that the person will die within that year. If these respire for ten days he lives for a year. If they respire for fifteen days he will die after a year. If for twenty days he lives for six months. If the left Nadi respires for twenty five days he lives for three months; if for twentysix days, two months.

# 48.

If it respires for twentyseven days incessantly he lives for a month.

# 49.

This shall be known in accordance with the left-hand practices. If in the right he lives for four days only.

# 50.

O goddess, these sixteen are mentioned as stationed in four places. I shall now mention their extent factually.

# 51.

Beginning with six days and calculating duly it happens as mentioned in the left path.

# 52.

If it respires for six days, he lives for two years eight months and eight days. You shall know that.



---


# 53.

If it respires for seven days he lives for one year, even months and six days, to be sure.

# 54.

If it flows for eight days, he lives for two years, four months and twenty-four days.

# 55.

If for nine days, he lives for three months, twice two months, and twelve days (i.e. seven months and twelve days).

# 56.

The time of the previous days has been mentioned before. But the intervening days of the month may be calculated thus.

# 57.

If for eleven days, he lives for one year nine months and eight days.

# 58.

If for twelve days he lives for one year seven months and six days.

# 59-61.

If for thirteen days he lives for one year four months and twenty-four days. When the Prana flows in the left side for fourteen days he lives for one year, six months and twenty-four days.

# 62.

If for fifteen days he lives for nine months and twenty-four days.

# 63.

If for sixteen days he lives for ten months and twenty-four days.

# 64.

If for seventeen days he dies within nine months. Fond of devotees, eighteen days too are mentioned here.

# 65.

O goddess, if for eighteen days he lives for eight months and twelve days.

# 66-68.

If for twenty-three days, know for certain that he lives for five months i.e. 4 months and 24+6 days = 5 months. If for twenty-four days he lives for three months and eighteen days. All this I have narrated to you in brief.

# Now 69.

This is in accordance with the left hand practices. Listen according to the right hand practices. If the flow is for twenty-eight days he lives for that much period.

# 70.

If for ten days, he dies immediately. If for thirty days he dies in five days.

# 71.

O goddess, if it respires incessantly for thirty-one days, he lives for three days.

# 72.

When Ravi respires thirty-two breaths he lives for two days; there is no doubt in this.

1560

73-74. The right path-practice has been mentioned to you. I shall now tell you about the middle one. The respiration with frequency on one part of the face makes him live for one day. Thus the time for death for a dying person has been mentioned by the experts.

75. O goddess, this Kalacakra pertaining to the dying person has been mentioned to you for the benefit of the worlds. What more do you wish to hear?

# CHAPTER TWENTYSIX

# {The deception or dodging of Kala}

The goddess said:

1. O lord, the perfect knowledge of Kala has been mentioned by you. Now please mention the dodging of Kala by a Yogin, factually. O

2-3. Kala follows upon the track of all creatures. Lord, now taking pity on me, please mention how the Kala that has come does not deceive. O bestower of happiness, please mention it, for the benefit of Yogins.

Siva said: O Goddess Siva listen. I shall explain briefly what I have been asked by you for the benefit of all men.

4. The body is a conglomeration of earth, water, fire, wind and ether. It consists of five elements.

5. The ether is all-pervasive. The elements merge in ether and are reborn therefrom.

6. When the ether is disintegrated the elements resort to their causes. O beautiful woman, there is no stability for this conglomeration.

7. There is no doubt that the wise know all this perfectly through the power of austerity and mantras.

The goddess said:

9. Kala of terrible form, the awful sole lord of the gods, perishes while taking them to die. Even He was burnt.

by you* When eulogised you were pleased and then you revived him to life.

# 10.

Kfila was addressed by you. “In the talk of the people you will be moving about in the invisible form.” He of great power was seen by you there. By means of the boon granted by you he was reborn.

# 11.

Hence there is Kala here. Something is killed by him. Please mention that to me. You are the foremost among Yogins. You are self-controlled lord. O lord Siva, you take up physical bodies for helping others.

Stua said:

# 12.

Kala is not killed by the leading gods, Daityas, Yak$as, Rak?asas, serpents and human beings. But those embodied beings who are Yogins engrossed in meditation can easily kill Kala.

Sanatkumdra said:

# 13.

On hearing this from Siva, the preceptor of the three worlds, Gauri laughed and said “Please tell me the truth. How is this Kala killed? By whom is it killed? Siva told her immediately “O moon-faced lady, those who are sinless Yogins hurl the serpent Kala entirely. Listen to that with concentration."

£iva said: O beautiful lady, the physical body consists of five elements.

# 14.

It arises from them and merges in them. It is always endowed with their attributes.

# 15.

From the ether the wind is produced. From the wind, fire is generated. Water is said to be produced from fire and from it the earth comes out.

# 16-17.

Each of the elements merges into the other in order. Earth has five attributes. Water has four. Fire has three. Wind has only two. Ether has only one. The attributes of the earth and other elements can be mentioned thus.

# 18.

The five attributes are sound, touch, colour, taste and smell. When it is relieved of its attributes the element perishes.

# 19-

When it takes up the attributes the element

1562 StMpmap manifests itself. O goddess, know thus all the elements factually.20 Hence O goddess, the partial attributes shall be thought of by the Yogin assiduously if he is desirous of conquering K&#x26;la.

The goddess said:

1. O lord of the knowers of Yoga, how is Kila wished to be conquered by the Yogins? Is it by meditation or incantations? Please mention everything to me.

Siva said: O goddess, listen. I shall explain it for the fit of the Yogins. The perfect knowledge shall not be imparted to anyone and everyone.

O fair lady, it is to be imparted to the faithful, to the intelligent, to one who is endowed with devotion, to the pious who is not an atheist and to one who is always virtuous.
The knower of Yoga shall practise it taking breath normally sitting on a good bed. If he practises in darkness he shall not keep any lamp. He shall practise when people are asleep.
When the ears are closed with the index finger for a short while a kind of sound is heard as that of a blazing fire.
The practice of Yoga quells all ailments, fevers and many other distressing ills.286
He who visualises the form of death for two Ghatfkas conquers death and lust and can roam about as he pleases.297
He becomes omniscient and omniseer. He attains all Siddhis. If the Yogin hears the sound resembling that of the rain-bearing cloud he becomes rid of worldly bondage immediately. He then becomes the subtlest of all Yogins. O Goddess, thus the order and procedure of the meditation of Sabdabrahman has been narrated to you.

as the seeker of grains eschews husks, he shall eschew bondage.

31. If after attaining the Sabdabrahman he were to aspire for other things he will be hitting the sky with his fist, he will be loving hunger and thirst.

32. After knowing the great Brahman, the cause of salvation, the bestower of happiness, the non-external, the imperishable, freed from all limitations, nothing else need be aspired after.

33. Sinners of crooked intellect deluded by the noose of Kala, fastened into death’s bondage do not realise Sabdabrahman.

34. One remains in the world as long as he has not obtained the supreme abode. When the great reality is understood he is released from the bondage of life.

35-36. After conquering sleep and idleness—the great enemies and the great obstacles and sitting in a comfortable posture one should practise Sabdabrahman for ever. Even if he is an old man of hundred years he will gain health and virility and the power of stopping the decay of the body and of conquering death. He shall then continue the practice as long as he is alive.

37-38. Proof of belief is visible even in an old man. Why not then in a youthful man? O beloved goddess, intelligent persons meditate on the great Siva assiduously for ever. The Sabdabrahman cannot be uttered, cannot be struck at. It is neither OmkSra nor any mantra nor any Bija nor any syllable.

39. Hence the Sabdas are ninefold as explained by those who know the science of breath. I shall explain them assiduously in the proper order according to the Siddhi of Nada.

40. They are Gho?a (sound of the soft consonant) Kamsya (sound of bell metal) Srnga (sound of horn) Gha$t&#x26; (bell) VinS (lute) VamSaja (flute) Dundubhi (drum) SaAkha (conch) and Meghagarjita (the rumbling thunder).

41. After eschewing all these sounds, one shall practise Tumk&#x26;ra? Meditating thus for ever the Yogin is not affected by either virtues or sins.

# 42.

O goddess, what others do not hear the Yogin hears by the practice of Yoga. While practising, if he dies, he may stay in that posture for days and nights.

# 43.

From him the sound of conquest of death rises up in seven days. O goddess, it is of nine varieties. I shall mention it factually.

# 44.

The first sound is Ghosa. It purifies the soul. It dispels sickness. It is excellent. It attracts and controls.

# 45.

The second sound is Karhsya. It stops the movement of living beings. There is no doubt that it stops the effect of poison, evil spirits and evil planets.

# 46.

The third sound is Sfnga. It is employed in black magic for exorcizing enemies and killing them.

# 47.

The fourth is Ghantanada, so says lord Siva. It is one that attracts the gods even. What then of human beings on this earth?

# 48.

Attracted by him the virgins of Yak?as and Gandharvas give him great Siddhis as desired by him or out of their own accord.

# 49.

OVina is the fifth sound. It is heard by Yogins always. O goddess, from it arises the power of vision from a great distance.

# 50.

All principles are understood by one who meditates on VamSa Nada. One who meditates on Dundubhi is devoid of old age and death.

# 51.

O goddess, through the conch sound he assumes any form as he wishes. By means of Megha Nada the Yogin wards off all adversities.

# 52-53.

O pretty lady, is there anything impossible for one who meditates with single-minded devotion the Tumk&#x26;ra form of Brahman? He becomes omniscient and visualiser of all. He moves about assuming any form he wishes. He is not affected by aberrations. He is Siva himself. There is no doubt in this.

# 54.

O goddess, thus the form of Sabdabrahman with its nine aspects has been wholly narrated to you. What else do you wish to hear?

# CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN

# (Escaping death and attainment of Siva)

The goddess said: —

1. A Yogin attains the region of wind arising from the Yogic Ether. O lord, if you are delighted let me hear from you.
2. Formerly, desirous of the welfare of Yogins I had explained everything as to how wind became a symbol for the Yogins desirous of conquering Kala.
3. Knowing the day through that, the Yogin stays engaged in Pranayama. O pretty woman, within half a month he conquers the Kala that has already come upon him.
4. The wind within the heart kindles the fire. It is favourable to the fire. It blows within and without. It is all pervasive. It is great and it spreads everywhere.
5. Knowledge, perfect knowledge, zeal, everything is activised by wind. He who has conquered it has conquered the universe.
6. With a desire to prevent old age and death, the Yogin engaged in the practice of Yoga, meditation and retention shall stay in the state of Dharana.
7. O sage, the blacksmith blows air into the bellows and does his job by means of the wind. The Yogin shall also practise similarly.
8. The lord of thousands, the lord of thousand eyes, hands and feet encompasses the universe and stands ten Angulas above.
9. Holding the breath one shall repeat the Gayatri Mantra along with his Siras (Oiii) and Vyahrtis thrice. That is called Pranayama.
10. Planets like the sun and the moon are evolved and dissolved. But those who are devoted to Yoga and meditation do not return still.
11. O goddess, by a single retention of vital airs, a brahmin attains the benefit accruing to him by the penance.

performed for a hundred years while sustaining himself on the water from the tips of Kuja grass.

12. The brahmin who gets up at daybreak and performs a Pranayama quells his sins and goes to Brahma’s region.

13. Free from lethargy he who is engaged in Pranayama in an isolated place, conquers old age and death, masters the vital air and can traverse the sky.

14. He can assume the form of a Siddha. He gets lustre, intelligence, exploits, valour, happiness and the speed of the wind.

15. O goddess, I have thus narrated the Siddhi through the wind that the Yogin attains from fire.

16. The aspirant sits in the comfortable posture in a place free from noise. In the middle place he illuminates the brilliance accompanied by the lustre of the moon and the sun.

17. The Yogin who illuminates the fire existing between the eyebrows, alertfully can see in darkness without lamps to be sure.

18. The Yogin presses the eyes with the fingers a little and strives to see the star and meditate on it for a muhurta or half that time with concentration.

19. Thereafter while meditating in darkness he sees the bright lustre of Siva in colours white, red, yellow, black and the rainbow colour.

20. On seeing that brilliance on a par with the rising sun stationed in the forehead between the eyebrows, the Yogin can assume any form of body he chooses and plays about as he wishes.

21-22. By repeated practice the Yogin gains various powers—subduing the senses, entry into other bodies, the attainment of eight Siddhis Anima and others, mental vision, hearing from far, perfect knowledge, invisibility assuming multiforms, and the ability to walk through the sky.

23. Persons endowed with Vedic studies, experts in different Shastras and the perfectly wise too become deluded when subservient to the force of the previous Karmans.

They do not see even when they gaze at it; even while listening they are no better than deaf. Deluded by sins they are like blind men in the world.

# 25.

I know the great Puru$a of the colour of the sun beyond all darkness. By knowing him alone can one surmount death. There is no other path to go.

# 26.

Thus the excellent mode of Yoga of the fire has been explained to you, how the Yogin conquers death and attains immortality.

# 27.

I shall now explain a greater method of Yogic practice to ward off death. O goddess, listen with attention and concentration. Yogin, O forms one,

# 28-31.

This goddess, the fourth the other three being the Bhutas, the Yogins and the meditators. This devotee practising the fourth method sits in a comfortable posture in a convenient spot with pure mind. He keeps his body straight. His hands are clasped together cuplike. He shapes the mouth like a beak and drinks in the wind slowly. The water-drops clinging to his palate begin to exude. They are life-givers. He inhales them through the wind. Drinking this nectarine cool water daily he will never be subservient to death. He gets a divine body and great brilliance. He becomes free from hunger and thirst.

# 32.

In strength he becomes equal to an elephant; in speed he vies with a horse; he has the keen sight of Garucja; he can hear from a distance. He has dark curly ringlets of hair. His complexion is as fair as that of Gandharvas and Vidyadharas.

# 33.

He lives for a hundred years by the calculation of the time of gods. He attains equality with Brhaspati. By practising this Yoga he can traverse in the sky or anywhere he likes. He can always remain happy.

# 34.

O fair lady, I shall now explain another mode which is strenuously guarded even by gods. Please listen to it.

# 35.

The Yogin shall practise curving the tongue towards the palate. After sometime he can carry it to the uvula.

*99" Cp VS. 31 . 18 .

36. When touched it begins to exude cool nectar. By drinking in this the Yogin attains immortality.

37. The tip of the tongue touches the tip of the uvula. The hands are clasped in the form of a white lotus. Drawn by him the nectar falls drop by drop. When he attains the great region he delights even the deities. This is the essential substance enabling one to cross the ocean of worldly existence, surmount all sins, cross the Kala along with the star. He by whom the limbs have been drenched with the nectar never dies. He is devoid of hunger and thirst.

38. O daughter of the mountain, the earth possessing these four types of Yogins can bestow happiness on the entire universe. What a man creates in dream the Yogin is competent to create in heaven. This is only a part of what the four can do.

39. Hence the earth united with mantras, penances, Vratas, restraints, medicinal herbs and Yogic practice becomes lovable to men endowed with humility, polity and sacred virtues. The primordial lord of all living beings does not become shaken when associating with the four Yogins. I shall now explain in accordance with the injunctions the Chayapurusa (the shadowy person) who is called Siva.

# CHAPTER TWENTYEIGHT

# The Chdyap urufa

The goddess said:

1-2. O great lord of the gods, the way of dodging Kala has been narrated; the form of Sabdabrahman and the excellent characteristics of Yoga have been mentioned. The reference to the shadow-person has been made by you in brief. Please explain in detail with a desire for the welfare of Yogins.

# Um&#x26;sarhhitd

# Siva said:

3. O goddess, listen. I shall explain the characteristics of the Chayapurusa, on knowing which man becomes released from all sins.

4-5. The aspirant wears garlands and white cloth. He makes himself fragrant with white scents, incense and other things. O fair lady, he then sits with his back to the sun or the moon remembering the great mantra that bestows the benefits of all desires and that consists of the nine units solidified into one. He then glances at his own shadow.

6-7. If he can see the shadow in the sky in a white-coloured form and begins to meditate on Siva, the great cause with single-minded attention, he attains Brahman then. This has been mentioned by the experts. In this state he is rid of Brahminicide and other sins.

8. If he finds the shadow-person headless, the entire power of oral expression of practising Yogin becomes eliminated within six months.

9. If the shadow is white, know that it is an indication of virtue; if it is black, it indicates sin; if it is red, it indicates bondage and if it is yellow it indicates an enemy.

10. If the shadow is devoid of arms it indicates death or ruin of kinsmen; if it is without snout it indicates the fear of hunger; if it is devoid of hips, wife dies; if it is devoid of calves it indicates wealth.

11. If there is no foot, exile to a foreign country takes place. This has been mentioned by me. O great goddess, this shall be carefully considered by the people.

12. (Practising still further and) seeing the shadow-person perfectly and keeping it within the Atman through the Atman, O goddess, the aspirant shall repeat the nine-syllabled Mantra in the heart.

13. If a year passes by there will be nothing that the repeater of the mantra cannot achieve. He attains the eight Siddhis, Anima and others and the ability to walk through the sky.

14. I shall mention another power which is inscrutable but is known to those possessed of perfect knowledge.

15-16. An unknowable figure in the form of a curling

1570 Sioapurif*

Serpent is drawn and that figure placed in the vehicle, nowhere mentioned, is seen there. That which stands uppermost in the universe and that which is eulogised by the Vedas for ever is sung as a secret Vidya and is the mother of all Vidyas.

17. It is the lore of traversing the sky. It is stationed in all living beings. It is visible and invisible. It is immovable, eternal, manifest and unmanifest. It is permanent.

18. It is devoid of colour yet it possesses colour. It is called Bindumalini. The Yogin who sees it always remains contented.

19. On seeing Malini one attains the fruit of all sacrifices, the benefit of charitable gifts and the ceremonial ablutions in all holy centres.

20-21. There is no doubt in this. I mention the truth to you. The man attains the fruit derivable from all sacrifices, O goddess, as well as the benefit of making charitable gifts and taking the ceremonial ablutions in all the holy centres. O goddess, of what avail is speaking much? He attains all cherished desires.

22. Hence a sensible person shall cultivate this knowledge as well as Yoga. Siddhi is attained by practice. Yoga is enhanced by practice.

23. Perfect realization is attained by practice. Liberation is attained by practice. An intelligent man shall always maintain practice. Practice is the cause of salvation.

24. O goddess, I have mentioned that all which bestows the benefit of worldly pleasures and salvation. What other tenet do you propose? Tell me, I shall tell you the truth.

S&#x26;ta said:

25. O great sages, on hearing these words of Sanatkumara, son of Brahma, the words bestowing the knowledge of truth, Vyasa, son of Par&#x26;iara, was much delighted.

26. The extremely delighted Vyasa, bowed again and again to the omniscient son of Brahma, Sanatkumara, the storehouse of mercy.

27. O sages, then the great sage Vyasa, eulogised

Um&#x26;sarhhitd 1571

Sanatkumara, the ocean of the perfect knowledge of the deities.

Vyasa said:

28. O great sage, I am satisfied. The position of Brahma has been assigned to me. Obeisance be to you. You are blessed. You are the most excellent of all knowers of Brahman.

Suta said:

29. After eulogising the great sage the son of Brahma, Vyasa, the grandson of Brahma, kept silent. He was extremely delighted. He was filled with great bliss. Brahma,

30. Saunaka, Sanatkumara, son of took leave of him. Worshipped by Vyasa he returned to his abode. Vyasa too left for his abode with his mind full of delight. O brahmins, thus have described you the

31. conversation between Sanatkumara and Vyasa. It deals with truth. It is pleasing. It enhances knowledge.
