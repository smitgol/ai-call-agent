The sages said

1-3 "How did lord Mahadeva the cause of the annihilation of the universe; assume the hideous and very terrible form called Sarabha? What all daring acts were performed by him? Tell us everything:

Seta said:

Thus requested by Devas; Paramesvara the abode of mercy resolved to curb the powerful lord called Nrsimha. For that purpose he remembered Virabhadra of great strength:

4-5. Virabhadra was the terrible form of himself and the cause of the great Dissolution. Immediately he came smiling in front of the lord at the head of the Ganas. He was surrounded by extremely terrible leaders of the Ganas who were in their crores, who laughed boisterously, who had the forms of lion-like men and who were jumping about:

6-H1_ He was encircled by others also who were of the same number, who had not been seen before; who were joyful and who were playing with Brahma and others of great courage as though with balls. He was saluted by heroes: He had the flames of the fire that occur at the end of the kalpas. He had three shining eyes and he wielded arms. He was embellished by the crescent moon that shone amidst his matted hair: He had two curved fangs that resembled sprouts and had the shapes of two crescent moons. He possessed eyebrows which resembled parts of the bow of Indra (rainbow)- By means of his fierce Humkara (the sound of "Hum") he deafened all quarters. He had the feature of the blue cloud and collyrium. His moustaches were terrible: He had a wonderful form. With his invincible arms he frequently whirled his conquering trident: Lord Virabhadra was uttering in his heroic power. He submitted this to the lord so lord of the universe, command us, What caused you to remember me May favour be granted unto me

The lord said

# 12-16.

A great terrible fear has cropped up untimely unto Devas. The fire of Nrsimha is blazing: He cannot be approached; Subdue him. At the outset console him and make him understand. If he does not become calm thereby, show him my extremely terrible features. Destroy the subtle things by the subtle and the gross things by the gross splendour: At my behest make him realize his duty (or bring him in front of me:)

Ganas

Thus commanded, the presiding deity of the assumed a calm physical form and hastened to the place the Man-lion was present: Thereafter, Virabhadra identical with Siva enlightened Vienu Nrsimha: Like a father unto his bosom-born son Virabhadra spoke these words

# Virabhadra said

# 17-22.

O lord Visnu, you have incarnated for the happiness of the world: You have been engaged by the great Paramesthin for the purpose of sustenance: Multitudes of creatures have been saved by You in the form of a fish: You moved about in the vast Ocean-like sheet of water formerly, after tying up the boat to your tail. You held aloft the Mandara mountain in the form of a tortoise; the earth was lifted up by the Boar. With this leonine form HiranyakaSipu was killed. Again Bali was bound by you in the form of Vamana taking up three steps. You alone are the unchanging lord of all living beings. This is your prowess whenever any misery befalls the world, you take incarnations and make your devotees free from ailments. O lord, devoutly attached to Siva, no one excels you; there is none equal to you:

# 23-24.

Dharmas and the Vedas were established along auspicious lines by you: O lord, the Asura for whom this incarnation was taken has been killed: O lord, your physical form of vaktram Anaya krttin ce ~vaktram mukhat brttim tvacan ca. You bring his heed well his skin. There is a variant krtyem for Erttim which the translation babe adopted here. But this does not suit the content: The translation may be amended according to the NS reading 'Ittim' or 'krtyam.'

Proser to Siva
Manlion is extremely terrible: soul of the universe, kindly withdraw this form yourself in my presence:

Sita said

# 25.

Thus addressed in mild words by Virabhadra, lord Nrsimha (Man-lion) blazed more than before with extremely terrible wrath:

# Lord Nrsinha said

# 26-32.

O dear, go back to that place wherefrom you have come: Do not be presumptuous enough to advise me what is beneficial to me: I shall now annihilate this universe of the mobile and immobile beings. There can't be the annihilation of the annihilator at his own hands or (from others). My sway extends everywhere. There is none to boss over me: Thanks to my favour that everything functions within limits. I alone am the instigator and restrainer of all Saktis. O Ganadhyaksa (presiding deity over the Ganas), know that everything that is glorious, rich, powerful and energetic in the world is a display of my splendour. Those who are conversant with the reality of deities know that I alone am the greatest deity. Brahma, Indra and other Devas who are equipped with power are my parts. The four-faced deity Brahma was born out of my umbilical lotus formerly. The bull-bannered lord originated out of his forehead: The Creator is well-endowed with Rajo-Guna; Rudra is called Tamasa (abounding in Tamo-Guna). I am the restrainer and controller of everything: There is no deity greater than myself:

# 33-35.

I am superior to the universe: I am independent of all: I am the maker and unmaker (annihilator): This is my greatest splendour. Who then wishes to hear your suggestion? Hence, seek refuge in me, be rid of ailments and go back: O great lord of the Bhutas, understand this great feature of mine: O Virabhadra, I am Kala (Time, Death): I am the cause of the destruction of Kala: I am engaged in the activity of annihilation. Know me as Death unto the god of Death: It is due to my favour that these Devas are alive:

885. With minor variations, the verse occurs in the Bhagavad Gita, X.

Snta said:

# 36.

On hearing these baughty words of Nreimha, Virabhadra of unmeasured exploits laughed in derision: With throbbing lips he said thus.

# Virabhadra said:

Don't you know who is the annihilator?

# 37.

Wrdng and disputes will bring in only destruction unto you.

# 38.

Out of your different incarnations what are that remain now? Whatever may be the purpose for which they have been taken; it is only the glory thereof that remains to.

# 39.

See this defect that you have attained such a plight: Within thrice, you will court destruction through Siva who is an adept in annihilation:

# 40.

You are Prakrti and Rudra is Purusa. Power has been induced in you, it is not natural; The five-faced Brahma was born of your umbilical lotus.

# 41.

Brahma who was engaged in a severe penance thought of Sankara within his forehead. It was for effecting creation that he thought of Nilalohita the ancestor of the universe:

# 42.

For the purpose of creation Siva originated from his forehead: That is not disparaging to the lord Siva. I am part of the lord of Devas. I have assumed the form of Bhairava:

# 43-44.

I have been employed to subdue you with humility at the outset, and if that fails, with force afterwards. You are endowed with the digit of his Sakti: Thus, you have torn asunder the Asura. Merely on account of this you are crying hoarse with haughtiness again and again: A help rendered to the wicked is conducive only to a malicious misbehavior.

# 45.

O lion; if you consider Mahedana (lord Siva) to be one born after You, you are mistaken. You are neither the creator nor the annihilator and never independent:

# 46-50.

Like the potter's wheel you have been activised by the Sakti of the Pinaka-bearing lord: O immature one, even now, your skull is strung in the necklace of Siva when you had remained a mere thing of the past, to be remembered merely in rule:

asumed the form of a tortoise. Why don't you understand it? Have you forgotten that your physical form of the Boar was tormented by Skanda, the enemy of Tareke, with an imprecation and curved fang was partially uprooted? O Vievaksene (i.e: Vienu), due to your deception, you have been burned at the tip of his trident. At the sacrifice of Daksa your head was cut off by me even as you had assumed the form of sacrifice: Even today the fifth head of Brahma, your son, has been cut off by me: He is born of your umbilical lotus: His strength is only partial (?) You have been defeated by Dadhicate along with the Maruts in the course of a battle, even as he was scratching his head: How is it forgotten by you?

0 Cakrapani the discus is your favourite weapon, thanks to its exploits. Whence has it been acquired by you? By whom was it made? Even that has been forgotten by you: All your worlds have been seized from you. Overwhelmed by slumber you lie down in the ocean. How then can you be Sittvika? Everything beginning with you and ending with blade of grass is the display of Rudra's Sakti. The fire-god and you, though powerful all round, were deluded: Both of you were incompetent to realize the greatness of his splendour:

Only to the gross intellect appear the great forms of Vispu, Indra, Agni, Yama, Varuna, of heaven and earth: You are born in the belly of the moon; You are Kala. Paramesvara is Mahakala. Mahesvara is Kalakala: Hence, you will become the victim of Death through the burning digit of Ugra (Siva). The lord with steady bow is imperishable, heroic and superior to the universe: He destroys fear of fever. He is the lord of all animals and birds: and gold (?). Neither you nor the four-faced deity can be the overlord and ruler of the entire universe.

889. Virabhadra refers tauntingly to the various forms of Vitnu, Jucb Vimans from Aditi, Jeyents from Indra, Klrttikcy from Agni, Nart-yena from Yama, Bhreu from Varuna and Budha Born Sons, implying thereby the subordinate position of Vitnu:

59-62. Thus viewing everything, restrain and withdraw the Atman through the Atman: Otherwise, death will befall you like the thunderbolt on a stump: You will be the victim of a severe wrath that has the form of great Bhairava.

Sita said Nrsinha who was thus addressed became agitated through anger. He roared and roared and then seized Virabhadra with the force and velocity of his body:

In the meantime, the extremely terrible form of Virabhadra born of the brilliant splendour of Siva manifested itself invincible, spreading through the firmament and causing terror among his enemies:

63. It was not a golden splendour: It was not one pertaining to the moon or the sun nor was it fiery in origin. It was not similar to lightning or the moonlight: It belonged to Mahesvara and it was incomparable:

64. Then all fiery splendours merged into the splendour of Sankara. The highly brilliant and immanent (i.e: Virabhadra) became manifest:

65. He assumed a hideous form characteristic of Rudra: Then Paramesvara became visible in the form of the annihilator.

66. Raising auspicious shouts of victory Devas stood observing: Virabhadra adopted thousand arms. His hairs were matted. The crescent moon adorned his head.

67. Half of his body was an animal. With wings and beak he was a bird: His great curved fangs were very sharp: Adamantine claws were his weapons.

68. He was blue-necked and long-armed, The beak and the feet were born of fire as it were. His majestic roaring sound resembled the terrible thunder of the cloud rising up at the close of a yuga.

69. His three eyes became prominent: His lower lips and curved fangs thundered Humkira.

70-75. At this very sight Nrsimha lost his strength and exploit: He had the same feebleness and flutter as that of a glow-worm.

{lgt. This refers to the Serabha incarnation of Siva. Serabha is an animal with eight legs, stronger than a lion.}

beneath the thousand-rayed sun, Then Virabhadra seized him tying up his legs with his tail and enclosing the region of his arms within his arms. He whirled him [or shook him] with his wings clutching at his umbilicus and feet and hit in his chest: Just as the bird of prey lifts up a serpent and flies high up into the sky so also Virabhadra lifted up Nrsimha. He was followed by Devas and sages out of fright: Sometimes he lifted up Man-lion and sometimes he let him fall down. Soaring high up into the air he struck him with his wings and rendered him unconscious. Devas followed that excellent Virabhadra, lord of the universe, who was carrying off Nrsimha: They eulogised him with obeisance. Even as he was being carried away, Nrsimha in his helpless state eulogised Paramesana (Siva) with palms joined in reverence: His pitiable plight was evident in his face: He eulogised the lord in elegant and graceful words.

# Death of Jalondhara

The sage said:

1. O Romaharsana of good holy rites, it behoves you to tell us how lord Hara the destroyer of the eyes of Bhaga, having matted hair, killed Jalandhara whose exploit was like that of Indra:

Suta said:

There was once an Asura born of the vast sheet of water (ocean): He was known by the name Jalandhara: He resembled the god of death: It was by penance that he acquired his exploits: All Devas including Gandharvas, Yakshas, Nagas and Rakshasas, and even the unborn lord Brahma were defeated by him in battle: After conquering Devas and Brahma, Jalandhara went to the lord of the chiefs of Devas, Vishnu, the destroyer of the universe (?), and the preceptor. A battle ensued between them without respite for a whole night and day:

Lord Vishnu was defeated by him. After defeating Vishnu the lord of Devas, Jalandhara said to the sons of Diti, "To conquer Siva is only justifiable thought: All the rest have been conquered by me in the battle. Only Siva has not been conquered by me: O leading Danavas, after conquering him within a short while along with Nandin and the leaders of the Ganas, I shall distribute among you the position of Siva, Brahma, Vishnu and Indra."

On hearing the words of Jalandhara all those base Danavas roared aloud. Those sinners were eager to face death. Accomp-

anied by these Daityas the powerful Asura set out against Siva, fully equipped with chariots, elephants and horses:

# 1-13.

Siva saw the leader of the Daityas stationed on the peak of the Meru: He had already heard about his indestructibility through others: The destroyer of the eyes of Bhege, the lord and protector of the worlds wanted to keep his promise to Brahma. He was accompanied by Amba and Nandin and his Ganas. He said laughingly: "O lord of Asuras; what purpose shall be served now with a fight?

# 14-16.

You have joyously attempted to die with your limbs pierced and split by my arrows.

On hearing these words that rent his ears, Jalandhara the lord of the army of Asuras spoke thus to the lord of Devas.

"O bull-bannered lord of Devas, having mighty arms, enough of words O Siva, I have come here to fight with you with weapons as bright and piercing as the rays of the moon:

On hearing his words the trident-bearing lord evolved discus, the terrible weapon; by drawing sportingly on the surface of the vast sheet of water with the toe of his leg:

After making the sharp features of the discus on the water-surface of the ocean the lord thought that the three worlds and Devas had been killed by him: The destroyer of Dakga, Andhaka, Antaka, Tripuras, the sacrifice and the annihilator of the three worlds said laughingly:

# 18-19.

O Jalandhara, O Asura, if you are strong enough to lift up the weapon evolved by me by my leg, stand face to face for fighting, and not otherwise" became with

On hearing his words the Asura angry blazing eyes. He looked over the three worlds as though he would burn them with the pair.

Jalandhara said:

23. Within a short while, the three worlds consisting of the mobile and immobile beings were burnt by me: O Rudra, was any lord defeated by you by means of penance?

24. Just as the serpents cannot bear even the odour of Garuda, the lord of the birds, so also Indra, Agni, Yama, Kubera, Vayu, Varuna and others cannot bear me.

25. O Sarkara, neither in the heaven nor on the earth could my arms get a rival. O lord of the Ganas, I have gone to all the mountains and attacked them.

26. Mandara, the lord of the mountains, the glorious Nila, and the splendid Meru have been attacked by me with my staff-like arms. The mountain Meru fell when I scratched it with arms for removing their itching sensation.

27. Just for a sport, the Ganga was restrained with my arms on the mountain Himavan. A group of celestial women was caught and imprisoned by my servants:

28. The mouth of the submarine fire was held by me and choked with the hand: Instantaneously all this was turned into a vast sheet of water:

29. Airavata and other elephants were cast off by me into the water of the ocean: Lord Indra was hurled a hundred yojanas along with his chariot.

Death of Jalandhara

invincible army of the Daityas, consisting of the horses, elephants and Nagas, he did not undergo destruction by the cry glance of the Tripuras. The silly and weak-minded Asura spoke to the lord of Devas thus.

What purpose of mine can be served in the battle the mutual clash of Devas and Asuras? I alone am competent to destroy all these in an instant: I have no fear of fighting: O Isa, this is my earnest desire: Hence, O enemy of Kama, Daksa, Yajna and Tripuras, if you have strength to fight with heroes with the help of leading Bhimas and the monkey-faced Nandin; then you stand here to fight with me.

After saying thus to Mahadeva, the great demon did not move nor did he think of his kins killed in battle:

Urged by evil haughtiness that demon of impolite nature clapped his hands together and then seized the discus called Sudarsana: He attempted to kill Siva with that discus.

O excellent brahmins, he placed the heavy discus on his shoulders with an effort: With that he was pierced into pieces: O brahmins, just as the excellent mountain fell down pierced by the thunderbolt of Indra so also the powerful Daitya fell down dead like a mountain of collyrium:

Instantaneously, the place was covered with his terrible blood: At the behest of Rudra his blood and Alaksh reached Maharaurava hell and lo, it became a deep pit of blood. On seeing Jalandhara killed, Devas, Gandharvas and Pargadas made leonine shouts and cried "O lord well done:

He who reads or listens to this story of the suppression of Jalandhara or he who narrates it duly will attain the leadership of the Ganas.

9. O Purusottama; the lord of the chiefs of Devas, You are our goal. Indeed, you alone are the greatest Atman; you are the father of the worlds. You are the sustainer, annihilator, enjoyer and donor. Hence, O suppressor of Danavas, it behoves you to kill them.

10. Since they have acquired boons, they cannot be killed with any of these arrows and miraculous weapons: such as those belonging to Vishnu, Brahma, Rudra, Yama, Kubera, Soma, Nirrti, Varuna, Vayu, Agni, Varuna, Sun, Isana, and other terrible missiles which make others tremble.

and powerless. O lotus-eyed one, all of them defy death due to their boons. O preceptor of the universe, the blazing Cakra (discus) that belongs to you, and that has originated from the solar disc has been rendered blunt by Dadhica, son of Cyavana. Your staff and bow, your miraculous weapons have been acquired by Daityas through your grace: Formerly, terrible and sharp-pointed discus was evolved by lord Siva, the enemy of the Tripuras in order to kill Jalandhara: It behoves you to kill them with that weapon:

16-19. They can be killed with that weapon and not by any of the hundreds of other weapons.

On hearing their words the discus-bearing lotus-eyed Visnu spoke to those Devas—Brahma and others:

Lord Visnu said:

O Devas, I shall approach lord Siva now along with all the eternal Devas and shall carry out your task in full. O Devas, after acquiring the discus; formerly made by the slayer of the Tripuras in order to kill Jalandhara, I shall kill all the six thousand eight hundred great Asuras and Daityas beginning with Dhundhu. Thus, instantaneously I will redeem all of you, along with your kinsmen.

Seta said:

20-26. After saying this to the excellent Devas; Visnu, the excellent one among Devas, remembered lord Siva and worshipped him. On the splendid summit of the Himavan he duly installed the Linga that resembled the mountain Meru: It had been made by Visvakarman: Repeating the hymn called Tvarita-Rudra and the Rudrasukta he bathed the Linga and worshipped it with scents: It was charming in its fame-like form. He eulogised Rudra; worshipped him in the free and bowed down to him. Repeating the thousand names in order he worshipped lord Siva: Each name began with Prapave and ended with Namah (obeisance): The first name among the thousand was Bhava: With every name he worshipped Sankara Mahesvara, with a lotus. Once, with sacrificial twigs he performed ten thousand Homas for every name beginning with Bhava. He duly performed the Homa, repeating the word.

In fact, the name exceeds the required number. In order to arrive at One thousand names, ST treats some substantives and adjectives and excludes them from the list of names. For example, in 'bhavaye sivaya namah', 'bhavaye' is used as an adjective qualifying 'Sivaya' and not included in the list of one thousand names. Our translation does not follow ST in this respect.

Siveh-Siva is the fourth (turiya) state of the soul in which the other three states meet, noting their identity - cited in ST. Cf, also Ahobak cited in ST.

Sthanuh-gmenagemanalunyah cited in ST.

Suta said:

Thus he eulogised the bull-bannered lord with his thousand names. The lord (i.e. Visnu) bathed Siva and worshipped him with lotus flowers. In order to test Visnu, Mahesvara the lord of the worlds hid one of the lotus flowers intended for the worship. Visnu from whom the flower was taken away thought thus, 'What is this?'

After realising the loss of the flower Visnu plucked out his eye and devoutly worshipped the preceptor of the universe, the support of all beings. He worshipped him repeating the last name of the lord:

cended from that zone of fire938 immediately:

164-166. On seeing the lord of Devas, Viequ became glad and paid obeisance to him. The lord was embellished with matted hair as if with a crown. He resembled a hundred million suns. He was divine and surrounded by clusters of flames: He was terrible with sharp fangs. He was holding the trident, axe, iron club, discus, javelin and noose: He showed gestures of granting boon and protection with his hands. He wore the hide of a tiger as his upper garment: He was adorned with Bhasman.

167. Devas including Indra rushed in and circumambulated him. The world of Brahma shook and the earth quaked:

168. The splendour of lord Siva burned everything within a hundred yojanas on all sides, beneath and above: There was a roar "Ha ha" on the earth's surface.

169. Glancing lovingly at Visnu who stood aside with palms joined in reverence; Sankara, Mahadeva said smilingly:

170. O Visnu, the task of Devas has been well understood by me: I shall give you the splendid discus Sudarsana.

171. O deity of good rites, it was indeed for your welfare and for your strenuous deliberation that I assumed this form terrific for the worlds which you have seen just now.

172. O Visnu, peace and tranquillity in the battlefield is the cause of your misery. The weapon of a calm one shall also be calm: What indeed is the benefit from a calm and peaceful weapon? The weapon of a quiescent person is quiescence which is the weapon of the ascetics:

173. To Kshatriya warrior there is destruction of strength due to quiescence: It increases the strength of the enemy.

174. Imagine and meditate on my unchanging form which was seen by the agitated Devas: What can be done with a weapon, O destroyer of the enemies of Devas in order to fight?

175-176. O destroyer of the enemies of Devas, in order to fight, one shall not evince forgiveness in the battle, when weakness has passed away or not yet come in. It should not be practised towards one's own people at improper times, and when unrighteousness and calamities have disappeared.

saying thus he gave him the discus that had the lustre of ten thousand suns:

177. The lord; the leader of the worlds, gave him an eye also resembling the lotus. Ever since then they call that deity of good holy rites "Padmakea" (lotus-eyed)

178. After giving the eye and discus, thus to Visnu, lord Siva touched him with his auspicious hands and said:

179. "O excellent Visnu, I am the bestower of boons: Choose the desired boons. I have been captivated by you by your devotion; to be sure."

180. On being urged thus by the lord of Devas, Visnu bowed down to the lord of Devas and said: "O Mahadeva, bless me with this excellent boon of devotion to you:

181-182. I do not wish for anything else, O lord, because devotees do not have any other desire."

On hearing his words the merciful lord with the moon for ornament touched him and granted him faith: Mahadeva spoke thus to Visnu the great soul.

O lotus-born deity, the divine hymn mentioned by me is splendid: He who reads this or listens to this or narrates this to excellent brahmins will attain the benefit of having gifted a piece of gold at every name.

How was her marriage with him? It behoves you to narrate all this to us now.

On hearing their words, Suta the most excellent among the Pauranikas, narrated the birth of the great goddess to those noble-souled ones.

Sita said: It was at the outset mentioned to Dandin in detail by Brahma; it was then mentioned to Kumara (Sanat) by him. Then it was mentioned to Vyasa, the intelligent sage. I have heard it from him and I am now recounting it to you all in detail: O highly blessed ones, at your entreaty I shall mention it to you after bowing down to Uma and Siva:

She is the mother of the universe: She is named Bhaga. She is the three-fold pedestal of the deity in the form of Linga.

14. At that time, her name was Sati: She resorted to Rudra alone as her husband: In course of time, she rebuked Daksa. The goddess then became the daughter of Mena.

15-20. It was due to the curse of Narada that Daksa also was prompted to censure them: The haughty Daksa, dishonoured the lord of Uma contemptuously. When Sati came to know of this action of her father Daksa, by her yogic power.

the splendid and charming peak of the Himalayas, the famous and splendid holy centre Kanakhala was that spot: This lordly Virabhadra was sent by Paramesthin (i.e. lord Siva) in order to destroy it. At that time there were portentous calamities indicating fear of danger to the world:

1. The mountains crumbled; the earth quaked; the winds whirled to and fro and the ocean became agitated:
2. The fires did not blaze; the sun did not shine; the planets were not illuminated: Neither Devas nor Danavas looked pleased: Then, trice, Bhadra entered the sacrificial yard accompanied by ganas born of his hairs: He was like black fire: He spoke to Daksa of unmeasured splendour: "O Daksa, I have been sent by the Pinaka-bearing lord to burn you today along with the leading sages by mere contact of mine: After saying this the leading Gapa burnt that sacrificial chamber:
3. The infuriated leaders of the Gapas uprooted the sacrificial posts and hurled them about along with the Hotf and Prastotr. They burned everything:
4. The lords of the Ganas seized them and cast them into the running current of the Ganga. Virabhadra of great splendour and undistressed soul made the hands of Indra and other Devas stunned as they raised them. He uprooted the eyes of Bhaga sportively with the tip of his finger: With his fist he hit the teeth of Pusan and made them fall. He kicked the moon with the toe of his foot: He cut off the head of lord Indra. After cutting off the hands of Agni and after uprooting his tongue sportively he kicked him on his head with his leg:
5. He cut off the staff of Yama. He hit lord Isana, a guardian of the quarters of great strength by means of his trident. Without any difficulty he killed thirty-three Devas thus. Sportingly he killed three thousand three hundred and thirty.

Three Devas along with the three leading Devas. He killed leading sages too. This lord killed those Devas who stood in readiness for fighting: Lord Rudra hit them with his swords, arrows and other things. Then Visnu of great splendour and intensified strength lifted up his discus, and fought with Rudra. A terrible fight ensued between them. It made hairs to stand on end.

25-30. Thanks to his yogic power, innumerable and divine bodies with conch, discus and iron clubs in their hands were born of Visnu. They were equal to him in lustre. Lord Virabhadra killed all of them by means of his iron club and hit Visnu on the head. Then he sportively hit him on the chest; he fell senseless on the ground. The lord got up again and lifted up his discus to kill him. He stood there gloriously with his eyes reddened with anger. Virabhadra of undistressed tul stunned his terrible discus that had the lustre of black sun and which he had kept in his hand: He did not move: He stood stunned thereby motionless like a mountain.

31. The bow of the lord was attacked with three hits and it split into three: Through contact with the tips of the bits of the bow he cut off the head of the lord.

32-37. His head that was cut off fell quickly into the nether worlds wafted by the wind originating from the Pinaka-bearing lord. At that time the Ahavaniya fire too entered there. On seeing the great sacrificial hall utterly in disarray with the sacred vessel destroyed, sacrificial posts broken along with the arched gateway, and the great hall burned, sacrifice fled: As it fled towards the sky in the guise of a deer, Virabhadra seized and beheaded it. Thereafter the powerful Virabhadra kicked the following on their heads, viz. - Prajapati; Dhara, Kasyapa the preceptor of the universe; Aristanemi the leading sage with his ten, sage Angiras, Krmasva and the renowned Dakta: O excellent brahmins, be cut off Daksa's head and burned it in the fire.

He stood in their midst, covered with glory like Siva in the cremation ground:

In the meantime Brahma of great splendour bowed down to him and imploringly addressed Bhadra thus: "O Bhadra, enough of your wrath. All the heaven-dwellers are already destroyed: deity of good holy rites, be pleased. May everybody be forgiven by you along with those born of your hairs."

Thanks to the influence of Brahma, Paramesthin; he gradually calmed down: At his behest he became quiescent.

The bull-emblemed lord Siva appeared in the firmament accompanied by his Ganas. On being requested by lord Brahma, the great lord of all the worlds, the bestower of everything gave back their own respective bodies to those who were killed. He gave back the head to Indra, to Visnu, to Daksa and to the leading sages and others. He gave back the tip of the nose to the goddess Sarasvati and to the mother of Devas. He gave back life to all those who were destroyed: He granted them boons and presents: He sportively made another face similar to the head of Daksa whose face had been destroyed.

Daksa regained consciousness and got up. With joined palms he eulogised the bull-bannered lord of the chiefs of Devas. On being eulogised by him, the lord of great splendour granted him different boons. He bestowed the chieftaincy of Ganas upon Daksa of undistressed activities: Devas eulogised lord Narayana with palms joined in reverence: Brahma and the sages severally eulogised the bull-bannered, blue-necked lord who was the chief of Devas, and the cause of the origin of Brahma. After blessing those Devas, the supreme lord vanished.

The head of Daksa, that was smashed by Virabhadra, was substituted by Siva with the head of a sacrificial animal.

The sages said:

1. How did the mother goddess, the splendid Sati become the daughter of the lord Himavan? How did she attain Siva, lord of the chiefs of Devas as her husband?

2. That excellent lady by her own will resorted to the body of Mena. By practising penance she was born as the daughter of Himavan:

3-7. The lord of the mountains celebrated her post-natal and other rites. When she attained twelfth year she performed penance: Along with her, her younger sister of splendid face too performed the penance. Both the sisters were different entities: She was bowed to by all the worlds. The sages surrounded her and eulogised her for her penance. She was called Aparna and her younger sister of splendid face was called Ekaparna. The third excellent sister was Ekapatala. The supreme lord Siva was captivated by her penance:

8. In the meantime, there was an asura of great splendour, named Taraka. He was the son of Tara:

12. A fierce, thrilling fight ensued between them. It lasted a thousand divine years without intermission, both by day and night:

13. Seizing Visnu along with his chariot, he hurled him a hundred yojanas away. Defeated in battle by Tara, the Garuda-bannered Visnu fled.

15-16. The lord of the chiefs of Daityas conquered Devas along with their chief; Indra. With his Maya, he prevented Devas from functioning as lords of the worlds. Devas along with Indra were afflicted with fear. Although they were heroic, they never attained peace: Afflicted with fear, they never got refuge: Then the glorious lord of the immortal beings

17. rushed to Angirasa and said in the presence of Devas:

18. "So sir, the great Danava Taraka is the son of Tara. We have been overpowered by him as calves by the lordly bull:

19. O highly blessed one, O Brhaspati; Devas whirl about here and there like birds in a cage: They have no fixed abode: In the great fight they have been defeated and are now afraid of him. Due to the power of this demon, excellent Angirasa,

20. of ours which failed before have now all those weapons never become futile:

21-24. This demon fought with Visnu, O Brhaspati, for twenty thousand years and still he has not been killed by him: Since he has not been defeated in battle even by the powerful Visnu, how can people like us stand in front of him in battle?"

Thus requested by Indra, Brhaspati, the preceptor of Devas, approached lord Brahma along with the thousand-eyed Indra as well as other leaders of Devas: He spoke to him. Brahma, the dispeller of the agony of his devotees, heard everything orally conveyed by him with love: Then he spoke to Brhaspati in the presence of Devas including Indra:

25-30 "I know your distress, O leading Devas. Still, listen now. Sati, the goddess born of Rudra's body rebuked Daksha."

On being remembered by the preceptor of Devas, Kama came along with his wife Rati. With palms joined in reverence; he spoke to Brhaspati sitting along with Indra, O excellent brahmins.

3-38. "O Brhaspati, since I am remembered by You I have come here in your presence: Tell me what I have to do. Thus, he who was summoned by Brhaspati spoke to him.

Take adequate steps for the same along with your wife Rati. Mahadeva, if pleased, will grant you excellent boon. He is already separated from her: On acquiring Uma the daughter of the lord of the mountain he will be delighted: On being told thus, Kama bowed to Indra the lord of Saci and of Devas and decided to go to the penance grove of the lord of Devas in the company of Rati.

39-46. He was accompanied also by Vasanta his comrade: He decided to join the lord with Parvati: Beholding Kama laughingly, the lord stared at him contemptuously. Then the fire blazed forth from his third eye and burned Kama as he stood by his side. Rati then cried piteously. On hearing her lamentations, the bull-emblemed lord was overwhelmed by mercy. He looked at her mercifully and said: "O gentle lady, it is true that...

The penance %f Uma

10. On seeing the great lord come there in the guise of a brahmin, she could recognize him as the lord through her intelligence: She bowed to the bull-bannered lord.

11. Alter worshipping the boon-bestowing lord who had come there in the guise of a brahmin, she eulogised him.

12-16. Preserving the traditional practice of the noble-souled mountain; the lord blessed the goddess and said laughingly. Moreover, Siva, the lord of all Devas wanted some fun in the midst of the good elite. So great goddess, I shall, assuming gentle form, meet you at the celebration of Your Svayamvara. After saying this the lord looked at her with a divine vision and went away: She too returned home. On seeing the goddess come back Himavan, along with Mena (his wife) became delighted: He embraced her in her ascetic garb and kissed her on the head. Without knowing what had been whispered to his daughter by the lord of Devas, he announced publicly to hold the Svayamvara celebration of his daughter:

17-22. Then all these came to attend the Svayamvara celebration of the daughter of the mountain lord.

Even as the goddess was stationed in the midst of Devas holding the dower garland, the bull-emblemed lord Mahadeva took the form of an infant just for the sake of fun: The lord slept on the lap of the goddess.

29-32. Devas saw the infant in "Who is this infant here?" They were greatly agitated: Indra, the slayer of Vrtra, lifted up his arm and brought forth his thunderbolt: The hand that was lifted remained stunned by the will of the lord of Devas who was in the form of an infant: Indra could not hurl his thunderbolt nor could he shake his arm. Agni too stood similarly and could not hurl his Sakti.

33. Yama could not wield his staff: O leading sages, Nirrti could not wield his sword. Varuna could not use his weapon Nagapasa (serpentine noose). Samirana (wind god) could not wield the staff of his banner.

34-35. The following persons lifted up their respective weapons (but could not use them): Soma (Moon) lifted up his iron club and stood (motionless); Dhanesa the most excellent among staff-bearers lifted up his staff (and stood motionless); similarly, Isana lifted up his sharp trident and stood motionless; the Rudras too lifted the trident; the Adityas their threshing rod and the Vasus their Mudgara (iron-club): But all these heaven-dwellers were immediately rendered stunned and motionless by the lord:

36-37. Similarly, other heaven-dwellers too were rendered stunned by the lord of Devas: Shaking his head, Visnu lifted up his discus and stood ready to strike. The hair on his head became steady. He could not hurl his discus nor could he move his arms.

38. The deluded Pusan gnashed his teeth on glancing at the boy. The moment he was looked at by Siva, his teeth fell down.

39-40. Similarly, the lord curbed their strength, splendour and yogic power: Now, even as those Devas who were infuriated were stunned and rendered motionless, Brahma who was highly dejected meditated on Siva and understood that it was lord Isana lying on the lap of Uma.

Thus, when people from all places had assembled, Visnu himself led the daughter of the lord of the mountains into that city. She was fully bedecked and had smiles on her face: Then Brahma spoke to Visnu, Narayana the lord of Devas, in that assembly.

# 39.

O lord, You were born at the outset from the left side of Rudra, along with Bhavani and other deities: I was born from his right side:

# 40.

Indeed; Himavan the lord of the mountains was created for the purpose of sacrifice: He is my own form. This daughter of Himavan was born by the grace of Brahma's power.

# 41.

The lord has come here for the proper functioning of the rites laid down in the Vedas and the Smrti texts as well as for the sake of marriage rites. Hence, the goddess is the mother of the worlds: The lord is my creator as well as yours.

# 42.

The universe is created by the cosmic forms of this lord Rudra since the lord has the eight forms of earth, fire, water, ether, wind, moon, sun and the hotf.

# 43-45.

Still, at the instance of the lord of the mountains as well as at my instance this unborn Prakrti of white, black and red colour should be given to Siva: You too are the Prakrti: The alliance with the king of the mountains is conducive to your welfare as well as mine: In the Padma Kalpa, I was born of your umbilical lotus.

"This daughter of Mena and my younger sister now belongs to you by matrimonial rite." Saying thus, he dedicated the goddess to the lord of Devas along with water: Visnu too offered himself to the lord along with water. Then the excellent sages who were masters of the Vedic texts said: "On consideration, it is indeed this lord Siva who is the giver, the receiver of the material offered and the benefit thereof: Of course, through his Maya has emanated the universe from him." Saying this they bowed down to him: The hair on their skins stood on end due to pleasure: The heaven-walkers - Siddhas and Caranas showered flowers on him.

# 52.

The divine drums were sounded. The Apsarases danced: The Vedas assumed physical forms and bowed down to the great lord: Along with Brahma and the sages bowed down to the lord of Uma and of Devas. The lord glanced at the bashful daughter of the snow-clad mountain. He was never satiated. She, splendid and unblemished body, was not satiated on seeing the bull-bannered lord. He spoke to Visnu: "I am the bestower of boons:" He too then spoke to Sankara.

Thereupon, Brahma again spoke to the lord: "I now offer Havis to the holy fire; officiating as a priest at the sacrifice.

The glory of Sakti
Thercup on; Brahma the grandfather of the world, became delighted in his mind. He bowed to the lord, and joined the hand of the goddess to the hand of the lord: The fire-god himself was present there with palms joined in reverence: Brahma performed the Homa duly chanting Mantras taken from the Vedic texts. The mantras had assumed physical forms and were present there. He offered the fried rice in the due order. After worshipping the brahmins brought by Visnu he blessed them with different boons. He then made the lord circumambulate the holy fire thrice. In the presence of Devas and men the joined hands were separated joyously. Lord Brahma then bowed to the husband of Uma, the lord of Devas. He offered Padya, Acamaniya, Madhuparka and a cow to the couple. Again, Lord Brahma bowed down to Siva and stood aside along with Devas headed by Indra.

The sages beginning with Bhrgu showered gingelly seeds and whole rice grains. The sun and the rest of luminaries worshipped and eulogised the bull-bannered lord.

Siva concluded the sacred Vedic rites, and imposed the fire on to the Atman: He was thus united with her for the welfare of the worlds. He who reads or listens to this nuptial of Rudra, or he who smilingly narrates this to brahmins who have mastered the Vedas and the Vedangas, attains the chieftaincy of the Ganas and rejoices with Siva. Wherever this narrative is repeated and glorified by the brahmins, the lord occupies that place as long as the story continues. Hence; O brahmins, O excellent brahmins, in the course of the celebration of the marriage of leading brahmins and Kaatriyas, the lord should be duly glorified after the worship and not otherwise:

Thus excel-

lent detailed account of the marriage of Siva-Uma should be glorified: After the marital rites with the goddess the daughter of the lord of the Himavan, the bull-bannered lustrous lord went to the divine city Varanasi, accompanied by Devas, Ganas and also Nandin:

Uma whose face beamed with delight bowed down to the bull-bannered lord who was comfortably seated in Avimukta. She asked him about the glory of that holy centre:

The lord who bore the crescent moon on his forehead recounted the greatness of the holy centre: O goddess of Devas, the greatness of Avimukta cannot be recounted by me in detail: This holy centre is honoured by the sages. O fair lady, how shall I tell you in detail the merits of Avimukta?

Sinners who die here shall be liberated even in their very birth: A man dispels at Varanasi the sins he has committed elsewhere: The sins committed at Varanasi turn the sinner into Pisaca and they lead him to hell: It is better for men to court Pisacahood after committing thousands of sins at Varanasi than to attain the position of Indra a thousand times in heaven without the pleasure of being in the city of Kasi: No living animal is reborn if it dies in this place where the lord VisveSvara, the lord of Orkara, the lord clad in elephant's hides, is ever present: After recounting the glory of the holy centre briefly the moon-crested lord dismissed the leaders of Ganas and pointed out a garden to the goddess. It was here that lord Vinayaka, the deity with the face of an elephant, was born, for creating obstacles in the way of Daityas and for dispelling the same in the way of heaven-dwellers. Thus, the entire essence of the story has been narrated to you: It is a splendid story and I have narrated just as it had been heard by me by the grace of Vyasa.

You are prayed to by those who are harmful and injurious to Devas, for the achievement of their desire: Hence, bless us with a good cause of impediment to those who bring about injury to Devas. This alone is our request."

7. On hearing that, the Pinaka-bearing lord of Devas, Siva created the body of the leading Deva Ganesvara.

8-10. The leading Ganas and the lords of Devas eulogised Mahesvara, the origin of the world and the splendid dispeller of the distress of worldly existence: Then Ambika welcomed the elephant-faced lord Gajanana, the cause of the origin of the world, the wielder of the trident and noose. Siddhas and sages showered flowers. The heaven-walkers, the groups of Devas eulogised lord Mahesa, the bestower of the cherished desires. The lords of Devas bowed to Ganesa and Mahesa alertfully.

19. O Vinayaka, it behoves you to bestow equality with You, on those men and women who worship you on all occasions.

20. O boy Ganesvara, protect your devotees with all efforts: On being worshipped here and hereafter protect old people and those who are in the prime of their youth.

21. O Vighnesvara, O Ganesvara, everywhere in the three worlds, you alone will undoubtedly become worthy of being worshipped and honoured.

22. O son, even when the brahmins worship me, as Narayana or Brahma or when they perform sacrificial rites you will be worshipped at the outset.

23. If anyone performs auspicious rite laid down in the Srutis or Smrtis of any worldly ceremony without worshipping you at the outset; it will be turned inauspicious.

24. O Gajanana, you are worthy of being worshipped by brahmins, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras by the offerings of splendid edibles and food-stuffs for the achievement of all Siddhis. There is nothing to be achieved by Devas and others anywhere in the three worlds without first worshipping you with scents, fragrant flowers and incense.

Tindava dance of Siva

Thus, every detail connected with the nativity of Gapesa, Skanda's elder brother, has been recounted to You. He who reads this, listens to this or narrates this shall be happy.

# CHAPTER HUNDRED AND SIX

# The Tandava dance of Siva

The sages said:

1. We have heard about the nativity of the elder brother of Skanda. It behoves You now to tell us precisely wherefore and how Lord Siva begins his Tandava dance:

Siva said:

Daruka born in the family of Asuras attained heroism through his penance. Like the fire at the end of a Yuga he killed Devas as well as Brahmins.
Devas were extremely afflicted by Daruka: They sought refuge in Brahma, Isana, Kumara, Venu, Yama and Indra. Knowing that the Asura could be killed only by a woman; he was confronted in a battle by Indra and others in fine guises of women: Still they were overwhelmed by him.
O Brahmins, they approached Brahma and acquainted him with everything: Accompanied by Brahma they approached the lord of Uma. With Brahma at the forefront; they eulogised him. Approaching the lord of Devas and bowing to him in diverse ways Brahma said: "O lord, the demon Daruka is a terrible fellow. We have been defeated by him at the outset. It behoves You to protect us by killing Daruka who is destined to be killed by a lady."

On hearing this submission the lord who destroyed the eyes of Bhaga, said laughingly to the goddess, the daughter of the mountain-lord:

For brahmadyaih read lukridyeih: The former reading does not suit the context.

11. She entered the lord of Devas the most excellent Deva only in part. But Brahma and Devas such as Indra and others did not know this.

12. On seeing the splendid daughter of the lord of the mountains stationed by the side of the lord as before, even the omniscient four-faced lord Brahma was deluded by her Maya.

13. Having entered the body of the lord of Devas, Parvati made her own body out of poison in the neck of the lord.

14. On coming to know of this the enemy of Kama (i.e. Siva) created Kali the blue-necked goddess with matted hair from his third eye:

15. When the black-necked goddess was born the glory of victory too originated: Now Bhavani and Paramesvara were sure to inflict defeat over the demon.

16. On seeing Kali who resembled fire and whose black neck was embellished with poison, taking her origin, Devas and Siddhas, the chief of whom were Visnu, Brahma and Indra, due to fright: manifested itself in forehead,

21. Bhava assumed the form of a boy due to his power of Maya and stationed himself in the cremation ground full of corpses and ghosts. Isvara, then cried in order to quell the fire of her anger. Seeing the boy, who was actually Isana, the goddess was deluded by his Maya. She took him, kissed him on his head and suckled him at her breasts.

22. Along with her breast-milk the boy quaffed up her warmth also and he became the protector of the holy centres.

23. He assumed eight physical forms for his manifestation as the intelligent protector of holy centres. Thus, her excessive anger was ceased by that boy.

24-28. In order to propitiate her, the delighted trident-bearing lord of Devas performed the tandava dance at dusk, along with the ghosts and leaders of goblins. After quaffing the nectar-like dance of Siva up to the throat, after enjoying the dance of Siva very much, Paramesvari danced in the midst of ghosts, happily along with yoginis: Devas all round, including Brahma, Indra and Visnu, bowed to and eulogised Kali and then prayed to the goddess Parvati: Thus, the Tandava of the trident-bearing lord has been briefly mentioned to you. Others are of the opinion that the Tandava of the lord is due to the Bliss of yoga.

# 582 Lingapurana

When the three-eyed lord went away after creating Kahi thus, Upamanyu worshipped him by performing penance and acquired the benefit of worship:

0 excellent brahmins, there was a sage known as Upamanyu: He was as refulgent as Karttikeya. Once while playing about in the hermitage of his maternal uncle, he got only a small quantity of milk while his uncle's son drank a good quantity of excellent milk maliciously: On seeing him drinking milk as much as he pleased, Upamanyu spoke to his mother. "O mother, O highly blessed mother, O ascetic woman, give me cow's sweet milk, which should be hot and not too little in quantity. I am bowing down to you."

Thus fondly requested, the mother earnestly embraced her son. O brahmins, recalling again and again to his mind the milk, the highly refulgent Upamanyu lamented to her and said, "Give me, give me milk."

That sweet-voiced lady ground some seeds she had gathered by gleaning one by one: She then stirred the grounded paste with water and then lovingly called her son gently and said, "Come, come on, my dear son." The distressed lady embraced the boy tenderly and gave him the artificial milk she had prepared: excellent brahmins, drinking the artificial milk.

O boy, on given by his mother, he became dejected and said, "O mother, this is not milk."

On observing this she became unhappy: With her hands she wiped her son's lotus-like wide eyes. She kissed him on the head and said: "There is a river full of jewels within the range of heaven and nether worlds. Those who are unfortunate, being devoid of devotion to Siva do not perceive it:

Such persons do not obtain kingdom, heaven, salvation and the diet of milk. They do not achieve pleasing things unless Bhava is satisfied with them:

# The Story of Upamanyu

14. Everything results from the grace of Bhava and not from the grace of other deities. Those who are devoted to other deities are miserable; confused and bewildered.

15-18. Whence can we get milk? We have not worshipped Mahadeva. O son, only that can be achieved, which has been gifted after exalting Siva and not by exalting Vishnu or any other lord:

On hearing the words of his mother, Upamanyu of great refulgence, despite his being a boy, bowed down to his mother who was piteously miserable, and said: "O highly blessed lady, eschew your sorrow: If there exists Mahadeva anywhere, sooner or later I shall obtain the milk ocean."

Seta said: After bowing to her and saying thus, he began to get ready to perform penance.

19. The mother then said to him, "Perform the splendid penance perfectly." On being permitted by her, he performed a very severe penance:

20. He went to the mountain Himavan. With great attention and concentration, he took in only wind as food. Due to his penance, the universe became agitated:

21-24. The excellent Devas bowed down to mention everything to him. On hearing their words, lord Vishnu thought, "What is this?" On deep consideration, he realized the cause. With a desire to see Mahesvara, he hastened to the Mandara mountain. On seeing the lord, he joined his palms in reverence, bowed down to him and said: "O lord, a certain brahmin boy known as Upamanyu, for the sake of milk, burnt everything by means of his penance: Curb him."

On hearing their petition, the Pinaka-bearing lord resolved to go there in the disguise of Indra.

25. Having assumed the form of Indra, the king of immortal beings, he went to the penance grove of the sage riding on the white elephant. He was accompanied by Devas, Asuras, Siddhas, and Nagas:

26. Indra was accompanied by Saci and he mounted the elephant: The sun held the fan in his left hand and the white umbrella in the other:

# Lingapurana

27. With his white umbrella; lord Sadasiva who had assumed the form of Indra and was accompanied by Uma [in the form of Saci] shone like the Mandara mountain with the disc of the moon above it:

28. Having assumed the form of Indra like this, the lord went to the hermitage of Upamanyu in order to bless him:

29-30. "Today my hermitage has been sanctified since Indra, the lord of Devas and of the universe, has come here along with the sun god" 0 excellent sages, so said Upamanyu; on seeing lord Siva in the guise of Indra. He bowed down his head.

31. On seeing that the brahmin boy after saying thus, stood aside with palms joined in reverence, lord Siva in the guise of Indra said in a majestic tone:

32. "0 highly intelligent sage of good holy rites, 0 elder brother of Dhaumya, I am delighted with you for your penance. Tell me the boon you wish to choose: I shall give you all desired things urged by Indra," said the excellent sage who was thus to Siva with palms joined in reverence: "I choose devotion."

34. On hearing the words of the sage, Lord Isana himself in the guise of Indra said excitedly as if he was angry:

35. "0 celestial sage, you do not know me, the lord of Devas. I am Indra the overlord of the three worlds; bowed to by all Devas.

36. 0 brahmin sage, be my devotee: Worship me always. I shall give you everything; Welfare unto you. Leave off Rudra devoid of attributes."

37. On hearing the words of Indra that rent his ears, Upamanyu said thus after repeating the splendid five-syllabled mantra Om namas Sivaya:

38. "I think some base Daitya has come here in the guise of Indra, in order to create obstacles in my holy rites: It cannot be otherwise:

39. Every quality has been mentioned by you while engaged in censuring Bhava. Incidentally, the state of his being devoid of attributes has been extolled:

979. PIvitef ciremah: We have adopted the N.S. reading.

# Th stor %f Upamanyu

40. Of what avail is much talk? I know that I have committed a great sin in my previous birth. For I am compelled to hear the censure of Bhava:

41. On hearing the censure of Bhava, one must kill the person who censures; immediately and cast off his body at the very instant: He shall thereby go to the world of Siva.

42. He, who plucks out the tongue of the person who is engaged in censuring Siva verbally, uplifts twenty-one generations of his family and goes to the world of Siva.

43. O base one, let alone my desire for milk: I shall leave off my body after killing you by the missile of Siva.

44. Undoubtedly what had been mentioned by my mother was true: The lord has not been worshipped by us in the previous birth.

45. After saying this boldly to the lord, Upamanyu the knower of mantras resolved to kill Indra by means of the Atharva missile: refulgence took.

46. The sage of great brilliance took a handful of Bhasma from the receptacle: Then, he discharged the Atharva missile against him and roared:

47. The sage of great brilliance, the unchanging soul meditated on the lord, invoked the Dharana of Agni, and got ready to burn his body like the dry fuel:

48. When the brahmin boy attempted this, the lord, the destroyer of the eyes of Bhaga, prevented him by means of the missile of Soma.

49. The missile of that resembled the Atharva that sage Kalagni was withdrawn by Candraka (moon) missile at the instance of Nandin: assumed his own form with the crescent moon at his crest.

50. Then lord Paramesvara showed himself to the brahmin boy, the following appeared, viz:

51-52. All round the ocean of curd, thousands of milk currents, the milk ocean, the ocean of ghee, the ocean of fruits, the ocean of various edibles and food-stuffs and mountains of Apupas: the smiling.

53. The merciful lord looked smilingly at the daughter of the mountain. He then sympathetically looked at Muk the tectarian attitude of this purana.

Upamanyu who was surrounded by his kinsmen. The lord then said: "O dear Upamanyu: Enjoy all pleasure as you desire in the company of your kinsmen: O highly blessed one, this Parvati is your mother:

You have been adopted as my son now. Hence, this ocean of milk, the ocean of honey, the ocean of curds, the ocean of rice soaked in ghee, the ocean of fruits and lambatives, the ocean of edibles and foodstuffs and also mountains of baked pies. Your father is Mahadeva who is the father of the worlds. Undoubtedly your highly blessed mother is the mother of the universe:

Immortality is bestowed upon you: So also the perpetual chieftaincy of the Ganas. Choose your boons; you shall not hesitate in this matter. I shall give you whatever you ask for.

After saying thus, Mahadeva lifted him with his hands. Lord Bhava kissed him on the head and handed him to the goddess. O excellent brahmins, on seeing her son the delighted goddess, the daughter of the mountain gave him the prosperity of the yoga and the Brahmavidya (the esoteric doctrine of Brahman).

After attaining the boon from her, and the perpetual bachelorhood he eulogised Mahadeva with words choked with delight: With palms joined in reverence he bowed down again and again to the lord: He chose boons with eyes devoid of Rajas Guna.

O lord of the chiefs of Devas, bless me with unswerving devotion unto you: O Mahadeva, may I have faith and perpetual nearness to you: On thus being requested by him the smiling lord Saikara offered the brahmin the cherished desire: Thereafter the lord vanished there itself:

# Glory of the Pasupata-Vrata

The sages said

1. This elder brother of Dhaumya was seen by Krsna, son of Vasudeva, of unaffected activities. From him he acquired the divine holy rite of Pasupata.
2. O Suta; how was the knowledge acquired from him by the intelligent Krsna? It behoves you to recount this story that destroys all sins.

Suta said:

Although the eternal lord had incarnated of his own accord as the son of Vasudeva, yet he despised human form and so performed purificatory rites for the body.
For obtaining sons the lord wanted to perform penance: He went to the hermitage of Upamanyu and saw that sage there:
O brahmins, on seeing Upamanyu, the elder brother of Dhaumya, Krsna circumambulated him three times and bowed to him respectfully.
By the mere sight of that intelligent sage all the impurities of Krsna originating from the body as well as physical activities perished.
O leading brahmins, repeating the mantras beginning with Agnih and Vayuh in due order, Upamanyu of great lustre dusted him with Bhasman: With a delighted mind the sage gave him the perfect divine knowledge pertaining to Pasupata: O brahmins, it was due to the favour of the sage that Krsna became initiated honourably in the divine rite of Pasupati: lord Mahesvara.
By means of penance he saw at the end of a year: On seeing the lord accompanied by Ambaore and the Ganas he obtained a son known as Samba who was unbewildered.

10. Ever since then, all the divine segcs of unimpeded holy rites and all the devotees of Pasupati surrounded Krena and stood by him.

11-14. I shall recount another holy rite that bestows perpetual salvation upon all living beings: The devotee shall make a gold girdle, a shaft-receptacle or support; a gold block spherical in shape and a fan with a handle: Then the man or woman shall make an ink-pol and a pen. He shall gather a knife or scissors and a vessel. The devotee shall dust his body with Bhasman and give these articles to the devotee of Pasupati. He shall dedicate a golden, silver or copper vessel in accordance with his capacity. He shall then worship the yogins. All these persons shall be liberated from their sins along with the members of their families. They will go to the divine region of Rudra: No doubt need be entertained in this respect: Hence, by means of charitable gifts

The Sage said:

1. By what is Krena, the lord of the chiefs of all Devas, satisfied? O Suta, it behoves you to mention this as you are conversant with all topics.

Sata said:

2. O leading brahmins, formerly the great sage Markandeya of great splendour was asked by Ambarisa the same question: I shall recount it precisely.

Ambarisa said:

3. O sage Markandeya, you are the master of all virtuous rites: O sage of great intellect, you are an ancient one and an expert in the teachings of the Puranas. What is the most excellent one among the holy divine rites for the devotees of Narayana? Recount it:

4. O highly intelligent sage of good holy rites, what is the most excellent one among the holy divine rites for the devotees of Narayana? Recount it:

5. On hearing his words, Markandeya stood up. With the palms joined in reverence, he remembered lord Narayana, the unchanging Krsna, Acyuta, and said:

Markandeya said:

6-8. O king; listen duly to what I say. The remembrance of Narayana, his worship, the devoted obeisance to him, every one of these holy rites is on par with the horse-sacrifice. Janardana is that excellent Purusa who is the only Being who is said to be a devotee of Siva.

Markandeya is an ancient sage, the reputed author or narrator of the Markandeya Purana, celebrated for his devotion to Vishnu.

is the greatest soul. Brahma and all other beings are born of him: Based on this fact I shall recount the chief Dharma as seen and understood by me:

# 9-12.

Formerly, in the Tretayuga, there was a certain brahmin named Kausika who was perpetually engaged in singing Simans and was devoted to Vasudeva. He thought of him always whilst seated or taking food or lying down on the bed. He frequently sang songs of his noble activities. After reaching the holy centre or the excellent shrine of Vignu he used to sing in praise of Visnu by means of exquisite songs wherein the beating of the time, the intonation and the regulated rise and fall of the sounds contributed to make them sweet: He sang in different tunes pleasing to the ears, in diverse ways. He followed the path of devotion and subsisted solely on alms voluntarily offered by the people:

# 13.

On seeing him singing thus in praise of the lord a certain brahmin Padmaksa, gave him cooked rice:

# 14.

Kausika of great refulgence partook of the rice with the members of his family. In great delight he continued to sing in praise of lord Visnu:

# 15-16.

The brahmin Padmaksa continued to listen to the songs although he went out of the house now and then. After the lapse of some time, seven of the disciples of Kausika came there: They were born of the families of brahmins, kings and vaisyas. They were pure and they excelled one another in wisdom and learning. They were devoted to Vasudeva.

# 17-20.

To them also, Padmaksa served cooked rice: Perpetually accompanied by his disciples, Kausika was delighted in his mind: In a holy centre of Visnu he sang in praise of Visnu and stayed there: There was a certain vaisya Malava. He was devoted to Visnu. With a delighted mind he used to offer him garlands of lights perpetually. His chaste wife Malavi used to scrub the environs of the holy shrine and smear cowdung all round: She used to sit beside her husband listening to the excellent music.

# 21.

For hearing the songs in praise of Visnu fifty excellent brahmins of extolled holy rites came there from Kusasthala: watern promontory: It was the Capital of the country Anarta in the peninsula of V.

22. They were wise and learned. They were conversant with the real meaning of what they learnt; Carrying out the tasks of the noble-souled Kausika, they stayed there listening to his songs.

23. The ability of Kausika to sing sweetly became well known: On hearing about it, the king Kalinga came there and spoke in these words:

24. "So Kausika, accompanied by your attendants in praise of me: O ye people of Kusasthala, you too hear the same."

25-30. On hearing it, Kausika said to the king in an appealing tone: "O great king, neither my tongue nor my words eulogise anyone other than Visnu: They do not speak in praise of even Indra." When this was said, his seven disciples, viz. Vasistha, Gautama, Hari, Sarasvata, Citra, Citramalya and Sisu spoke to the king in the same way as Kausika did. The disciples from Kusasthala who were devoted to Visnu also spoke thus to the king: "So king, these ears of ours do not wish to hear about anyone other than Visnu: We will hear the songs of his praise and never the eulogy of any other."

On hearing this, the king became angry and spoke to his servants: "Sing, ye, so that these brahmins may hear about my renown. When it is being sung about all round how can it be that they do not hear it?"

31-33. The servants who were ordered thus sang excellent songs about the king: Those brahmins whose way was blocked became sad after the songs were over. On realising the inclination of the king; Kausika and other brahmins plugged one another's ears by means of wooden pikes. Saying thus, the brahmins of regular observances cut off the tips of their tongues with their own hands: the infuriated king confiscated their riches.

34-36. Then the king banished them from his kingdom. Thereupon, they went to the north: In due course of time they courted death: On seeing them come, Yama (God of death) was bewildered.

37. Wellarc unto ye all. If you wish to retain your Deva-hood bring those persons here who perpetually worship Vigpu by means of music.

They approached them, seized them and carried them to the world of Brahma by the aerial path: Those Devas reached the world of Brahma within Muhurta:

40. On seeing Kausika and others, Brahma the grandfather of the worlds greeted them. He honoured them by welcoming them: 0 excellent king; seeing what Brahma did Devas became excessively grave: There was great commotion among them:

42-50. Lord Brahma forbade the excellent Devas. He took Kausika and other sages and hurried to the world of Vispu, with great devotion to Vasudeva: Lord Visnu was surrounded by Devas. Lord Narayana, the lord of the Path of knowledge, being served by the splendid Siddhas who resided in the Svetadvipa. They were devotees of Visnu with great mental concentration and purity. They had four divine arms. They were on par with Narayana. They were equipped with the characteristic signs of Visnu: They were brilliant and devoid of sins: He was served by those great people numbering eighty thousand: also by people like us (i.e. Markandeya) and by Narada, Sanaka and other sinless souls. He was also served by different beings all round: Celestial women too served him. He was seated on a Bhadra Pitha (holy seat) in the middle of an aerial chariot that had a thousand doors, that extended to a thousand Yojanas in length. It was divine, bright as well as set with jewels. It was spotlessly.

He came; prostrated and eulogised the garuda-bannered lord. Glancing at him, Visnu; lord Narayana said "O Kausika." With great pleasure he addressed them in due order.

51. There was a great shout of victory when this wonderful event took place: The lord, the sun of the universe, said to Brahma "O Brahma, listen to what is to be mentioned by me.

52. These brahmins who were the residents of Kusasthala endeavoured for the welfare of everyone: They were engaged in achieving what had to be accomplished by Kausika.

53. They are engaged in listening to my glory: They are equipped with the knowledge of reality. They are not devoted to any other deity: May they all become Devas named Sadhyas.

54. Offer them entry to places near me as well as to other auspicious places, for ever."

After saying this, lord Visnu said to Kausika.

55. O brahmin of great intellect, accompanied always by your own disciples; be my attendant. Attain the chieftancy of all my attendants and always remain with me:

56-57. Lord Visnu spoke thus to Malava and Malavi "O Malava, stay as you please in my world, along with your wife as long as this world lasts. Assume divine form: Be glorious lord: Listen to the songs of my praise.

58-59. Lord Visnu said to Padmaksa, "Become the lord and the bestower of riches. Come to me in due course and visit me. Then happily rule over your kingdom:

After saying thus, lord Visnu spoke to Brahma:

60. Thanks to the songs of Kausika, my yogic slumber is over. Accompanied by his disciples he eulogises me in the shrines dedicated to me:

76-82. 0 king; the destroyer of enemies; sage Narada saw Tumburu depart after being duly honoured: On seeing the hospitable reception accorded to Tumburu by Visnu, Narada was overwhelmed with grief affecting his eyes and heart: In the height of his grief he began to worry and ponder over, "By what means will I gain access to Visnu in the presence of the goddess? Alas it has been attained by Tumburu: Fie upon me stupid fellow of confounded mind: I have been driven out of the presence of Visnu by the attendants. Where shall I go? How can I live? Alas a wonderful feat has been achieved by Tumburu." Thinking thus, the brahmin sage performed penance for a thousand years according to divine reckoning. He did not even breathe: Reflecting on the hospitable reception to Tumburu; he meditated on Visnu. He repeatedly cried though he was a scholar and said, "Fie upon me: 0 king, listen to what Visnu did in this regard.

Markandeya said:

1. Thereafter, lord Narayana, the soul of the universe gave everything to Narada and made him equal to Tumburu in due course of time:
2. He made Narada the leading sage like this. This incident happened formerly. The singing of Narayana's songs again and again is an excellent thing:
3. Visnu who is propitiated with songs, grants excellent renown, wisdom, refulgence; satisfaction and abode as it happened to Kausika: excellent Siddhi to Padmakea and

singing, dance, the instrumental music and other festivities. O king, this should be always performed by you along with the persons who are the devotees of Visnu:

6-9. This must always be heard. Visnu should always be praised. The scholar who undertakes songs, dances, narratives and discourses on Visnu in the holy centres of Visnu with devotion acquires the memory of previous births, intellect, awareness at the time of death and identity with Visnu: O leading king, this is true:

O king; what you have asked me has been recounted to you. What more shall I tell you? O most excellent one among the persons who maintain holy rites, tell me.

# Achievement of the Science of Music by Narada

Ambarisa said:

1. O Markandeya of great intellect, by what means did the highly blessed, saintly lord Narada acquire the musical lore?

2. At what time did he attain equality with Tumburu? Tell me all these things: O highly intelligent one, you are omniscient:

Markandeya said:

3. This matter has been heard by me from Narada of divine vision. This Narada of great intellect and of great refulgence mentioned it to me himself:

4-6a. The saintly lord performed penance for a thousand divine years without breathing and recollecting the honour and gravity of Tumburu. He, as the repository of all penances, performed severe penance. Then, Narada the great sage heard in the firmament the divine unembodied wonderful words uttered in a loud voice.

Ulik on the mountain on the northern bank of the Manasa lake: He is known as Ganabandhu, one devoted to music. Go quickly and see him: You will acquire proficiency in music.

Narada, who was the best among the eloquent people, became excessively surprised on being told thus: He approached Ulik on the mountain on the northern bank of the Manasa lake. All around him were seated Gandharvas, Kinnaras, Yakshas, and Apsarases. They were trained by that master and had acquired musical lore. All those who were seated there had exquisite sweetness of tone: They were happy and joyous.

Then glancing at Narada, Ulika said after duly prostrating to him and worshipping him with greetings, "Why, O highly intelligent one, have you come here? O brahmin, what has to be done by me? Tell me what I shall do to you?"

Narada said, leading Ulika of great intellect; "Listen to everything precisely: I shall recount all the antecedents of mine, all the wonderful things that occurred in the past: O scholar, in the previous yuga, Vishnu accompanied by Lakshmi set me aside though I stood near him. Delightfully he invited Tumburu and listened to his excellent song. Brahma and other Devas were banished from their abodes. Kausika and others of unswerving behaviour seated themselves near Vishnu for singing: With their songs they propitiated Vishnu and attained the chief tenancy of the Ganas and they were happy. Due to this, I became dejected: I have come here to perform a penance: What is given by me by way of charity, what is offered by way of Homa, what is heard or learnt by me—all these do not merit even a sixteenth fraction of the path of music associated with the glory of Vishnu: Pondering over this, O brahmin, I performed terrible penance for a thousand divine years for that purpose: Thereafter, O Ulika, I heard an aerial voice pertaining to you, viz: 'O divine sage, if you have any interest in music, go to Ulika. O brahmin, ere long you will know.'

Formerly, there was known as Bhuvanesa: He performed thousand horse-t sacrifices and ten thousand Vajapeyas. That king gifted away millions and crores of cows, gold pieces, clothes, chariots, elephants, horses and virgins to brahmins. He ruled over the earth making people in his kingdom sing in praise of himself and preventing them from singing about others. He proclaimed thus: “If anyone sings in praise of Vienu or anyone else, he will be killed by me: The great Being is worthy of being worshipped by the Vedas: May women sing about me, perpetually and everywhere: May the bards sing only about me:

# 29-33.

Having ordered thus, the king of great refulgence ruled over the kingdom: Very near the capital of that king there was a brahmin known as Harimitra: He was a devotee of Vienu and was devoid of all Dvandvas (mutually clashing opposites:) He used to frequent the banks of rivers and worship the idol of Vispu: He offered sweet rice cooked in milk, sweet pies, etc. to Vignu with ghee and curds in plenty: After duly bowing down with his mind dedicated to Vienu he sang in praise of him with exquisite beating of time and due intonation: He was endowed with excess of devotion and his innermost mind dwelt on Vispu: Once upon a time, spies came there at the behest of the king:

# 34.

They spoiled his activities of worship all round. The king arrested the brahmin and informed the duly.

# 35.

Then the wicked king rebuked the excellent brahmin, confiscated his riches, and exiled him from his kingdom.

The Mlecchas seized the idol of Vignu and went mleccha. The term mleccha bearing on the date of the Purana.

mitra who was proceeding ahead on an aerial chariot sparkling like the sun, surrounded by the immortal beings: I attained excellent longevity by the grace of Indradyumna: It was due to him, O sage of good holy rites, that I could see Harimitra. Thanks to the power of his prowess, my mind turned towards music. O sage, I sat among the Kinnaras for sixty thousand years practicing the art of music. My tongue was blessed and it was rendered clear: Then, I learnt music: Within twice that period I attained perfection in the art. By that time ten manvantaras had elapsed. I became preceptor of music. Gandharvas and others came there: Kinnaras approached me as their preceptor: O sage of great penance; musical lore cannot be acquired by means of penance:

57-63. Hence; you shall acquire music from me along with proper hearing of the notes. The sage who was advised thus bowed down to Uluka and sang: Hear that, O excellent sage, and bow down to Vasudeva.

Mirkandeya said:

On being urged thus by Uluka, the sage Narada learned the art of music in accordance with the procedure of learning: At that time, Uluka said "Be devoid of shyness now."

Ulaka said:

One shall eschew all shyness during sexual intercourse, while singing, when playing the game of dice, while conducting discourse in an assembly, when carrying out business transactions, while taking food, when hoarding wealth, and in calculating income and expenses:

One should never sing with bent body, nor while shrouded under blankets, etc: While singing, undue manual gestures should be eschewed, mouth should not be opened too wide nor should the tongue be stretched out. One should not sing with the hands lifted up or with the eyes turned upwards. While singing, one should not survey one's own body nor stare at another man.

It is not proper to clap at the buttocks while rising nor should there be laughter, anger and shaking of limbs. Memory shall not be diverted elsewhere:

81-83. I shall make you equal to Tumburu, nay even excelling him: Till then learn and teach this art among Devas and Gandharvas. After saying this, Vienu vanished there itself: Thereafter, the celestial sage of divine refulgence became devoted to Vasudeva. Bedecked in ornaments Narada the store-house of austerities became engrossed in playing on his lute:

84-85. With his lute resting on his shoulders, the righteous sage wandered over all the worlds, viz. the worlds of Varuna, Yama, Agni, Indra, Kubera, Vayu and Isa. The sage who was proficient in playing on lute sang in praise of Vienu after going to the assemblies of these guardians of quarters:

86-88. Here and there; he was duly worshipped by the Gandharvas and Apsarases: Once upon a time, he went to the world of Brahma. There were two Gandharvas Haha and Huhu: They were adepts in the art of vocal and instrumental music: The divine Gandharvas were the bards of Brahma: In their company, the excellent sage of great refulgence sang in praise of Lord Vigpu. He was duly honored by Brahma.

Achievement of the Science of Music

89. After bowing down to Brahma, the grandfather of the worlds, Nareda wondered over the worlds, as he pleased.

90. After the lapse of a great deal of time, the sage went to the abode of Tumburu taking his lute with him. Seated there, he began to sing:

91. On seeing the seven notable notes, Sadja etc. stationed there, the saintly lord went out hurriedly:

92. The sage of great intellect learned and taught this science in different places. The great sage became exhausted thereby. Though he was an expert in the science of music, he sat staring at the presiding goddesses of the seven notes. But they did not descend upon the lute-strings while he played on them.

93-94. Thereafter, on the mountain Raivatakal, the great sage bowed down to Krishna and told him about what Narayana in Svetadvipa had told him formerly in respect to hearing this, Krapa, the excellence in the art of music. On hearing this, he spoke to Jambavati smilingly and joyously:

96-98. "O gentle lady, teach this excellent sage the art of playing on the lute in accordance with the Sastraic injunctions." Saying to Vishnu laughingly, "As you say," she taught the sage Narada. When a year was completed, he approached Vishnu once again, bowed down to him, and stood in front of him. Vishnu then said, "Go near Satya (Satyabhama) and acquire due training:" saying thus, the sage bowed down.

99-102. "As you say" to Satyabhama and began to sing: The scholarly sage was trained by her. When a year was completed, the sage went to the abode of Rukmini, on being directed by Vishnu. The excellent sage was addressed thus by the maid-servants and other ladies: "Although you have been singing for a long time, you do not understand the notes properly."

Then, with very great effort the sage was trained by the gentle lady Rukmini for a period of three years: The sage then sang when the presiding ladies of Svaras attained harmonious blend with the string.

# 103.

Then; Lord Krepa, the incomprehensible soul, himself called the great sage and taught him the excellent art of music.

# 104.

Thereby the excellent sage surpassed Tumburu: The celestial sage thereupon danced in joy after duly bowing down to Vispu:

# 105.

Vispu laughed and said: "O great sage, you now know everything: With due and perfect knowledge sing in my presence: What you have been seeking

has been attained by you: Hence, sing in praise of me along with the sage Tumburu:

# 107-109.

Thus urged, Narada acted accordingly: When Krishna worshiped Rudra the leader of the worlds, the sage sang in praise of Siva at the behest of Visnu: He sang in the company of Rukmini, Satya and Jambavati as well as Krishna. O excellent king; he had become by this time an expert in the seven primary notes.

Leading sages, thus the gradual acquisition of the art of music by the sage Narada has been mentioned to you:

# 10-12.

O king, a brahmin who sings the glory of Vasudeva befittingly attains the world of Vaikuntha. One who sings in praise of Rudra will be more excellent: Otherwise, one will fall into the hell. A person singing in praise of anyone else will also fall into the hell:

One who is devoted to Vishnu mentally, verbally and physically, one who sings about him and one who hears his glory shall attain him. Hence, they know that he is the greatest lord.

# CHAPTER FOUR

The description of the devotees of Vishnu

The sages said:

1. O highly intelligent one, tell us, what are the characteristics of those persons who are devoted to Vasudeva and who are called Vaishnavas, devotees of Vishnu?
2. O Suta, the most excellent one among those who know all topics, recount all this to us. What does the lord, the conceiver and Creator of living beings, do unto them?

Suta said:

Formerly, the sage Markandeya was asked by Ambarisha the same topic as has been mentioned by you now. I shall precisely recount the same to you:

Markandeya said:

O king, listen: What you ask me is pertinent: Narayana is present there where the devotee of Vishnu stays.
Vishnu is remembered as their deity everywhere: When he is being eulogized, a Vaishnava invariably feels an emotional thrill: He who is delighted on seeing persons endowed with devotion to Vishnu, and those who perform rites laid down in Srutis and Smritis, is eulogized as a Vaishnava. On seeing them, his body shivers and perspires; drops of tears are seen in his eyes.
A Vaishnava does not wear more clothes than what are needed for his body's protection.
On seeing a devotee of Vishnu coming, he stands face to face, performs obeisance towards Vasudeva himself.
He should be known as the devotee; he will be victorious in the three worlds who speaks with forbearance even on hearing harsh words. He who puts on scents, fragrant flowers, etc., on his head thinking that everything belongs to Vishnu is known as Vaishnava.
Endowed with auspicious rites in the body centre of Vishnu, he shall worship the idol of Vishnu perpetually with a purified soul. He shall then be known as a devotee of Vishnu: Mentally, verbally and...

physically he is devoted to Narayana for ever: Indeed, he is a great Bhagavata devotee of the lord:

13b-14a. He who offers food and duly propitiates another devotee of Vishnu in accordance with his ability, is really Vaishnava. Vishnu accepts the food from anyone with a delighted mind, that food is undoubtedly one that goes into the mouth of Vishnu: Vishnu the soul of the Universe, the favourite of his devotees, becomes more pleased than from his own worship, when he sees the game being done to his devotee:

14b-16a. On seeing a Vaishnava who is devoted to Vishnu and who has burned all his sins, even Devas become afraid. They bow down to him before proceeding on their own ways. Listen to an ancient anecdote that demonstrates the prowess of a devotee of Vishnu. On seeing the son of Bhrgu who was a devotee and Vaishnava who had buried his sins, Yama stood up with palms joined in reverence and bowed to him. Hence, a man shall devoutly worship Vaishnavas in the same manner as they worship Vishnu. He undoubtedly attains nearness to Vishnu: devotee of Vishnu surpasses thousands of other devotees: devotee of Rudra is far better than thousands of other devotees of Vishnu: There is certainly no one greater than the devotee of Rudra in this world: Hence, by all means one shall worship Vaishnava or devotee of Rudra for achieving virtue, love; wealth and salvation.

It is well known in the world that the discus of Visnu perpetually warded off fear from enemies and ailment of that great soul of righteous conduct: O excellent one; recount the story of Ambarisa wholly: O Suta, we wish to know precisely his greatness, majestic dignity and excellent devotion: It behoves you to narrate it:

Suta said

5. O leading sages, may the story of the intelligent Ambarisa be heard: The glory of Ambarisa is extremely destructive of all sins:

6. The beloved wife of Trisanku; the mother of Ambarisa was resplendent with all characteristic attributes. She was perpetually endowed with purity:

7-13a. Her name was Padmavati. She worshipped Narayana, the great Atman who was in his yogic slumber, who lay on the couch of Sesa, who was the source of origin of the lotus of the Cosmic Egg, who is called Kalarudra in view of his tamas quality, who is Kanakandaja (i.e: born of the golden Eggie Brahma) in view of his rajas quality and who is Visnu the omnipresent lord bowed to by all Devas in his Sattva quality. She worshipped the lord for ever mentally, physically and verbally: She wreathed the garland herself and offered them to the lord. She ground the scents; etc. into paste; offered incense and other articles; scrubbed and smeared the ground and cooked Havis all by herself: She was zealous and eager in doing all these things. The chaste lady continuously uttered the names Narayana, Ananta, etc. With her innermost conscience devoted to him the pure queen worshipped Visnu for ten thousand years with scents, flowers; etc.

13b-15. She always propitiated highly blessed devotees of Visnu, devoid of all sins, by giving charitable gifts, and honoring them with riches and jewels. Once that blessed lady had concluded her fast on the DvadaSi day and was lying asleep in

front of lord Vigu along with her husband. Then lord Nira-

yana, Purusottama spoke to her:

# 16-17.

O gentle lady, O lustrous lady, tell me: What boon do you wish from me? On seeing the lord thus generous she said, "May my son be Vaisnava. May he be an Emperor of great refulgence, pure and engrossed in his duties."

Visnu said, "So be it," and gave her a fruit;

# 18.

On waking up she saw the fruit and mentioned everything to her husband: In great delight and with her mind directed towards the lord she ate the fruit:

# 19-20.

Then, in due course of time, she gave birth to a son destined to make the family flourish: He was devoted to Vasudeva. He maintained good conduct: He was richly endowed with auspicious characteristics, and had curly hairs that resembled small wheels. On seeing the son born the father performed all holy rites:

# 21-22.

The lord became well known in the world as Ambarisa. The glorious lord was crowned king when his father passed away. He entrusted the kingdom to the care of his ministers and became a sage. He performed a severe penance repeating the names of lord Narayana for a thousand years:

# 23-27a.

He meditated on lord Purusottama as follows: He is stationed in the middle of the lotus of the cavity of his heart, coming there from the middle of the solar sphere: He has four arms holding the conch, discus, iron club and the lotus. He is as resplendent as pure gold. He is identical with Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The lord is endowed with all ornaments and wears yellow robes. The lord has the scar Srivatsa on his chest. Thereupon, lord Visnu, the sun of the universe, culogised by all Devas, bowed to by the worlds, made Garuda resemble Airavata of unimaginable splendour and rode on it. He came to the place of penance seated on it in the guise of Indra: He then spoke thus to the excellent king:

# 27b-30.

"Welfare unto you. I am Indra. What boon shall I grant you? I am the lord of all the worlds: I have come down to help you:

Ambarisa said: I have not meditated upon you while performing penance: Nor do I wish for anything given by You: O Indra, you will

Thereupon, Lord Visnu laughed and resumed his own form.

# 31-32

Visnu the sun of everyone shone like another blue mountain, on Guruda. He had the sword, the bow Sarnga, the iron club and the discus in his arms. He was eulogised by Devas and Gandharvas all round: The delighted king bowed to and eulogised the Guruda-bannered lord:

# 33-38

O lord, O lord of the worlds, O my lord; be pleased: O Krsna, O Visnu, O lord of the Universe, bowed to by the worlds, you are the primordial lord; you have no beginning: You are the eternal Purusa; you are lord Visnu the incomprehensible lord. You are Govinda, the lotus-eyed lord. You are born of the body of Mahesvara: A lotus is grown up from your umbilicus. You sojourn the skies: You stride over the firmament; you are the Kapalin carrying the kavya offerings. You are the wind-god conveying the havya offerings. You are the primordial lord delighted in holy rites. You are the great Atman stationed within the Atman: O Govinda, I have resorted to you: son of Devaki, be victorious. O lord, be victorious, lord of the Universe, O lotus-eyed one, save me: I have no other goal but you. You alone are my refuge:

Suta said:

Lord Visnu then spoke to him: "O king of good holy rites what is it that you have resolved to do? I shall give you everything: You are my devotee: I am always fond of devotion. Hence; I have come here to give you whatever you seek."

Ambarisa said:

# The Anecdote of Srimatt

54. On seeing the two sages come, Ambarisa of great refulgence bowed down and worshipped them:

55-56. On seeing that girl playing about like the lightning streak amidst clouds, the saintly lord Narada smilingly asked, "O king; who is this highly blessed girl comparable to the daughters of Devas? She is resplendent with auspicious signs. Tell me, O king, the most excellent one among virtuous persons."

The king said:

57. "O lord, this is my daughter Srimati. The splendid girl has attained the age when she should be given in marriage: I am in search of a bridegroom."

58. On being told thus, O brahmins, the leading sage Narada desired her. O excellent sages, the sage Parvata too loved her.

59. Narada the righteous soul called the king secretly and said, "Give your daughter unto me."

60-64. The saintly lord Parvata too made the same request: Thereupon, the righteous king was frightened. He bowed down to both of them and said, "O Sirs, both of you woo my daughter. How can I do this? O Narada of great intellect, O saintly lord Parvata, listen to what I say: If this splendid daughter of mine chooses one of you, I shall give him my daughter: Otherwise, I am helpless." After saying "So be it," they said, "We shall come again tomorrow." The leading sages, who were devoted to Vishnu and who were the wisest of the wise, went away delighted in their minds.

65. After going to the world of Vishnu, Narada the most excellent among sages bowed down to Vishnu and said:

66. "O lord, hear me. I shall tell you in secret: O lord of the worlds, obeisance to you:

67. Then lord Vishnu, the soul of the universe, smilingly said to the sage, "Say." The sage then said to him:

of great austeritie. He too desircs hcr, 0 lord, thc king Ambarisa of grcat refulgence said thus to us: "If this girl chooses one of you, endowed with handsome features I shall give her unto him."

As the king said thus I too said (So be it: 0 king, I will come to your abode tomorrow morning): So saying I came away: 0 lord of the universe, I have come to you and it behoves you to do what is pleasing to me:

73. O lord of the Universe; if you wish to do what is pleasing to me kindly manage it in such a way as to make Parvata's face appear like that of a monkey:

74. So be it said Vispu the slayer of Madhu, smilingly: "0 gentle one, I shall do what is desired by you: Go back now."

75. When he was assured thus, the delighted sage bowed to Vispu. Considering himself blessed he went to Ayodhya:

76. When that excellent sage had gone Parvata the great sage was delighted. He bowed down to Vignu and told him secretly. After submitting his mission he said: "0 lord of the universe, please make the face of Narada appear like that of the dark-coloured monkey Golangula:

78-80. On bearing that; lord Vispu said: "I shall do what is desired by you: Hurry down to Ayodhya. Let not Narada know my understanding with you:" Saying "Let it be so," he too went away.

On knowing that the two excellent sages had come; the king decorated Ayodhya with flags and festoons. He embellished it with flowers and fried grains scattered about.

81. The portals of the houses were sprinkled with water: The bazaars and the highways were watered well: The city was fumigated with fragrant essences:

cushioned scats with exquisite coverings Were placed all round:

84. After making these arrangements the leading king took the girl with him and entered the hall. She was richly bedecked in all ornaments. She appeared like Sri with her large beautiful eyes: slender that it could be measured with a single hand: She was smooth and glossy in five of her limbs. Her face was remarkably splendid: Divinely resplendent like that Srimati came into the hall surrounded by ladies.

86. The assembly hall of the king was richly elegant with choicest jewels and excellent gems of diverse kinds. The seats were arranged decently. Garlands and festoons were neatly tied. The elite of the society entered it and shone brilliantly:

87. The noble son of Brahma, the saintly lord of great soul, the most excellent among the knowers of Brahman, the great sage Narada well-versed in the threefold lore came there accompanied by Parvata.

88. On seeing that they had come, the king was in a great flutter of the mind. Offering them illustrious seats he worshipped both.

89. Both of them were great Siddhas and celestial sages. Both of them were excellent among those who were endowed with perfect knowledge: The noble souls, the excellent sages seated themselves and waited for the girl.

90. At the outset the king bowed down to both and then he addressed his splendid daughter, the renowned lady with eyes resembling the petals of a lotus.

91. O gentle lady, offer this garland to one of these two after bowing down to him duly, whosoever it may be, whom you mentally choose as your bridegroom:

92-96a. On being urged thus, the splendid-eyed bride took up the divine golden garland in her arms. Surrounded by the ladies in attendance she came to the place where those noble sages were sitting: On glancing at the excellent sages, Parvata and Narada she saw that they had the faces of monkeys. Seeing the face of Golangula monkey the girl was a bit frightened and excited in her mind: She stood trembling like a plantain tree in a storm. The king then said to her, "O dear one, rance-mnigdham delicate in five limbs:

The frightened girl said to her father, "These two are human apes. I do not see the excellent sage, either Narada or Parvata: But in between them I see a handsome young man less than sixteen years in age: He is richly bedecked in all ornaments: He resembles the Atasito flower: He is elegant with long arms, large eyes and moon-like lustre. His hips and neck are marked with lines: His eyes are large and reddish: He shines brilliantly with two remarkable eyebrows that by and large resemble a bent bow. Clear-cut threefold curly hairs are manifest in his umbilical region. The belly is splendidly manifest: He is clad in gold-coloured robes: His nails are raised up and resemble gems. The hands are shaped like lotuses: His face and eyes resemble lotuses: His nose is splendid. He is lotus-hearted and lotus-navelled: He is perfectly enveloped in glorious splendour: Looking at me he is smiling broadly with the rows of teeth resembling the buds of Kunda flowers: He is standing stretching his right hand towards me: The hairs on his head are splendid. It is him that I see: The king then spoke to her as she stood there trembling like the tender stem of the plantain tree with her mind all in flutter, "O dear one, what are you going to do?"

When this was spoken, sage Narada who began to doubt, asked, "O girl, how many hands has he? Tell me precisely."

# 105-140

The bride with pure smiles said, "I see a pair of arms."

Parvata then asked her, "O splendid lady, what do you see on his chest? Tell me: What do you see in his hands?"

The bride then spoke to him, "I see a garland exquisite in its five-fold forms on his chest. In his hand I see the bow and the arrows: thus, the excellent sages looked at each other: They replied to one another: They thought thus in their minds. {This is a deception of someone: The wielder of Maya and the culprit is Vigau himself: How can a newcomer make our face like this in the...}

manner of that of a Golangula monkey ?" So thought Nirada: Parvata too began to worry thus mentally: "How is it that I have attained the form of a monkey?"

# 11-116.

Then the king bowed down to Narada and Parvata and said, "What is this intellectual confusion that has been brought about by both of you? Both of you, please be quiet as befitting those who seek the hand of a bride:"

On being told thus, the excellent sage spoke furiously to the king, "It is you who cause this delusion, not we, by any means. Let this girl choose one of us. Let there be no delay."

Thereupon the young lady again bowed down to her favorite deity: On looking up she saw, before, the handsome young man standing between them honourably attentive: He was bedecked in all ornaments and resembled the Atasi flower. His hands were long; his limbs supple and well-developed, his eyes extended as far as his ears. On seeing him she offered the garland unto him: Thereafter, the girl was never again seen by anybody: (What is this?" said everyone.

# 17-119.

A tumult arose in surprise: Vishnu has taken her away to his abode: This excellent lady Srimati was born as a result of penances performed formerly for attaining him. She has now gone to Vigou.

The two leading sages who had thus been hoodwinked became extremely dejected. They hastened to the abode of Vishnu: On seeing that they had come, lord Vishnu said to Srimati: "The excellent sages have come: Hide yourself here:"

Saying "So be it," the lady smilingly did.

Narada bowed down in front of Vishnu and said to him: "Indeed you have done what is pleasing to me and Parvata. Certainly, O Vishnu, it is you who have abducted the bride:

With your intellect you have deluded us and cheated us, O excellent lord: On being told thus, lord Vishnu closed his ears with his hands and said: "What is this being uttered by you two? Oh! is this emotion of love a course of conduct for sages?"

On being told thus, the sage Narada replied, whispering into his ear: "How is it that my face resembled that of a Golangula monkey?" The lord whispered back into his ear, "O learned one, I have turned Parvata too into a monkey. It is for your own pleasure that your face was made to resemble that of a Golangula and not otherwise."

127. Parvata two spoke similarly and the lord replied to him in the same manner. Then Visnu spoke within the hearing of both.

128-135. "I have done what is pleasing to you both: I can truthfully say," Narada, the righteous soul then said, "A person armed with a bow stood between us: Who was it? Did not he abduct her?" On hearing it, Visnu spoke to the excellent sages, "There are many excellent noble men wielding Maya. I am always armed with my discus. I remain forever with my four arms, O excellent sages, to be sure not having seen Srimati there, I have not desired her. Indeed, this is known to you both." On being told thus, the sages became mentally delighted. They bowed down to the lord and said, "O lord of the universe, what is your fault in this matter? It is the wickedness of that king alone: He has wielded Maya."

Having said this, Narada and Parvata left that place and went to Ambarisa and cursed him. Narada and Parvata said, "Wherefore have we come here? After inviting us, why have you given your daughter to another person? Why had you recourse to deception? Hence, darkness, sorrow will attack you."

136-137. For the same reason you will not know your own self precisely.

When the curse was uttered thus, a mass of darkness rose up. Thereupon, the discus of Visnu appeared instantly on behalf of the king. Frightened of the discus, the terrible darkness rushed against the two sages.

138-144. Thereupon, the frightened great sages began to run with fear creeping up all their limbs. On seeing the discus and the inaccessibly terrible tamas closely behind them, they hastened their steps saying, "Alas! We have acquired the bride."

# The anecdote of Srimati

Distressed in their fright they ran as far as the Lokalokaj mountain. They shouted in their excess of fear, "Save us, Save us" to Visnu: They went to the world of Visnu and said: "O Narayana, O lord of the universe, O Vasudeva, O Hrsi-kesa, O Padmanabha, O Janardana, save us, O lotus-eyed one: O Purusottama, you are our lord: Thereupon, the glorious lord Narayana who cannot be properly thought of, the lord with the mark of Srivatsa scar, stopped the discus as well as the Darkness with the desire to bless his devotees.

Ambarisa is my devotee: So also are these excellent sages: I must do what is wholesome and beneficial to him as well as to them both now. The excellent lord, the glorious lord Visnu called them. Delighting them with his words, lord Visnu said, "Both of you listen to these words of mine:

145-149 The curse of the sages shall not be otherwise. Nor should the boon granted by me to the king for his protection. A glorious and virtuous king Dasaratha will be born as the famous son of the great-grandson of the son of Ambarisa. I will be born as his eldest son Rama: There my right hand will be Bharata: Satrughna will be my left hand. This Sesa will be born as Laksmana. There you come to me: Now you leave the king alone: you leave off the excellent sages also," so said Visnu.

Tamas (darkness) who was addressed thus was destroyed instantaneously. 150-152 The discus that was warded off remained as before: The two excellent sages who were rid of their fear bowed down to Visnu and came out with great dejection. They said to each other, "From now onwards till our death we shall never woo a girl." After taking this vow the sages became purely devoted to Yoga and meditation. They remained celibates forever:

In order to know Ambarisa and the two leading the Rama became an Isvara unaware of his own Atman after being born as the son of Dasaratha: Looking at Vishnu, the excellent sages Bhrgu and others said: "Maya should not be practised against scholars: After a long time, Narada and Parvata realised the activity of Vishnu and became devotees of Rudra: Thus, everything has been mentioned to you, Viz. the greatness of Ambarisa as well as the deceptive practice of Maya of Vishnu. The man who reads, listens or narrates this tale shall eschew Maya and attain the world of Rudra: This is holy and highly sacred: It has been recounted by the Vedas.

Sutta said: In order to delude the universe, the glorious lord Vishnu who has neither beginning nor end and who is the lord of the universe, created this twofold aspect in the universe: Vishnu created one set consisting of brahmins, Vedas, Vedic virtues and Padma-Sri. The lord of great refulgence made another set consisting of Jyestha, Alakshmi, the base men excluded from the Vedic sphere as well as sin: It was after creating Alakshmi at the outset that Vishnu created Padma afterwards.

A brahminical sage Duhsaha married the inauspicious Jyestha after seeing her fully stabilised mentally. Accompanied by her the delighted sage wandered all round the world: O brahmins, wherever there was loud chanting sound of the names of Vispu and Siva the great Atman, wherever there was loud sound of the Vedic mantras, wherever these was the column of smoke rising from sacrifices and wherever there were people with their limbs smeared with Bhasman, the deity of misfortune was extremely frightened. She used to close her ears and run about here and there: On seeing Jyestha behaving thus, sage Duhsaha became confused and bewildered: Accompanied by her he went to the forest: In the terrible forest he performed a great penance. Saying "I will not perform the penance" the girl Jyestha roamed about from house to house: The pious sage, the leading yogin, devoted to the practice of yoga and perfect wisdom saw the noble Markandeya coming there; Bowing down to the great sage, Duhsaha said

# 15-18.

O saintly lord this wife of mine will not stand me by any means. O brahminical sage, what shall I do with this wife? Where shall I enter and where shall I not enter? Markandeya said:

O Duhsaha listen; this inauspicious lady is called everywhere thus: Akirti (Ill-repute), Alaksmi (misfortune), Atula (unbalanced, incomparable) and Jyestha (the eldest). By no means enter those places where noble souls, devoted to Visnu, following the Vedic path, as well as the devotees of Rudra who have dusted and smeared their bodies with Bhasman are present always.

It is only the wicked who do not say that Brahma, Visnu and Indra the ruler of Devas are all born by the grace of Rudra.

The Origin and activities of Alaksmi
76. In the company of his wife the leading sage went particularly to the abodes of those engaged in despising Visnu, the lord of Devas: This is the deity remembered as Jyestha.

77-78. Once Duhsaha said to her thus: "You stay here in this hermitage on the banks of the lake: I will be entering the Nether worlds. After finding out a spot for our residence I will return to you again." On being told thus, she said:

79-81. "O blessed one; what shall I eat? Who will give oblation unto me?" On being asked thus the sage said, "Do not enter the houses of those women who worship you with oblations, flowers and incense." After saying this, he entered the nether worlds through a crevasse. Even now the sage remains submerged under the watery bed: The deity of inauspiciousness remains outside villages and mountains perpetually:

82. Casually, Visnu, the lord of the chiefs of Devas, the overlord of the three worlds, was seen by her along with Lakshmi. Alaksmi said to Janardana:

83. "O lord of long brawny arms, my husband has gone unto the crevasse after abandoning me: O lord of the universe, I am devoid of leader and support: Give unto me the means of sustenance. Obeisance be to thee."

84. Lord Visnu, the lord of Devas, the husband of Lakshmi, the slayer of Madhu; laughed and said to her:

85-87. "Yours indeed is the wealth of those persons who censure Rudra the sinless deity, Sarva, Nilalohita, Satkara; Amba the daughter of the Himavan, the mother of all the worlds and my devotees. Even if my devotees censure Mahadeva and worship me they are stupid and unfortunate: Their wealth belongs to you. It is at his behest and due to his grace that Brahma and I exist:

Sata said

After saying thus, Vignu left Alakemi and went away with Laksmi: Lord Vignu then performed the Japa of Rudra mantra for the sake of realizing the destruction of Alaksmi:

Hence; O leading sage, Perpetual oblation shall definitely be offered to her by the devotees of Visnu by all means. O brahmins, she should always be worshipped by women by means of oblations of different kinds. This narrative he who reads, listens to or recounts of Alaksmi to excellent brahmins, will become sinless and fortunate: He is sure to attain salvation.

Brahman %8 He who is a scholar, he who performs meritorious deeds shall always repeat the names of Narayana after making obeisance to him mentally, verbally and physically. One shall remember lord Visnu while sleeping, walking, taking food, standing, keeping awake, opening or closing the eyes: O brahmins, he shall remember the eternal lord repeating the words Namo Narayanaya (Obeisance to Narayana). He who inspires edibles, beverages and lambatives by reciting the mantra (Namo Narayanaya) touches it and then partakes of it, attains the greatest salvation.

9-14. Hegctsrid of all sins and attains the goal of the good. The deity who is mentioned by me as Alaksmi, the wife of Duhsaha, undoubtedly departs, on hearing the word "Narayana." O sages of good holy rites, Laksmi, who is the beloved wife of Visnu, Krsna the lord of Devas, resides in his body, house, abode and field. After looking up all the sacred texts, after pondering over them again and again this is the outcome that Narayana should always be meditated upon: Of what avail are the multifarious mantras unto him, of what avail are the numerous holy rites unto him? The mantra "Namo Narayanaya" (obeisance to Narayana) is the means for achieving all objects: Hence, one shall repeat the mantra 'Namo Narayanaya' on all occasions. O leading brahmins, he goes to the world of Viqqu along with his kinsmen: excellent sages, listen to another mantra of the lord of Devas.

15-16a. This mantra had been learned and practised by me formerly: It is the means of achieving the essence of the Vedas: It is an ancient one consisting of twelve syllables and twelve forms. I shall tell you, in brief the greatness of the same - was a certain brahmin of great

But Aitarcya (the son of the brahmin) invariably uttered the name "Vasudeva." His father married another lady duly and procreated many sons who learned the Vedas and became richly endowed with learning. They were honoured by everyone:

Aitareya's mother became excessively sad and dejected. She said, "Richly accomplished sons who have mastered the Vedas and ancillary subjects and who are honoured and worshipped by brahmins delight their mother. But you, shapeless son, are born to me, a woman devoid of good luck: My death would have been far better." On being told thus, he (Aitareya) went out to the sacrificial hall:

# 24.

When he entered there, the mantras did not come out from the mouth of the brahmins. As long as Aitareya stayed there, the brahmins continued to be deluded:

# 25-27.

But when Aitareya uttered "Vasudeva," their voices came out. Those brahmins bowed down and worshipped Aitareya. Then they continued the yajna, and Aitareya concluded it by means of wealth and other things. In the end, with great concentration, he repeated the Vedas along with their ancillaries in the Vidatha Assembly of priests. O brahmins, Brahma and other brahmins eulogised him.

# 28-33.

Siddhas and Caranas moving about in the firmament showered flowers. O excellent brahmins, after concluding the yajna thus, Aitareya worshipped his mother and went to the abode of Vishnu. Thus, the greatness of the twelve-syllabled mantra has been recounted wholly: It destroys the great sins of those who read and listen to this.

1. 0 excellent brahmins, the eight-syllabled mantra viz. "Om namo Narayanaya" and the twelve-syllabled mantra, viz. "Om namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya" are the greatest mantras of the great Atman. 0 brahmins, the six-syllabled mantra, viz. "Om namah Sivaya" connotes the entire meaning of all the Vedic passages. This mantra is the means of achieving all objects. The divine five-syllabled mantra "Sivatariya" is very auspicious. So also is the mantra "smayaskaraya" [(obeisance) to one who brings about excellence]. The mantra of seven syllables, viz. "Namaste Sankaraya" is the mantra of Rudra, the Purusa (in conjunction with Pradhana. 0 excellent brahmins, Brahma, lord Visnu; Devas including Indra and the sages worship Sankara, the lord of the chiefs of Devas with these mantras. They worship Siva, the source of origin of Brahma, and the consort of Uma, the lord of Devas (with these mantras). They say continuously namah Sivaya; namaste Sankaraya, mayaskaraya, Rudraya and Sivataraya: By repeating these (mantras) the brahmin is instantaneously liberated from the sins of brahmin-slaughter, etc.

There was a certain powerful brahmin Dhundhumika: That kalpa is called Meghavahana because Visnu the lord of Devas assumed the form of a cloud and performed penance in propitiation of Mahadeva, the hide-clad lord, Rudra. Thanks to his high reverence for Rudra, he performed penance leaving off the intake and expiration of even breath: He was overwhelmed and dejected due to too much of burden: He submitted his problem to the blue-necked lord. The lotus-eyed lord performed penance and as a result acquired wonderful strength from Sankara the great Itman.

13-14. In that Meghavahana kalpa, due to the curse of a sage the son of Dhundhumika became wicked. Formerly, Dhundhumika had been deluded by his wife: He was too much attracted by her. A foetus was procreated by him in her with his mind drawn by lust: It was on the Amavasya day, during the Rudra muhurta that his pregnant wife was enjoyed by him.

15. Her name was Visalya. With great strain, she gave birth to a son, O excellent sages, in Rudra muhurta aspected by Saturn. He became an unlucky omen unto his father and mother as well as unto himself. The excellent sages Mitra and Varuna, O brahmins, said to Dhundhumika in secret that he was a wicked son. Vasistha said, "Although he is base and wicked, this son of yours will be liberated from sins by the prowess of Brhaspati (Jupiter): O excellent brahmins, Dhundhumika became dejected on seeing the son in such a plight: He himself performed the postnatal and other rites for him.

21. Thereafter, he taught him the Vedas. Everything was perfectly learnt by the son of Dhundhumika. His marriage was performed and he became interested in serving his father.

22-23. O excellent sages, in the height of his arrogance this son of Dhundhumika sought a Sudra woman and enjoyed her like his wife by day and by night sitting with her in the same.

24-30. Wine was drunk by him along with her for the excitement of his lust: But, O excellent brahmins, for some vague reason that inauspicious Sudra woman was killed by that sinner. Thereupon his father, mother, and the legal wife of the wicked son of Dhundhumuka were killed by her brothers. O sages of good holy rites, those brothers-in-law were also killed by the king: Thus her and his families were destroyed in an instant. The son of Dhundhumuka went here and there in the course of his sporting activities. Somehow, he saw an excellent sage engaged in repeating Rudra's names: At the outset, he obtained the Pasupata mantra of lord Mahesvara. After attaining the five-syllabled mantra and the six-syllabled mantra he repeated them a hundred thousand times severally. He performed the divine holy rite in accordance with the injunctions for a period of twelve months: In the course of that kalpa, he passed away and was welcomed by Yama.

31-36. O sages of good holy rites, his mother, father, brother-in-law, and the fortunate wife were redeemed. The chaste lady remained smiling: Along with them he got into an aerial chariot: He was eulogised by Devas including Indra: He attained the chieftaincy of the Ganas and became a favourite of Rudra: Hence, merit is increased ten million times due to the eight-syllabled and twelve-syllabled mantras. No doubt need be entertained in this respect: Hence, he who continuously repeats these mantras in accordance with the injunctions laid down before and in combination with the mantra of Sakti attains the greatest goal. This excellent story has thus been entirely mentioned to you: He who reads, listens, or recounts it to excellent brahmins goes to the world of Brahma.

# The Holy Rite of Pasupata

Suta said:

1. O Suta, the divine and auspicious holy rite of Pasupati had been performed formerly by Devas. It had been performed by Brahma himself and by Krsna of unimpaired activity. Similarly, it was performed by the fallen brahmin, the son of Dhundhumuka: How could they attain salvation after performing the Pasupata rite? How is lord Pasupati propitiated? It behoves you to recount this to us. We are very much eager to hear it.

Suta said:

4. Formerly, the son of Brahma of great renown was liberated from the curse of Rudra the lord of Devas: He came here from the Desert-land. Eschewing the physical body of camele at the bidding of Brahma and by the grace of Rudra, O excellent sages, he went to Nandin the son of Silada and bowed to him in accordance with the injunctions. On the ridge of Meru, the excellent sage listened to the discourse on the excellent virtue: After bowing to Nandin, he again and again asked him about the holy rite pertaining to Mahesvara. How is lord Pasupati propitiated? It behoves you to recount everything to us. Then he said everything: The saintly lord Krsna Dvaipayana Vyasa, heard everything from Sanatkumara: After hearing it from Vyasa, I relate it to you: May all listen to my words after bowing to Mahesvara.

Tho holy rit %f Pafupata

Sailadi said:

# 1Ob-I5a

O Sanatkumara, I shall recount everything precisely to you, the tranquil devotee of Rudra and of auspicious mind:

All creatures from Brahma to the immovables are Pasus of the intelligent lord. They are subject to worldly coexistence: Since he is their lord, he is known as PaSupati. The unchanging, all-pervading Paramesvara, who is the creator and who has neither beginning nor an end, binds souls by means of Maya: He alone is their saviour on being served by the path of perfect knowledge. No other saviour of those who are bound by the bonds of Ignorance is sought after or found:

# 15b-19

The twenty-four principles are the bonds of Parameethin. Siva alone binds Pasus by means of these twenty-four bonds. On being worshipped by Jivas (individual souls), Siva alone releases them from the bonds. The same lord, on being served, releases them from the bondages constituted by the ten sense-organs that originate from the Inner mind. The lord releases the souls from the bonds of tanmatras. The lord binds those who are enamoured of worldly pleasures by means of bonds constituted by the objects of senses. By service unto Paramesvara, the souls become devotees immediately: The root ebhaj means service:

# 20-22

Hence, the idea of greatest service is indicated by the word Bhakti: After binding the Individual souls, from Brahma to the blade of grass, by means of the three-fold bonds of the form of Gunas, MaheSvara himself causes the effect: On being worshipped by the Pasus by the steady path of devotion, he releases them instantaneously: Serving by means of words, mind and body is called Bhakti: It is competent to snap all bonds through the effects in view of its being the cause:

# 23-27

They know the following as mental service: viz., pondering upon the attributes of Siva such as 'He is truthful', 'He is all-pervading' etc., and the thought about his assumption of Knowledge:

Bold self-possessed persons know that the repetition of Pranava, etc: is the verbal service: The Pranayama, etc are mentioned by good men as the physical service: Thus is the bondage of all embodied beings by means of the bonds of merit and sin. Lord Siva, ParamcSvara alone is the person who releases them: The twenty-four principles are mentioned as the activities and attributes of Maya. They are called sensual objects: Through the bondage they bind the individual soul: The embodied souls who are tied by them are liberated only through devotion to Siva.

# 28.

By means of the fivefold bonds called Klesas, Sankara binds the Pasus. On being served well by means of devotion, he alone is their redeemer:

# 29.

O foremost ones among the biped beings, the five Klesas (distresses) that have become bonds are Avidya (ignorance), Asmita (egotism), Raga (lust), Dvesa (hatred) and Abhinivesa (instinctive clinging to the worldly enjoyments).

# 30.

Scholars call Avidya that is stationed in five-fold forms by the names Tamas, Moha, Mahamoha, Tamisra and Andhatamisra.

# 31.

O leading sages, the glorious Siva liberates all those jivas from Avidya. There is no other redeemer:

# 32-33.

Those who are devoted to yogic practices call Avidya as Tamas (darkness); Asmita as Moha (delusion); Raga (lust) as Mahamoha (great delusion); Dvesa (hatred) as Tamisra (darkness); Abhinivesa and Mithya jnana (misconception) as Andhatamisra (blinding darkness).

# 34.

There are eight types of Tamas. Moha is also eight. Exercising supremacy over Vitu who is the lord of Maya (delusion) is competent to remove all effects caused by Delusion.

35. The wise have said that Tamisra and Andhatamisra have eighteen subdivisions.

36-38. The relationship of Lord Siva with Avidya cannot be one that is past or one that is yet to come: Nor can it be ever due to hatred; as he is immanent; There cannot be any relationship with Abhinivesa (instinctive desire to cling to worldly pleasures) for the lord who is beyond the place of Maya, and who is worthy of being resorted to, and who is the greatest Atman: all the three periods of time Siva who is beyond.

39. In Avidya cannot have kinsmanship with Maya by means of activities, be they efficient or inefficient: the Maya of Siva the bestower of auspiciousness in all the three periods of time through the development of actions.

40. There cannot be contact with Siva who is the greatest being of the nature of enlightenment and bliss is incapable of being affected by pleasures and sorrows that continue to be present in the three periods of time: perish.

41. Mahadeva, the self-born lord of intellect; is unafflicted by fates and fortunes present in the three periods of time:

42. The lord who is the slayer of the god of Death is untouched by the impressions of rites that are present in the three units of time. He is also unaffected by the impressions of enjoyment: is the greatest of the special Male beings: He is not connected with sentient and insentient beings. He is beyond the entire universe:

48. This kinsmanship is without a beginning: He is beyond perfect knowledge and excellence: He is naturally perfectly pure:

49-50. Since he has no purpose of his own, the real purpose of all the activities of Paramesvara is blessing others. Pranava is the word that expresses Siva, the great Atman: The word Pranava is superior to the word Siva, Rudra, etc:

51-52. Undoubtedly that perfection shall become accessible—the same perfection as is obtained when people repeat Pranava even when they repeat the names of and meditate upon him who is expressed by the Pranava syllable: By virtue of his compassion towards all, the great Pasupata yoga, the basic tenet of perfect knowledge, has been mentioned strenuously by the lord of Devas.

The greatness of the consort of Uma

that is nectarinc, that is expressed by the word Om;, that is immortal, that has neither a predecessor nor a successor; that is endless and non-external. It eats something: It does not eat anything. One shall know the great lord Pasupati by the Pasupata yoga. It is by this that there is the most excellent opportunity to realize the lord:

Make the lamp of Omkara and seek the lord of the house who is subtle and who is stationed in the beginning and within. Restrain the most powerful organic wind that stays at the door [i.e: the pores] of the body and the leader of the sense-organs (i.e mind). For what reason do you nurture fear by means of a network of words? No fear is seen at all. See Siva stationed in the body: Why do you wander amongst the network of scriptural texts, that is but darkness?

After understanding this perfectly through the help of scholars after splitting the asamarasa (i.e: the state where things exist in unequalled proportions) into two, one shall resort to fearlessness in the Atman: This has been mentioned by Siva unto the sages.

# 7-124.

He is mentioned as eternally liberated, by the sages who know the principles. At the behest of Siva Paramesthin who has no beginning, middle or end as well as that of Purusa, Prakrti gives birth to cosmic Intellect:

At the behest of the self-born lord who is well known in all bodies as the Antaryamin (the immanent soul), its intellect gives birth to cosmic ego. At the behest of lord Siva, ego gives birth to the eleven sense-organs and the subtle elements. At the behest of the intelligent lord the subtle elements give birth to the gross elements entirely: At the behest of Siva all the elements bring about the contact with the bodies in the case of the embodied beings from Brahma to the blades of grass. At the behest of that lord, intellect ponders upon all objects.

# 13b-20.

Prosperity, power and riches are achieved by the lord naturally. It is at his behest that the ego takes pride in all objects; the mind becomes conscious of the objects and thinks. It is on account of his power that the ear perceives sound, the body feels touch: Thanks to the power of command of Siva, Bhava, Paramesthin that the organ of speech utters words and does not take up things from the physical body: The hand does the work of taking up and never that of motion, etc in respect to all creatures, at the control of the creator. It is due to the behest of Siva that the foot does the work of movement and not that of excretion: At the behest of supreme lord, the rectum does the work of excretion and not that of speech: The organ of generation generates at the instance of the lord: It is due to the behest of the lord that it causes pleasure to all living beings.

It is due to the bidding of great lord that the ether yields sufficient space always.

It is due to the directive from Siva that the wind sustains the bodies of all living beings through its divisions such as Prana, etc:

At the directive from the lord of Devas, the atmospheric wind having seven skandhas carries out worldly activities.

The cosmic form of Siva constitutes his physical form. The physical form of the lord, the form that is excessively honoured and worshipped is stationed in the bodies of living beings for their welfare:

The physical form of the lord in the nature of fire and identical with all Devas is the most excellent one.

The fire used by the twice-born for Homas carries Kavya to the pitrs.

The mind that is Junar in form and stationcd in the bodics of all living beings is known as the physical form of Mahadeva by thosc who ponder over facts: The Atman that is named Yajamana and is present in the bodies of all living beings is known as the physical body of Ugra by those who know the greatest Atman: Jiving beings.

Great sages aver that all the born of the fourteen different species are not different from Siva possessed of the eight cosmic bodies. They say that the bodies of embodied beings are identical with the seven bodies of Isa. The Atman is his eighth physical body and is present in the bodies of all living beings: If you wish to attain welfare resort by all means to the eight-formed lord Astamurti, the lord identical with all the worlds, thing that is beneficent.

If one is able to do some good to any living being it is as good as propitiating Mahesa with eight cosmic bodies: If one suppresses or obstructs any embodied being it amounts to perpetrating the same to Mahesa with eight cosmic forms. If protection from fear and danger is accorded to any embodied being; undoubtedly, it is the propitiation of the eight-formed lord. Helping all the people and affording shelter in times of fear is undoubtedly the propitiation of Astamurti. Leading sages say that the help rendered to everyone and the blessings offered to all is the great worship of the eight-formed lord. Blessings to other embodied beings and offerings of freedom from fear should be pursued by you if you wish to propitiate Siva.

# CHAPTER FOURTEEN

# The five Brahmans

Sanalkumira said:

0 Nandin, the most excellent among the Ganas, recount to me the five Brahmans; that cause welfare and that sanctify all the embodied beings:

NandikeSvara said:

0 most excellent one among the sons of the lotus-born deity, I shall precisely recount to you the five forms of Siva himself; called the Panca Brahmans.

Siva, identical with the Panca-Brahmans, is the sole creator, the sole protector and the sole annihilator of all the worlds.

They say that Siva is both the material as well as the efficient cause of all the worlds. That Siva is said to be of five forms.

The great forms of Siva, the greatest Atman, worthy of being the refuge of all the worlds are five. They are known by the name Panca Brahmans.

The first form of Siva Paramesthin is termed Isana. He is Ksetrajna, the knower of the field and the enjoyer of Prakrti that is worthy of being enjoyed:

What is called Tatpurusa is said to be the second physical form of the lord. That is identical with Prakrti as the residence of the supreme soul.

What is called Aghora is the third important physical form of the lord: It is the physical form pertaining to the cosmic intellect and it has eight ancillary parts beginning with Dharma:

What is called Vamadeva is the fourth important physical form of the lord: It pervades everything in the form of ego.

Vamadeva and Sadyojata. In effect, they represent the mahabhuta (five gross elements), the source of the entire universe.

The entire unit of the universe, both the mobile and immobile, is in the form of the five Brahmans. The sages who have realized the truth call that the Bliss of Siva.

He who is seen in the universe in the form of the principles is Siva and none else, who reveals himself in the form of the five Brahmans.

Hence, by all those who seek welfare, Siva, the soul of the twenty-five principles, identical with the five Brahmans, shall be assiduously thought of.

124. And anyatarh gatah_abbedam praptah_has become the constituent of the universe.

# 8

Siva is greater than both the perishable and the imperishable: So he i.c Mahadeva Mahesvara, is verily called ksaraksarapara by the learned

# 9

On pondering over all forms of the manilest; it is found that they exist collectively and individually. Therefore, He (Siva) is said to be the cause for Samasti and Vyasti.

# 10

Other also speak of him as the greatest cause: The leading sages know Samasti as the unmanifest and Vyasti as the manifest.

# I

These two are said to be the forms of Siva. Their origin from another source is not possible: It is, indeed, by virtue of being the cause of both the collective and the individual that Siva is known as Paramcsvara.

# 12

Siva is mentioned as the cause of both Samasti and Vyasti by those who are conversant with the yoga philosophy: By some Siva is cited as existing in the form of body as well as soul. Siva, for a Paramcsvara is the greatest Atman, the greatest brilliance:

# 13-14

The learned say that the twenty-four Principles constitute the body and they speak of Purusa the enjoyer by the word Ksetrajna: These two, viz, the Ksetra and Ksetrajna are the forms of that self-born deity: nothing else other

# 15-18

The learned say that there is nothing greater than Siva: They call the worldly matter consisting of elements, sense-organs, the inner organ, (will, etc:) Pradhana etc: as the Aparabrahman as a form: Some say that Siva is in the form of the supreme Brahman and the lord has neither beginning nor end: The paramabrahman is of the form of consciousness. In fact, the form of Mahesa, Siva the self-born deity is Brahman:

# 129

The lord is characterized by both forms—krara and aksara (ubhc te Sivarupe) - He is rightly called na parah (sparah), i.e. not any other. According to ST, this is Sadkhya doctrine:

656 Lingapurdpa

It is that of Sankara the great being: There is nothing other than Siva. By time; Sankara is said to be of the form of Vidya and Avidya.

19. The primordial lord Siva is the creator and ordainer of worlds: The leading sage call him alone as Vidya and Avidya.

20-26. The entire universe consists of these two forms of the self-born lord: The excellent forms of Siva are Bhranti, Vidya and Param. Some sages who are conversant with the scriptural texts have attained the excellent form of Siva by means of yoga. The perception of objects of multifarious forms is called Bhranti: The cognition in the form of the Atman is known as Vidya. The principle devoid of alternatives or doubts is called Param which is the third form of Isa. There is nothing else other than these three: By some he is said to be of the form of Vyakta, Avyakta and Jia: Paramcsvara is the ordainer and the creator of all the worlds: Poets mean by the word Vyakta the twenty-three principles and by the word Avyakta the unmanifest Prakrti: They denote Purusa, the enjoyer of the Gunas: by the word Jia: These three are the forms of Sankara: There is nothing else which is "not Sankara."

# CHAPTER SIXTEEN

# The principle of Siva

Sanatkumdra said: Once again, O extremely intelligent one, bear the truth, viz., the forms of Siva mentioned by the leading sages in different words:

Sailidi said:

2. Again and again, sage, I shall recount to you the forms of Siva mentioned by the leading sage in different words:

134: The twenty-three constitute

The principle of Siva
3. By certain leading sages and Preceptors who have crossed the ocean of Agamas (scripture), Siva is called Keetrajna, Prakrti, Vyakta and Kalitman (tul of time).

4-5. They call Purusa by the word Kectrajna and they call Pradhana by the word Prakrti: The evolutes of Prakrti are called Vyakta (the manifest). Kalale (time) is the cause of the transformation of Pradhana into the manifest Prakrti. This set of four constitutes the fourth forms of Ite.

6. Some preceptors speak of Siva Paramesvara as having the forms of Hiranyagarbha, Purusa, Pradhana and Vyakta.

7. Hiranyagarbha is the maker of this universe; Purusa is the enjoyer; the evolutes of Pradhana are named Vyakta and Pradhana is the greatest cause:

8. Know that this set of four constitutes the four forms of Siva. There is no other object different from the lord:

9-10. Some mention Isvara as having the forms of Pinda and Jati. The physical bodies of the mobile and immobile beings are Pindas, while the ordinary generalities as well as specific generality gatta is called jati: These are also the forms of the intelligent lord:

11-13. Some others mention Isa as the form of Viraj and Hiranyagarbha. Hiranyagarbha is the cause of the worlds and Viraj is identical with the world:

Some recount Siva in the forms of Sutra and Avyakrta. Indeed, the Avyakrta is the Pradhana and that is the form of Paramesthin: Just as the collection of jewels is held together in thread so also the worlds are held together by the lord. That form of wonderful exploit is known as Sutra:

14. Siva the great lord, Sambhu, Mahesvara is glorified by some as the immanent sun; by others as the great lord; by yet others as self-luminous and known:

36. 37. The group of four Predhins, Habyt, Furue ed Rlonti- tutes the lord: 438. 439.

# Lingopurino

15-16. Siva is known as one present within and as one who controls all living beings. Since he is greater than all living beings he is called Para (the great Being). Siva, Sambhu, Sankara, Paramesvara is the greatest Atman.

They know his threefold form named Prajna, Taijasa and Visva: Susupti (slumber), Svapna (dream) and Jagrat (wakefulness) are the three states wherein Prajna, etc. constitute the presiding deities. The two forms called Viraj and Hiranyagarbha are meant by the word Avyakrta. They constitute the fourth state of Siva passing through the three states. Hiranyagarbha, Purusa is mentioned as Kala. The three states are the causes of creation, sustenance and annihilation of the universe. The three states of the lord are termed Bhava, Visnu and Virinca: The embodied beings devoutly propitiate them and attain salvation:

20b-21a. The following four forms of Paramesthin, Sambhu are mentioned by the learned, viz: Kartā (doer), Kriya (action), Karya (effect) and Karana (instrument):

21b-22a. Undoubtedly the following four forms pertain only to Siva, viz. Pramatr (cognizer), Pramana (valid means of knowledge), Prameya (the object of cognition) and Pramiti (the act of cognition).

22b-25. The following are also the forms of Siva alone; like the billows of the ocean, viz: Isvara, Avyakrta, Prana, Viraj, Bhutas and Indriyas (sense-organs). They call the efficient cause of the worlds by the name Isvara. Pradhana itself is mentioned as Avyakrta by the expounders of the Vedas. Hiranyagarbha is called by the name Prana. Viraj is identical with the worlds. The word Bhuta connotes Mahabhutas (elements). The Indriyas (sense-organs) are their effects. Excellent sages glorify these as Siva's forms:

26-31. The wise know that the supreme soul is no other than the lord who has three forms: the gross body (i.e. the animal soul); (ii) taijasa, soul of the subtle body (i.e. intellectual soul); and (iii) visva, soul of the universe, i.e. universal soul, waking.

Three states of consciousness are known as Jagrat (waking state), Svapna (a dreaming state) and Susupti (a state of profound sleep). The individual soul has to pass through all these stages before he merges into the supreme soul.

The greatness of Siva

than Siva. The twenty-five principles are recounted by the learned as originating from Siva. They are also not different from him, like the series of waves that are not different from waters. They know that the principle of Siva is greater than the twenty-five categories. Hence, those principles are not different from him in the same way as the bangle is not different from the gold.

The principles Sadafiva, Isvara, etc. are born of the principle Siva and hence not different from it like the variety of jar that is not different from the material mud.

Maya, Avidya, Kriyasakti, Jnanasakti and Kriyamayi - these fields are undoubtedly born of Siva like the rays originating from the sun. If you wish to acquire welfare with all emotional attachments you shall resort to lord Siva who is the soul of all and who arranges support unto all:

# CHAPTER 8EIGHTEEN

# The greatness of Siva

Sanatkumara said:

1. Once again, O most excellent one among Devas, let listening to me hear the greatness of Siva. I am not satiated by the excellent greatness of Siva. I am not satisfied fully with your present nectarine speech:
2. How did the lord become an embodied soul? Wherefore is Rudra powerful and strong? How is he considered the Atman of all? How is the holy rite Pasupata to be performed? How was Sankara listened to by the chiefs of Devas? How was he delighted?

142. Siva-tattva is beyond twenty-five tattvas, still he is related to the tattvas as the gold is related to the ornament.

143. The five critical mays, vidya, kriya, shakti and jnana emanate from the lord's rays from the sun:

He was lordly sage superior to the universe: He was the sage equipped with all causes. At the outset, he saw Brahma, the first Deva born out of his lotus-face: He glanced at him by way of command. On being seen by Rudra, he, the lord of Devas, created everything:

# 6-7.

The Viraj (immense Being) established the order of the castes and stages of life. For the sake of sacrifice; he created the soma juice. All these originated from the soma juice: the sacrificial offering, fire, sacrifice, lord Indra the consort of Saci armed with the thunderbolt; Vispu, Narayana the glorious being and the entire earth identical with soma.

# 8-9.

Devas culogised lord Rudra by reciting the Rudra-dhyaya: The lord stood in the midst of Devas with his face beaming with pleasure: It was as though the great lord took away their wisdom. "Sir, Devas then asked lord Sankara, who are you?

# 10.

Lord Rudra said: 'O excellent Devas, I was the sole ancient Being: I continue to be the first among all beings:

# 11.

I will be so in this world. There is nothing other than myself. There is nothing separate from me. O excellent Devas, there is nothing else:

# 12.

I am both eternal and non-eternal. I am the sinless Brahma as also the lord of Brahma: I am the quarters as well as the intermediary direction: I am Prakrti as well as Purusa.

# 13.

I am Tristup, Jagati and Anustup metres of prosody. I am the omnipresent Truth, the tranquil one: I am the three-fold sacrificial fire: I am the preceptor as well as preceptor-hood: the cavity.

embodied beings is known as the physical form of Bhima by those who seek to know facts. The glowing element in the eyes of the bodies of the embodied beings is known as the physical form of Rudra by those who know precise facts. The mind that is lunar in form and stationed in the bodies of all living beings is known as the physical form of Mahadeva by those who ponder over facts.

Sages aver that all the living beings born of the fourteen different species are not different from Siva possessed of the eight cosmic bodies. They say that the bodies of embodied beings are identical with the seven bodies of Ia. The Atman is his eighth physical body and is present in the bodies of all living beings.

If you wish to attain welfare, resort by all means to the eight-formed lord Astamurti, the lord identical with all the worlds. If one is able to do some good to any living being, it is as good as propitiating Mahesa with eight cosmic bodies. If one suppresses or obstructs any embodied being, it amounts to perpetrating the same to Mahesa with eight cosmic forms. If protection from fear and danger is accorded to any embodied being, undoubtedly, it is the propitiation of the eight-formed lord. Helping all the people and affording shelter in times of fear is undoubtedly the propitiation of Astamurti. Leading sages say that the help rendered to everyone and the blessings offered to all is the great worship of the eight-formed lord. Blessings to other embodied beings and offerings of freedom from fear should be pursued by you if you wish to propitiate Siva.

# The five Brahmons

Sanalkumara said:

1. O Nandin, the most excellent among the Ganas, recount to me the five Brahmans, that cause welfare and that sanctify all the embodied beings.

NandikeSvora said:

2. O most excellent one among the sons of the lotus-born deity, I shall precisely recount to you the five forms of Siva himself; called the 'Panca Brahmans.'

3. Siva, identical with the Panca-Brahmans, is the sole creator; the sole protector and the sole annihilator of all the worlds.

4. They say that Siva is both the material as well as the efficient cause of all the worlds. That Siva is said to be of five forms.

5. The great forms of Siva, the greatest Atman, worthy of being the refuge of all the worlds, are five. They are known by the name Panca Brahmans.

6. The first form of Siva, Paramesthin, is termed Isana. He is Ksetrajna, the knower of the field and the enjoyer of Prakrti that is worthy of being enjoyed.

7. What is called Tatpurusa is said to be the second physical form of the lord. That is identical with Prakrti as the residence of the supreme soul.

8. What is called Aghora is the third important physical form of the lord: It is the physical form pertaining to the cosmic intellect and it has eight ancillary parts beginning with Dharma.

9. What is called Vamadeva is the fourth important physical form of the lord. It pervades everything in the form of ego.

123. The five forms of Siva are called Isana, Tatpurusa, Aghora, Vamadeva, and Sadyojata. In fact, they represent the five groups (Gvc grous ekmenb), the source of the entire universe.

10. What is called Sadyojata is the fifth physical form of the Lord. It is stationed in all embodied beings in the form of the mind:

41. The greatest lord Itana is the eternal Paramesthin: He is stationed in all living beings in the form of the sense-organ ear.

12. Lord Tatpuruga is stationed in the bodies of the embodied beings in the form of the sense-organs of touch:

13. The great lord Aghora is glorified by the learned as stationed in the eyes in the bodies of all living beings:

14. Vimadeva is known as firmly established in the sense-organ tongue in the parts of the embodied beings:

15. It is mentioned that Sadyojata is stationed in the bodies of all living beings in the form of the sense-organ of smell:

16. It is said that Isana is stationed in all the bodies of living beings in the form of the organ of speech.

17. Learned men say that Tatpurusa is stationed in the bodies of all embodied persons in the form of the organ of action, the hands:

18. Those who know the truth say that Aghora is stationed in the bodies of all living beings in the form of the organ of action, the feet:

19. Sages say that Vamadeva is stationed in the bodies of all living beings in the form of the organ of action, the rectum:

20. Lord Sadyojata is stationed in the bodies of all living beings in the form of the organ of generation: It is said by those who are conversant with the Vedic and scriptural texts.

21. The sages and Devas mention that lord Isana is the lord of living beings, that he is of the subtle form of sound and is the cause of the firmament:

22. Leading sages say that lord Tatpurusa is in the subtle form of touch and is the cause of the wind:

23. Persons conversant with the Vedas say that the terrible lord Aghora in the subtle form of Rupa is the cause of the fiery element.

# The five Brahmans

24. Those who know the real principles say that the well-known lord Vamadeva being in the subtle form of Rasa is the cause of the waters:

25. All those who know the real principles praise the great lord Sadyojata as the cause of the earth element in the subtle form of smell:

26. Leading sages say that the primordial lord Isana is the wonderful entity in the form of the firmament:

27. The wise know that lord Tatpurusa is the Wind, in view of his pervading all the worlds.

28. Those who know the meanings of the Vedic texts speak of the noble-souled Aghora as having the form of the fire worshipped by all, enlivening in regard

29. In view of his nature to the Universe, the sages know the great lord Vamadeva as having the form of water. They mention him to be pleasing to the mind. Wise men know that lord Sadyojata is in the form of the earth:

30-33. He is the preceptor of the world: He is the sole great sustainer of the universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings:

The entire unit of the universe both the mobile and immobile is in the form of the five Brahmans. The sages who have realized the truth call that the Bliss of Siva.

He who is seen in the universe in the form of the twenty-five principles is Siva and none else, who reveals himself in the form of the five Brahmans.

Hence, by all those who seek welfare, Siva the soul of the twenty-five principles, identical with the five Brahmans, shall be assiduously thought of.

# CHAPTER FIFTEEN

Sanatkumdra said:  O chieftain of the goblins, O highly intelligent, of great qualities, thou art omniscient, recount once more the grandeur of Siva.

Scilidi said:  O sage, listen to the greatness of Siva which I shall tell you now: It has already been mentioned by many excellent sages in different words:

1. The wise speak of Siva of the form of (Sat" and Asat" as also the lord of %Sat" and (Asat" and the sages say also the same: living beings.
2. With the effect of the manifest, it is called existent and the unmanifest is called non-existent because it has no second.
3. Both the existent and the non-existent are the forms of Siva. There is nothing else other than Siva. Since he is the lord of both of them, Siva is called Sadasatpati.
4. Some sages who ponder over realities speak of Siva Mahesvara as ksaraksaratmakal? identical with the perishable and the imperishable as well as that which is beyond.
5. The unmanifest is called imperishable and the manifest is cited as perishable: These are the two forms of Sankara.

According to ST, this refers to the doctrine of Nyaye philosophy. The all-pervading is eternal (nitye) as well as non-eternal (anitye). This better quality he derives from his functions &#x26; Jiv: ST offers another interpretation of 'ud-uad'. 'd' is manifest (vyakta) while 'ased' is unmanifest (avyekee). In fact, manifest (vyakto) and unmanifest (tvyekto) are the attributes of prakrti-pradhant while the lord is the cognizer (Jis) of both prakrti as well as pradhana.

The lord is both perishable as well as imperishable. Since he is all-pervading, he identifies himself with the perishable being, Jiva etc. He is ever existent: He is also called imperishable (ekeara) because...

alone; and there is nothing greater than himself:

8. Siva is greater than both the perishable and the imperishable: So he i.e Mahadeva Mahesvara, is verily called ksaraksarapara by the learned:

9. On pondering over all forms of the manifest; it is found that they exist collectively and individually: Therefore; He (Siva) is said to be the cause for Samasti and Vyasti:

10. Others speak of him as the greatest cause: The leading sages know Samasti as the unmanifest and Vyasti as the manifest:

These two are said to be the forms of Siva. Their origin from another source is not possible: It is, indeed, by virtue of being the cause of both the collective and the individual that Siva is known as Paramesvara.

12. Siva is mentioned as the cause of both Samasti and Vyasti by those who are conversant with the yoga philosophy: By some Siva is cited as existing in the form of body as well as soul, Siva, lora Paramesvara is the greatest Atman; the greatest brilliance: The learned say that the twenty-four Principles constitute the body and they speak of Purusa the enjoyer by the word Ksetrajna: These two, viz, the Ksetra and Ksetrajna are the forms of that self-born deity: nothing else other

15-18. The learned say that there is nothing else than Siva. They call the worldly matter consisting of elements, sense-organs, the inner organ, (will, etc) Pradhana etc as the Aparabrahma form. Some say that Siva is in the form of the supreme Brahman and the lord has neither beginning nor end. The paramabrahman is of the form of consciousness. In fact, the form of Mahesa, Siva the self-born deity is Brahman:

29. The lord is characterized by both akshara and akyara (ubbe to Sivarupe) He is rightly called na parah (=eparah) i.e. not any other. According to ST, this is Sadkbya doctrine.

30. Jcaryah. According to ST: this refers to the yogint Mabyendra and others, but this purana cannot be posterior to Mabyendr of Vedantins.

31. ksetra-ksetrajna-rupin - this refers to the doctrine

33. According to some Iciryas, the lord is identical with the subtle elements:

Lingapurdna
It is that of Sarkara the great being: There is nothing other than Siva. By time; Sankara is said to be of the form of Vidya and Avidya.

19. The primordial lord Siva is the creator and ordainer of worlds. The leading sage call him alone as Vidya and Avidya.

20-26. The entire universe consists of these two forms of the self-born lord. The excellent forms of Siva are Bhranti, Vidya and Param. Some sages who are conversant with the scriptural texts have attained the excellent form of Siva by means of yoga. The perception of objects of multifarious forms is called Bhranti. The cognition in the form of the Atman is known as Vidya. The principle devoid of alternatives or doubts is called Param which is the third form of Iga. There is nothing else other than these three: By some he is said to be of the form of Vyakta, Avyakta and Jna. Paramesvara is the ordainer and the creator of all the worlds. Poets mean by the word Vyakta the twenty-three principles and by the word Avyakta the unmanifest Prakrti. They denote Purusa, the enjoyer of the Gunas: by the word Jna. These three are the forms of Sankara. There is nothing else which is not Sarkara.

# CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

# The principle of Siva

Sanatkumdra said:

1. Once again, O extremely intelligent one, I wish to hear the truth; viz, the forms of Siva mentioned by the leading sages in different words:

2. Again and again, I shall recount to You the forms of Siva mentioned by the leading sages in different words:

134: The twenty-three entities constitute Pratd_te nameat fr {85.

---


# Th principle %f Siva

3. By certain leading sages and Preceptors who have crossed the ocean of Agamas (scripture), Siva is called Kvetrajma, Prakrti, Vyakta and Kalatman (soul of time):

4-5. They call Purusa by the word Kectrajma and they call Pradhana by the word Prakrti. The evolutes of Prakrti are called Vyakta (the manifest). Kalat (time) is the sole cause of the transformation of Pradhana into the manifest Prakrti. This set of four constitutes the fourth forms of Ite:

6. Some preceptors speak of Siva Paramcsvara as having the forms of Hiranyagarbha, Purusa, Pradhana and Vyakta.

7. Hiranyagarbha is the maker of this universe; Purusa is the enjoyer; the evolutes of Pradhana are named Vyakta and Pradhana is the greatest cause.

8. Know that this set of four constitutes the four forms of Siva. There is no other object different from the lord.

9-10. Some mention Isvara as having the forms of Pinda and Jati. The physical bodies of the mobile and immobile beings are Pindas, while the ordinary generalities as well as specific generality satta is called jati: These are also the forms of the intelligent lord:

11-13. Some others mention Isa as the form Hiranyagarbha. Hiranyagarbha is the cause of the worlds and Viraj is identical with the world: Some recount Siva in the forms of Sutra and Avyakrta. Indeed; the Avyakrta is the Pradhana and that is the form of Paramesthin. Just as the collection of jewels is held together in a thread so also the worlds are held together by the lord. That form of wonderful exploit is known as Sutra:

14. Siva the great lord, Sambhu, Mahesvara is glorified by some as the immanent soul; by others as the great Lord; by yet others as self-luminous and self-known:

36. o the up-manifest in the process of transformation into the manifest (Preltt).

# Lingopurano

15-16. Siva is known as one present within and as one who controls all living beings: Since he is greater than all living beings he is called Para (the great Being). Siva, Sambhu, Sankara, Paramesvara is the greatest Atman:

They know his threefold form named Prajna, Taijasa and Visva: Susupti (slumber) Svapna (dream) and Jagrat (wakefulness) are the three states wherein Prajna, etc constitute the presiding deities. The two forms called Viraj and Hiranyagarbha are meant by the word Avyakrta: They constitute the fourth state of Siva passing through the three states: Hiranyagarbha, Purusa is mentioned as Kala. The three states are the causes of creation, sustenance and annihilation of the universe. The three states of the lord are termed Bhava, Visnu and Virinca. The embodied beings devoutly propitiate them and attain salvation.

20b-21a. The following four forms of Paramesthin, Sambhu are mentioned by the learned; viz: Kartr (doer), Kriya (action), Karya (effect) and Karana (instrument).

216-22a. Undoubtedly the following four forms pertain only to Siva, viz. Pramatr (cognizer), Pramana (valid means of knowledge), Prameya (the object of cognition) and Pramiti (the act of cognition).

22b-25. The following are also the forms of Siva alone, like the billows of the ocean, viz: Isvara, Avyakrta, Prana, Viraj; Bhutas and Indriyas (sense-organs). They call the efficient cause of the worlds by the name Isvara. Pradhana itself is mentioned as Avyakrta by the expounders of the Vedas: Hiranyagarbha is called by the name Prana. Viraj is identical with the worlds. The word Bhuta connotes Mahabhutas (elements). The Indriyas (sense-organs) are their effects. Excellent sages glorify these as Siva's forms.

26-31. The wise know that the supreme soul is no other than the lord in three forms: (i) Prajna, soul of the gross body; (ii) Taijasa, soul of the subtle body i.e. intellectual soul; and (iii) Visva, soul of the universe, i.e. universal soul. Three states of consciousness are known: Jagrat (waking state), Svapna (dreaming state) and Susupti (state of profound sleep). The individual soul must pass through these stages before merging into the supreme soul.

than Siva. The twenty-five principles are recounted by the learned as originating from Siva. They are also not different from him, like the series of waves that are not different from waters. They know that the principle of Siva is greater than the twenty-five categories. Hence, those principles are not different from him in the same way as the bangle is not different from the gold.

The principles Sadadiva, Isvara, etc. are born of the principle Siva and hence not different from it like the variety of jar that is not different from the material mud.

Maya, Avidya, Kriyasakti, Jnanasakti and Kriyamayi—these five are undoubtedly born of Siva like the rays originating from the sun. If you wish to acquire welfare with all emotional attachments you shall resort to lord Siva who is the soul of all and who arranges support unto all.

# CHAPTER 8EIGHTEEN

# The greatness 0f Siva

Sanatkumara said:

1. Once again, O most excellent one among Devas, let listening to me bear the greatness of Siva. I am not satiated by the excellent greatness of Siva. I am not satisfied fully with your present nectarine speech:
2. How did the lord become an embodied soul? Wherefore is Rudra powerful and strong? How is he considered the Atman of all? How is the holy rite Pasupata to be performed? How was Sankara listened to by the chiefs of Devas? How was he delighted?

Siva-tattva is beyond twenty-five tattvas, still he is related to the tattvas like the gold is related to the ornament or the ocean to the waves.

Sailadi said; Sthanu; Sive, the great cause originated from the unmanifest.

4-5. He was a lordly sage superior to the universe: He was the sage equipped with all causes. At the outset, he saw Brahma, the first Deva born out of his lotus-face: He glanced at him by way of command. On being seen by Rudra, he, the lord of Devas, created everything:

6-7. The Viraj (immense Being) established the order of the castes and stage of life: For the sake of sacrifice, he created the soma juice. All these originated from the soma juice: the sacrificial offering, fire, sacrifice; lord Indra the consort of Saci armed with the thunderbolt; Vigpu, Narayana the glorious being and the entire earth identical with soma.

8-9. Devas eulogised lord Rudra by reciting the Rudra-dhyaya. The lord stood in the midst of Devas with his face beaming with pleasure: It was as though the great lord took away their wisdom. (Sir, Devas then asked lord Sarkara, who are you?)

10. Lord Rudra said: "O excellent Devas; I was the sole ancient Being: I continue to be the first among all beings:

11. I will be so in this world. There is nothing other than myself: There is nothing separate from me. O excellent Devas, there is nothing else:

12. I am both eternal and non-eternal. I am the sinless Brahma as also the lord of Brahma: I am the quarters as well as the intermediary direction: I am Prakrti as well as Purusa.

13. I am Tristup, Jagati and Anustup metres of prosody: I am the omnipresent Truth, the tranquil one: I am the threefold sacrificial fire: I am the preceptor as well as Preceptorhood. I am the Cow. I am the cavity: I am always perceptible in the impenetrable depth: I am the eldest and best of all the principles: I am the lord of the waters:

15. I am the water; lord Isa; fery brilliance, the sacrificial altar; I am the Rgveda, the Yejureeda, the Samaveda. I am the self-born deity.

16. I am the Athareoveda, the mantra, the most excellent among the Angiras; I am the Itihasa, the Purana; the Kalpalt (science of Ritual) as well as the Kalpana (imagination): I am the imperishable and perishable;

17. I am forgiveness, calmness, forbearance; the secret of all the Vedas, the most excellent and the unborn One.

18. I am the holy Pupkara: I am the middle and beyond it: I am the exterior and interior. I am the unchanging one in front:

19. I am the brilliant light as well as darkness. I am Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara: I am the cosmic intellect; ego, subtle elements and the sense-organs. Everything.

20. O excellent Devas, he who knows to be myself; is alone omniscient; Jw Paramcsvara, the soul of all.

21-22. O excellent Devas, by means of my brilliance, I propitiate the cow by means of the cows; the brahmins by means of the brahminical power; longevity and offerings by means of longevity; truth by means of truth- I and Dharma by means of Dharma: I propitiate all by my own brilliance:

After saying this at the outset, the lord vanished there itself:

23-24. Thereupon, Devas did not see lord Rudra: Including Narayana and Indra, Devas and sages meditated upon him who was the greatest Atman and the greatest cause: With their arms raised up they praised and propitiated him.

1-3. Lord Rudra alone is identical with Brahma, Visnu and Mahesvara. He is Skanda; he is Indra; he is the fourteen worlds, Asvins, planets, constellations, stars, firmament; quarters, elements, sun, moon and the eight planets. He is Prana, Kala, Yama, Mrtyu and Amrta. He constitutes things of the past, present and future; he is the universe as well as truth. Obeisance to him:

4. At the outset you had been the universe, you are Bhuh, Bhuvah and Svah: At the end also you are of the form of the universe: You are always at the head of the universe:

5-6. You are the sole Brahman. You are dual in form, triple in form. You are beneath. You are the lord of Devas. You are peace, nourishment; and contentment: You are what is offered and what is not offered in Homa. You are the universe and non-universe. You are what is given and what is not given. You are Isvara: You are what is done and what is not done: You are certainly the great Deva and the lesser Deva. You are the greatest goal of the good as well as of the bad: You are Sankara.

7-8. May we drink soma juice and become immortal. May we approach light and not go to Devas. Indeed, what will the enemy do to us? Is death synonymous with immortality? This form of Siva is beneficent to the universe. It is divine, imperishable, subtle and unchanging:

9-10. It is holy. It pertains to Prajapati. It is gentle. It cannot be comprehended. It is unchanging: It can be grasped by the mind just as the wind is grasped by a gaseous thing:

He is both blue and red since both Pradhana and Purusa merge in him. Since the semen flows out from him he is termed Sukla:

Lord himself makes people attain yoga.1 Lord Mahesvara, the Lord of Devas is, therefore, called "Bhagavan."

25. It is the great lord (Mahesvara) who grasps the worlds duly: He, the lord of Devas, creates everything and resides in them sportively.

26. It is this lord who is present in all quarters: He is the one born at the outset and also one who enters into the foetus: He is one who is born or one who will be born: O men of inferior sight, he stands with his faces all round.

27. He should be assiduously worshipped, this unchanging lord from whom the words recede after not reaching him along with the mind.

28. What the organ of speech utters strenuously is without grasping him: He is the greatest refuge whether Apara or Para.

29. The organs of speech call him omniscient, Nilalohita. This tawny coloured Siva is the Purusa. Obeisance to him.

30. He is the great Rudra, he is the whole universe in the past, present and future, in many ways, here and there: gold-armed!

31. The lord is the consort of Uma; the bull-bannered lord is gold-semened:

32-34. The lord is odd-eyed. He is the creator of the universe, his vehicle is the universe: It is he who, at the outset, created Brahma as his eternal son and gave him perfect knowledge revealing the Atman. Those who perceive Rudra the sole Purusa, oft-invoked and oft-eulogised, having the form of fire, the excellent Deva in the middle of the heart; the lord stationed in the Atman and having the size of the tip of hair are self-possessed and courageous: Theirs is the perennial tranquillity, not of the others.

38. He is the truthful Brahman. He is the Purusa dark and tawny-coloured. He is Virupakea of sublimated sexuality. He is Isana the source of origin of Brahma.

39. He is the ancient Isana who presides over the fivefold physical body. He is the sole Isvara who occupies the Yoni (the phallus that is put in the symbol of the pudendum muliebre) breaths. They call him the Linga (symbol) of the mind wherein the qualities of anger, desire and forbearance persist: By dispelling desire that is at the root of the series of causes of worldly existence and by stabilising it in Rudra, he should be meditated upon by means of the intellect:

40. They call him Rudra, the perpetual Paramesvara and the most fixed and greater than the greatest Being:

42-44. One shall meditate upon him who is the procreator of Brahma, Visnu, Vahni (Fire god) and Vayu (Wind god). A sadhaka should purify himself by means of fire: He shall separately sanctify his limbs. Then the five elements shall be compressed in the order of their origin and qualities. At the outset, the five Matras shall be contemplated upon, then four, three; two and one in due order: Then the deity shall be meditated upon without any Matra stabilising him at the cerebrum: Becoming immortal thus, one shall perform the Pasupata rite.

Devas said:

1. O lord Sankara, it behoves you to relate this: By what means are you to be worshipped by the twice-born? Where? In what form?
2. Who is authorized in thy worship? O lord, how is the brahmin authorized? O lord, how are the Ksatriyas authorized? O bull-bannered one, how are the Vaisyas authorized?
3. How are the women and the Sudras authorized? How are the bastards and illegitimate sons of widows authorized? For the welfare of the worlds, it behoves you to mention everything to us.

Sada said:

On seeing the fervent emotion of the sages, Nilalohita, Sadasiva stationed in the mystic diagram said in a majestic tone:

Devas and sages saw the lord of Devas in the company of Uma in the Mandala in front of them: His lustre was like that of ten million streaks of lightning: He had eight arms, four faces and twelve eyes. He had big mighty arms. Half of his body was female in form. He wore the coronet of matted hairs: He was bedecked in all ornaments. He wore red garlands and had smeared red unguent over his body: He who was the cause of creation, sustenance and annihilation was clad in red garments, pleasing in appearance.

His face to the east was yellow in colour: That is in the form of Tatpurusa: to the right (i.e: to the south) in the Aghora form was comparable to a mass of blue collyrium:

1. Rudra, Mahadeva, the grandfather stationed in the mystic diagram is worthy of being worshipped by the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaisyas as well:

2. For the Sudras, the service rendered to the worshipper is enough: Undoubtedly women are not authorised to perform worship.

3. If the worship is conducted through women and Sudras shall derive the same benefit: In order to help kings special worship shall be conducted by Brahmins and others.

4. May the Brahmins and others worship Sadasiva thus. After saying thus, lord Rudra vanished there itself:

5. All those noble-souled sages and Devas bowed down to the lord: They were excited due to meditation on Rudra.

disciple of Vyasa, now mention the sacred doctrine of Agni and the sacred scripture thereof recounted by Siva for the achievement of virtue, love, wealth and salvation. It was mentioned by Siva the lord of Devas, with a desire for the welfare of devotees. After performing an elaborate penance difficult to be practised by Devas and Danavas he extracted this doctrine from the Vedas, the six ancillary treatises as well as from the systems of philosophy, Samkhya and Yoga: It extends to a hundred crores of verses. It is full of meaning: It contains behests. It is a great hidden secret: It decries ignorance: In some respects it agrees with the orthodox religion based on the four castes and stages of life: In some respects it is antagonistic to it.

There, in that doctrine, how is the worship of the lord? How is the sacred ablution, yoga etc? We are eager to hear about it.

Sita said:

12-14. Formerly, Nandisvara the son of Silada, the lord of the Ganas and a favourite of Siva, was asked thus by Sanatkumara on the peak of the splendid Meru: After bowing down to him the chiefs of all sages put the same question to him. O leading sages, may ye now listen to that doctrine of perfect knowledge narrated to Sanatkumara by the delighter of his race.

15-17. This doctrine pertaining to Siva is the gist of what is mentioned in the Vedas or is defined by Siva. It is devoid of eulogies and rebukes and is capable of giving immediate conviction. Resulting from the grace of elders and preceptors it is a divine doctrine that yields salvation without strain.

Sanatkumara said:

"O Sailadi; how is the worship of Siva to be performed for the realisation of virtue; love, wealth and salvation: It behoves you to recount this to me who have approached you in all humility."

Sita said:

lent among eloquent ones, mentioned the opportune moments, occasions, necessary qualifications for practising this.

Sailidi said:

19-20. I shall mention the necessary qualifications revealed by preceptors and the scriptural texts: The nomenclature of Saiva preceptor (the propounder of Saiva doctrines) is based on his gravity and not otherwise: Acarya (preceptor) is so called because he practises the doctrines himself; stabilises others in the practice of those doctrines and gathers together the topics mentioned in the scriptural texts.

21-23. A true devotee shall search for a preceptor following the qualifications = He must be conversant with the principles expounded in the Vedic passages. He must be one lying down in Bhasman. He must be graceful and pleasing in appearance. He must feel the necessity of acquiescing in the delight of the general public: He must be a follower of the Path of Srutis and Smrtis. He must be one who accords fearlessness by means of his learning. He must be devoid of covetousness and ficklemindedness. He shall be one who scrupulously fosters proper conduct and adherence to customs and conventions. He must be bold and self-possessed. He must cling to accepted usages and conventions: After finding out such a preceptor the devotee shall worship him like Siva with every sort of emotional attachment.

24. The disciple must propitiate him in accordance with his faith and financial capacity. He must serve him physically and by monetary gifts. He shall continue serving him till he becomes pleased:

25. If that highly blessed personage is delighted the bonds of the disciple shall snap instantaneously. The preceptor shall be honoured and worshipped. The preceptor is Sadasiva himself:

26. The preceptor shall test the brahmin disciples for three years by sending them on errands here and there and by giving them only such articles as will sustain their life:

27-32. The excellent person shall be engaged in the meanest of jobs and the base person shall be engaged in the loftiest.

ones: If they do not resent beings scolded or beaten they are the most deserving disciples. The following types of Brahmins become deserving disciples: Those who are learned in Saiva doctrines, who are devoted to the holy rites pertaining to Siva; who are righteous and self-restrained; who follow the path of Srutis and Smrtis; who endure all Dvandvas (mutually clashing opposites); who are self-possessed and perpetually persevering mentally; who are engaged in rendering help to others who are devoted to the service of the preceptors; who are tender-hearted, healthy and straightforward; who are loyal and faithful; who speak pleasing words and are not arrogant; who are intelligent and without rivalry and covetousness; who are endowed with the qualities of cleanliness and adherence to the conventions; who are free from haughtiness and maliciousness and who are engaged in devotion to Siva. Persons like this, who are endowed with disciplined conduct thus should be further sanctified for the purity of principles:

1. A disciple who is pure; who is richly endowed with the quality of humility, who eschews false pretensions and harsh words and who obeys the behests of preceptor deserves blessings.
2. The preceptor who is conversant with the scriptural texts, who is intelligent, who is favourably disposed towards common people, who performs penance, who is engaged in following accepted worldly conventions and who knows the principles is known as one who bestows salvation.
3. He may be endowed with all characteristic qualities; he may be an expert in all sacred texts, and he may be conversant with all means and modes, but if he is devoid of the real truth, all the other qualities shall be futile to him.
4. If he has no decisive knowledge of the Atman which is self-evident great principle, he is not blessed himself. How can he bless others?

Hence, those liberated tuls who are conversant with the principles (realities) can redeem others. The principle that produces perfect cognition originates from his greatest bliss.

# 40.

Only he who has understood the truth can be a guide unto bliss and not one who is a preceptor only in name but who is devoid of cognition:

Such people cannot redeem one another. Can rock redeem another rock? Those who have perfect cognition only in name can have salvation only in name.

Command that causes the destruction of bonds is instantaneously born by the sight and touch of the yogins or even by conversing with them:

Or, the preceptor may enter the physical body of the disciple by the yogic path and enlighten him by means of the yogic power after understanding all the entities.

# 44-47.

The three-fold purity mental, verbal and physical is ordained by the path of knowledge. The preceptor shall test the disciple, ascertain his piety and virtue as well as his knowledge: He must test him to find out if he is devoid of faults whether he is a Brahmin; Kshatriya or Vaisya. The preceptor shall whisper from ear to ear and from the knowledge shown perceive what he has known: The preceptor's line shall thus be perpetuated duly as in the case of lamps where one lamp is lighted from another. O highly blessed one, what are called tattvas consist of the following: Bhauvanam; Jw0 Padam, Varnakhvar Matram, and Kaladhvara. Only he who cuts across these tattvas can realise Siddhi after salvation by means of his own ajna sakti (will power) through the mercy of the preceptor.

The holy water should be inspired with the holy part of Vedic Samhita and Rudradhyaya hymns. The disciple shall take initiation in the presence of Siva, the fire, and his preceptor. After initiation, he shall practice in accordance with the behest of the preceptor: It is better to abandon life, or cut off one's head rather than take food without worshipping lord Sadasiva. The rite of initiation shall be performed thus. The worship shall be performed in due order: One shall perform the worship of Paramesvara three times or at least once a day.

79. The rite of Agnihotra, the recital of the Vedic mantras and the sacrifices consisting of many monetary gifts are not on a par with even the sixteenth part of the worship of the Linga of Siva.

80. He who worships Siva even once is like that person who always performs sacrifices, who always gives charitable gifts and who always performs penance taking in only air.

81. Those who worship Mahadeva once, twice, thrice or continuously are Rudras. There is no doubt about this: A non-Rudra shall neither touch Rudra nor worship nor glorify him: A non-Rudra shall not attain Rudra.

The southern face has blue colour; the northern face is very red. His western face is as white as cow's milk.

In his hands on the right side he holds the javelin, axe, sword, thunderbolt and Sakti. In the hands to the left he holds the noose, goad, bell, serpent and the excellent dart. His hands show the gestures of granting boons and freedom from fear. The rest is as mentioned before: He wears all kinds of ornaments and garments of diverse colours. He shall worship lord Siva whose form is the Vedanga, who is the most excellent of all excellent Devas and who is the lord of Brahman. He shall worship him with all fervour.

The five Brahmans have already been mentioned: Now listen to the Sivangas (the ancillaries of Siva). O sages of good holy rites, listen also about heart etc., that are the Saktis.

Om the lord is Isana of all lores: Obeisance to Hrdaya the Bija of Sakti. Om the lord is Isvara of all living beings. Obeisance to the head, containing Amrta.

Of good holy rites, I shall mention the mantras pertaining to the sun, viz, Baskala and others. O sage of good holy rites, the Angas are the gist of all the Vedas.

“Om Bhuh, Om Bhuvah, Om Svah, Om Mahah, Om Janah, Om Tapah, Om Satyam, Om Rtam, Om Brahman.

This nine-syllabled mantra is glorified as Baskala: It is called Aksara because it does not perish in this world: Satyam (truth) is called Aksara: It is prefixed with Pranava (i.e., Om) and suffixed with Namah (obeisance).

# 21. Om Bhurbhuvah Svah

We meditate on that excellent radiance of the lord, the effulgence that urges and guides our intellect: Obeisance to the sun, the greatest planet in the firmament.

All the holy rites are to be performed in the Siva fire. He shall meditate on lord Isvara originating from the Angas of the five Brahmans. The Murti of Siva is seated on the seat of red lotus. He is turned into the Sakala form assiduously: O sage of good holy rites, the Murti is meditated upon.

4. He shall worship the lord with that mantra as well as the Pranava. The greatest of all the worship is that of the trident-bearing lord Aghora.
5. O sage of good holy rites, the actual worship and all the holy rites in the fire are common: But the difference is in the mantras for that lord and in the meditation on Aghora.
6. 8. This is the mantra: "Obeisance to you: Obeisance to Aghoras who are terrible, very very terrible: Obeisance to all Sarvas. Obeisance to those in the forms of Rudras" (angnyasa is done as follows using the above mantra). {Obeisance to Aghoras. Obeisance to the tranquil heart; and then to the terrible ones: Svaha in the head of all Atmans and Brahmans unto those very very terrible ones; Vasat in the tuft with clusters of flames, unto all and all Sarvas.

The viewing of the Linga is holy. Touching it is holier than viewing it: Undoubtedly, O son of Brahma, there is nothing that excels the worship. It cannot be recounted in detail even in the course of a hundred crores of years.

# The mode of charitable gifts.

Seta said: the self-born lord performed ablution and bowed down to Siva, the lord of Devas. He saw lord Rudra Nilelohita by his divine vision. He eulogised Siva the bestower of boons by repeating the Rudradhyaya mantras:

# The mode of charitable gifts

With great pleasure the lord said for once: At the close of your reign you will attain salvation by performing holy rites alone. After saying this he vanished there itself;

After bowing down to the full-bannered lord, Manu the son of the self-born lord ascended the great Meru mountain like Siva ascending the great bull:

There he saw the son of Brahma, the golden-complexioned bestower of boons, Sanatkumara who was endowed with all Yogic powers:

Manu, of great lustre joined his palms in reverence; he bowed down to the bestower of boons, of the form of Brahman, one favourable to the brahmins and he eulogised him.

Sage Sanatkumara had the sense of horripilation on seeing Manu. He, the storehouse of kindness, then spoke kindly:

Sanatkumara said:

# 7-1.

You have come here after seeing and obtaining the rite of ablution from Siva the tranquil lord of all, from Nilalohita. Whatever it be, if you are desirous of speaking, speak on.

On hearing his words Manu bowed down to him with palms joined in reverence and said: "O saintly lord, it behoves you to tell us how one attains salvation by holy rites alone. O saintly lord, salvation is achieved by perfect knowledge. In some places it is attained by means of the combination of the two."

On hearing his words, the saintly lord Sanatkumara, the storehouse of the wisdom of the Vedas and the foremost among the knowers of Sruti, said:

"Salvation is obtained, O sage, by means of holy rites and the combination of the two gradually. But it is attained instantaneously by means of perfect knowledge:

# 12-15.

Formerly by not honouring the lord Nandin duly, I had attained the state of a camel due to his curse. Thanks to the grace of Nandin; I worshipped lord Siva and became the son of Brahma. Thanks to the holy rites I attained the divine excellent goal. It was only by practising the holy rites pertaining to Siva and by worshipping him in various ways and not otherwise:

Sixteen types of charitable gifts which the kings shall bestow upon were mentioned by Nandin for attaining virtue; love, wealth and salvation.

# The mode of performing Jivacchraddha rite.

The sages said:

Thus, the sixteen auspicious rites of charitable gifts have been mentioned by you. Now it behoves you to narrate the procedure of the Sraddha rite for the living ones.

Sita Said:

I shall succinctly mention the mode of Jivacchraddha that is approved of by everyone. Formerly, it was mentioned by Brahma, the lord of Devas to Manu, to Vasistha, to the well-disciplined Bhrgu and Bhargava. It is great and conducive to the achievement of all Siddhis: Listen ye with great fervour, O sages of good holy rites, I shall mention the manner and order of the Sraddhas, the order of those who deserve Sraddhas and the peculiarities of the Jivacchraddha:

The Jivacchraddha shall be performed on mountain, on the banks of river, in a forest or in one’s abode as also when death is imminent. When it is performed he is liberated even as he is alive; whether he does or does not perform the functions (ordained for him), whether he possesses perfect knowledge or not; whether he is well-versed in the Vedic passages or not, whether he is Brahmin or a Ksatriya or a Vaisya or whether he follows the path of the Yoge. There is no doubt about this.

The ground shall be carefully scrutinized by its smell; colour; taste etc. All the weeds and stumps shall be assiduously taken out: The middle of the ground, a cubit in extent; shall be covered with sand. If Kunda is dug it shall be long and splendid or the bare ground shall extend to an arrow's length: The ground shall be scrubbed, cleaned and smeared with cowdung and fire shall be placed there in accordance with the injunctions in the scripture: Water shall be sprinkled all round. The rites pertaining to the fire shall be performed and concluded along the traditional lines as mentioned.

Balls of rice shall be given as before in eight ways separately: He shall feed thousand brahmins and give them Daksinas too.

Or the devotee shall feed a single person engaged in the practice of Yoga: He shall strictly adhere to the Bhasman and shall have strict control over his senses. The Mahacaru shall be dedicated unto Rudra for three days:

Only particular things (about Jivacsraddha) have been mentioned here as other things are similar to all other Sraddhas: If the devotee dies the Sraddha may or may not be performed, since he becomes a liberated soul.

He can perform or eschew the obligatory and the optional rites. Even if any kinsman of his dies there is neither pollution nor purification of the same:

His post-natal pollution can no doubt be cleansed by mere bath: If afterwards he himself begets a son or a son is born to his wife; he shall perform all the holy rites for him. That son shall become a knower of Brahman. If a daughter is born to him, O sages of good holy rites, she will become one like Ekaparna or Aparna. Persons born in her family are liberated from hell: There is no doubt about this. By means of this holy rite his ancestors on his father's as well as mother's side are liberated:

When this brahmin passes away he shall either be buried after digging the ground or he shall be cremated. By performing all the duties of a sadhaka there cannot be any defect: He is not to attain any further salvation by means of later holy rites. Everything has been mentioned by Brahma to the sages of sanctified souls. Again this was mentioned to Sanatkumara by that intelligent lord.

Indra, the lord of all Devas, the unborn lord Vishnu, the lord of everything, the excellent sages including Guru, the preceptor of Devas, the groups of Devas, Asuras and excellent men - all these imagined themselves to be identical with the Linga. On hearing these words in the Heaven, the sage of the six great spiritual families, endowed with concentration, eschewed everything and attempted to install the lord. The sages of holy rites then asked the sinless Suta about the installation of the Linga. Their voices were choked with delight:

Sila said:

5. I shall mention succinctly, duly and precisely, the installation of the lord in the form of Linga for obtaining virtue, love, wealth and salvation, with great assiduity.

The devotee shall clean the Linga along with the pedestal and then devoutly install it; The pedestal of the Linga is goddess Uma and the Linga is Mahesvara himself: By worshipping these two, the lord and the goddess are worshipped. By their installation, the lord of Devas is installed along with the goddess. Hence, the most excellent among the installers shall install the Linga along with the pedestal:

There are other forms of lord Visnu due to the curse of Bhrgu:

3. The devotee shall perform the worship of the sacred fire. Homas shall be performed in the same manner as the worship, one thousand, five hundred, or hundred and eight times. Homas shall be performed with gingelly seeds mixed with curds, honey and ghee: Homa performed with ghee, fried grain flour and honey dispels all miseries.

5. By means of japa performed in accordance with the injunctions, hundred and eight times and thrice a day; one shall undoubtedly be rid of all miseries. If he performs the japa, a thousand and eight times, Siddhis occur to him within six months. Even the kings and rulers of provinces achieve Siddhis. There is no doubt about this.
6. By means of a thousand times japas, fever is dispelled. If a devotee performs thousand Homas thrice a day with milk and continues this for a month, he attains excellent good fortune within a month: If a devotee performs Homa with the mixture of honey, ghee and curds for a year, he achieves Siddhis. If Homa is performed by means of barley, milk and ghee or good rice; lord Aghora is delighted.

angeyuktena along with the ancillaries, brdeye, etc:

iHustrioue Sukre, son of Bhrgu and disciple of Aghora. Due to its grace Hiranyakaa became the Valorous leader of Daityas. He conquered the three worlds along with Devas, Asuras and men. He begot a son, Andhaka of charming exploits, who became the chief of the Ganas. He ruled over the world and was ultimately killed by lord Varaha (Boar):

1. Perpetual victory cannot be attained by one who commits atrocities on women, children or cows in particular: There is no prosperity in this world by following this Path.
2. Goddess earth was brought down to nether regions by that Daitya. But the power was rendered ineffective by lord Aghora. At the end of a thousand years, he was killed by Varaha (Boar) - Hence; in order to master Aghora mantra, one should not harass brahmins, women or cows. I am telling you the greatest of secrets; nay, the secret of secrets.
3. This rite should be performed by mighty kings against violent assailants and desperadoes: It should not be practised against brahmins or against the overlord of one's own realm. This excellent rite shall be performed when a very formidable and invincible enemy has arrived, or when one's entire army has been slain or when the battle has been waged on sinful lines. The rite shall be performed by one who is devoid of mercy through a merciless person. There is no doubt, that the moment it is performed the power of Nigraha is attained.
4. O excellent brahmins, the man shall repeat the Aghora mantra of terrible form, hundred thousand times. To the extent of ten thousand times he shall perform Homa with gingelly seeds. He shall duly worship the lord with hundred thousand white flowers, on Bina linga or in the sacred fire: The mantra is mastered thereby, otherwise he does not become seer nor has he any Siddhi etc; Only one who has mastered the mantra shall perform the following rite in the cemetery. Only scholarly and intelligent brahmin who has mastered the mantra and who is sanctified by Siva, shall perform the rite for his own or for the welfare of the king: The learned man shall fix eight tridents in the eight quarters beginning with the east and ending with the north-east.

Formerly this Vidya of Goddess Vajresvari was assiduously obtained by Brahma for rendering help to Indra:

# 7-8.

O sages of good holy rites, formerly Tvastf, Prajapati's son, was killed by Indra. He became inimical to Indra and performed a sacrifice wherein Soma juice was extracted. Indra of huge arms who had suppressed Visvarupa desired for the share in the Havis in that sacrifice:

# 9.

(O Indra you have killed my son: I will not give you share: You do not deserve that since you killed my son Visvarupa: After saying this, he spread his power of delusion over the entire hermitage with his Maya.

# 10-14.

But the suppressor of Visvarupa pierced through the Maya and seized the Soma juice by force and drank it along with his attendants. Then the infuriated Prajapati took the remaining part of Soma and consigned it to the fire saying "O enemy of Indra, Aourish. Svaha." Then a demon named Vrtra appeared there. He resembled a black fire: He was called Vrtra because he abided by his vows. Indra fled from there: He abandoned Heaven instantaneously. Being fled he fled along with his attendants. Then the delighted lord Brahma the creator of the Universe, said to him:

# 15-20.

So suppressor of enemies, hurl this thunderbolt and kill him." Then the lord of Devas of mighty arms got ready along with Devas and killed him without any strain: He became free from ailments: Hence; Vajresvari Vidya is terror unto all enemies: The demons called Mandehas are conquered every.

Sita said:

The various applications of Savitri mantra are for enslaving; attracting, causing hatred, exorcising, paralysing, deluding; beating, extirpating, splitting, killing, hindering, stunning the army and similar activities.

Mantra: May the Goddess, the bestower of the boon come down to the earth on the top of the mountain. O Goddess, permitted on behalf of the brahmins go comfortably. O brahmins, it is only after taking leave of the earth by this mantra, one should know that she is to go and not otherwise:

After performing all the preliminary external rites and the rites of enslaving etc: he shall ritualistically dismiss the deity: Then he shall kindle another sacred fire duly: He shall invoke the goddess once again, perform Japa and worship too. He shall duly perform Homa too over again in the fire:

784 Liigopurano

1. Then he shall accomplish the holy rites with the same mantra. He who seeks the ability to enslave others shall perform thirty thousand Homas by means of Jati flowers:
2. O brahmins, in the rite of attracting, Homa shall be performed with ghee and Karavira flower: In the rite of causing hatred; Homa shall be performed with Langalaka flower. The rite of exorcising shall be performed with oil; the rite of paralysing shall be by means of honey; the rite of deluding with gingelly seeds, that of beating with the blood of a donkey or elephant or camel: The rite of paralysing shall be performed with mustard seeds. The rite of tearing up shall be performed with Kusa grass. O sages of good holy rites, the rite of killing and exorcising with Rohisle seeds, the rite of binding with Ahipatra and that of making the army stunned with Kunati trumpet flower. Then he shall perform the worship of Paramegvari with ghee, for the achievement of all Siddhis. Purification is obtained by Homa with milk pudding:
3. The destruction of ailments is caused by gingelly seeds; wealth can be gained through lotus; splendour with Madhika flower; Homas in each case being thirty thousand in number, repeating the Savitri mantra: All the rites beginning with Jaya and ending with Svista shall be performed as before: Thus the application of mantras which is very vast has been succinctly mentioned to you: Or one can repeat mantra alone after worshipping in accordance with the injunctions. Even then he shall attain all Siddhis: No doubt need be entertained in this respect:

# CHAPTER FIFTYTHREE

# The rite of conquering Death

The sages said

2. O sage of great intellect; you are omniscient:

319-331. Robi, Abipatr and Kunati. Some particular plans are intended.

# CHAPTER FIFTYFOUR

# Worship with Triyambaka mantra

Seta said: Excellent brahmins; I shall mention the rite of conquering death: Of what avail is much talk? Repeating the Rudradhyaya mantras, the devotee performs hundred thousand Homas with ghee, in due order. For Homas, the following materials can be used: Gingelly seeds with ghee, lotus, Durva grass mixed with ghee and cow's milk, honey, Caru along with ghee or mere milk. Thus the remedy against Death or the god of Death has been recounted:

Seta said: With the Triyambaka mantra one shall worship the three-eyed lord of Devas in a Banalinga or in a self-born Linga. Those who wish to prolong their lives and those who are conversant with the Vedas shall worship Siva with thousand and eight white lotuses or thousand red lotuses or a thousand blue lotuses. After the worship, one shall give milk pudding, cooked rice soaked in ghee, cooked green gram and rice mixed with honey, fragrant sweets and other edibles. He shall perform Homa in the fire with the flowers mentioned before as well as with Caru in particular: He shall perform japa hundred thousand times and perfectly conclude everything in due order. He shall then feed thousand brahmins and offer them Dakshinas. After giving a thousand cows, he shall in the end give gold also.

Thus, everything including the secret doctrines has been succinctly mentioned to you: This had been formerly mentioned to Skanda of unmeasured splendour on the top of the mountain Meru by the trident-holding Siva, the lord of Devas. This was then mentioned to the intelligent son of Brahma by Skanda the lord of Devas.

786 Lingopurana

This was then mentioned to Vyasa by Sanatkumara the well-wisher of the worlds. Thus, this has been handed down traditionally:

10. When Suka passed away the highly-blessed great sage Vyasa saw the three-eyed lord Rudra and dispelled his misery.

11-12. The sage listened to the story of the birth of Skanda: As he stayed there the glory of Triyambaka mantra was fully mentioned to him: Thanks to his grace I shall now mention everything to you:

13. One shall repeat the Triyambaka mantra after duly worshipping the lord. One is liberated from all sins accumulated in the course of seven births:

14. He shall gain victory in the battle and attain incomparable good fortune. He who seeks a realm shall acquire it by performing a hundred thousand Homas and shall be happy:

15. He who seeks a son shall undoubtedly attain a son with a hundred thousand Homas of this mantra: He who seeks wealth shall unhesitatingly repeat the japa million times.

16. He will be fully and perfectly endowed with riches, food grains and all other auspicious materials. He will play with his sons and grandsons. When he passes away he will go to heaven.

17. O sages of good holy rites, there is no mantra on par with this one both in the world and in the Vedas. Hence;

18-23. The fruit thereof shall be eight times the benefit of Agnigtoma sacrifice:

The word Triyambaka is interpreted thus. He is the lord of the three worlds, three Gunas, three Vedas, three Devas, and three castes—brahmins, ksatriyas and vaisyas. He is expressed by the three syllables "A", "U", "M". He is the lord of the three fires; viz., the moon, sun and fire: Uma, Amba and the source of origin of the three-syllabled.

40.


---

# Worship with Triambaka mantra

Mahadeva constitute the trio. So he is Triyambaka the lord of the three:

(The word Sugandhi in the mantra is interpreted thus): The splendid fragrance of a tree in full bloom is wafted to a great distance. Similarly is the fragrance of the great lord. The lord is fragrance for the holder of fragrance unto all other Devas. His fragrance is wafted in this world and in the firmament when the wind blows; Hence, the attribute Sugandhi refers to the lord. Now the word "Pustivardhanam" is interpreted:

24-26. Formerly, the semen of the lord Siva was deposited in the womb of Visnu. It was from this semen that the cosmic golden egg, the source of origin of Brahma originated. The nourishment of his semen extends beyond the moon, sun, stars, earth, Bhuvah; Svah; Mahah, Tapah and Satya. The five elements, the cosmic ego, the cosmic intellect and Prakrti are nourished by his semen virile: Hence, the lord is Pustivardhana (the increaser of nourishment).

27-28. The word Yajamahe (we worship) is interpreted: We worship that lord duly and devoutly by performing Homas with ghee, milk, honey, barley, wheat; black gram, Bilva fruits, lilies, Arka flowers, Sami leaves; white mustard and Sali rice grains in the Linga.

29-30. Now the latter half of the mantra is interpreted: By the grace of this Rta (systematic worship) let me be released from the bondage of actions and reactions as well as the fetters of death: Let me be released from the glitter of worldly existence: Just as the ripe cucumber fruits fall out from their stalks when the season arrives, so also the time for liberation has come by the grace of this mantra:

31-35. One shall worship Siva's Linga after understanding the meaning and the rites of this mantra. That Yogin shall sever all bonds. He can control death. O sages of good holy rites, there is no other lord so merciful as Triyambaka. He is propitiated and delighted easily: So is the mantra: Hence, one shall forsake everything and worship the three-eyed lord of Uma.

repeating this Triyambaka mantra. He shall worship with great concentration whatever may be his plight; he shall undoubtedly be liberated from all sins by the meditation on Siva and he shall become Rudra himself: Although one incurs sins by killing and piercing living beings or by cating and enjoying unjustly he shall be liberated from all sins by remembering Siva alone once:

# CHAPTER FETYPIVE

# The mode of propitiating Siva

The sages said:

1. How shall the three-eyed lord, the bull-bannered lord of Devas be meditated upon for realizing all Siddhis, through the Yogic path? O sage of good holy rites, everything has been heard by you formerly and in detail: It is equal to the knowledge of the Vedas But it behoves You to recount everything succinctly once again.
2. O sages of good holy rites, Nandin having the lustre of the sun was asked in a similar manner by the son of Brahma on the mountain Meru formerly: He was surrounded by the group of sages: As Sanatkumara, the son of Brahma, bowed down to him he told him in confidence and with great concentration:

NandikeSvara said:

Thus, lord Mahadeva, Nilalohita was formerly asked by the goddess Amba, the daughter of the mountain lord; On the peak of Kailasa the lord was asked by the goddess while he sat in the same bed with her and while he was in the height of ecstasy:

The practice and repetition of the japas along with meditation is Mantrayoga. The blood vessels are to be kept spotlessly pure by means of Recaka (exhaling). The Air (Prana) is to be conquered cumulatively and severally:

# Sparsayoga

There is firm and strong action due to the splendid activities of the retention of birth etc. The practice of Kumbhaka (retention of air), illuminated by the three Dharanas, is called Sparsayoga. It cleanses the three viz. Visva, Prajna and Taijasa:

# Bhavoyoga

That state which is devoid of mantra and sparsa but Mahadeva is called Bhavoyoga: The lord is stationed and resorts to dividedly within and without: The annihilatory aspect of the lord is manifest: It accords purity of the mind.

# Abhavayoga

The parts of the universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings become dissolved: Everything becomes void: The form too of the lord loses its semblance: This is called Abhavayoga which causes extinction of the mind:

# Mahayoga

That meditation in which the form appears pure without colour; which is auspicious, independent and unspecifiable, which has light and splendour always and is self-evident all round is called Mahayoga. The Atman alone pure and self-luminous rises perpetually (in it). Self-luminosity, the

is Purc is known Mahayoga. It comes Up from the entire mind:

All these Yoges bestow powers of Anima (minutenees) etc: and perfect knowledge:

# 18-20.

In these Yogas the latter are better than the former. The state of Mahayoga is devoid of contact with the ego. It is great and comparable to the vast firmament. It is devoid of all coverings. Although it is incomprehensible yet it is knowable by its own nature: It is great, submerged, self-evident, and self-knowable: It shines in its blissful body. Therefore, it is considered to be knowable:

# 21.

It should be given to a tested disciple, who maintains the sacred fires, who is virtuous and not ungrateful. It should be given in due order, gradually.

# 22-25.

It should be given to one who is devoted to the preceptor and the deity: Otherwise it should not be given. If so, he will be born sick, short-lived and censurable: He who gives also becomes like this, O sinless lady. Hence; one should avoid giving without testing the disciple:

My devotee shall be free from all attachments, shall consider Me as the greatest resort; be endowed with perfect knowledge, and become an expert in the rules laid down in the Srutis and Smrtis. He shall be devoted to the preceptor, meritorious, eminently qualified, and always devoted to Yoga: Thus, O gentle lady, the eternal Yogic path has been recounted. O lady of slender waist; it is the honey that exudes from the lotuses of the Vedic and Agama lores.

# 26-28.

After drinking the Yogic nectar the Yogin, the most excellent among the knowers of the Brahman, becomes liberated. Thus is the most excellent Pasupata Yoga. It bestows all the prosperities and prowess of the Yogas and needs no other support. It is declared as such for the sake of salvation: By whom is it obtained? O beloved one, it is obtained only by those who are engaged in worshipping Siva and whose conduct is lovable.

After saying thus the bull-bannered lord bade farewell to the goddess. Posting Sankukarnae at the gate he entered Samadhi (a state of yogic trance).

# Th mode %f propitiating Siva

Sailadi said

# 29-31.

Hence; O leading Yogin, O son of the self-born Lord, be engaged in the practice of Yoga. The supreme lord is certainly identical with Brahman. Hence; by all means, the wise person seeking salvation shall always perform ablution with Bhasman. He must be engaged in the Pasupata Yoga: In due order; the Sakti pertaining to Visnu shall be meditated upon: Thereafter, the Para Sakti of Mahesvara shall be meditated upon. Thus, stable practice of a leading yogin has been succinctly described to you.

Sita said

# 32-35.

Thus, Pasupata Yoga has been recounted by the intelligent Nandin, the son of Silada, who scrupulously adheres to Bhasman. Sanatkumara the saintly lord mentioned it to Vyasa of unmeasured splendour: I heard it from him. At their behest, I mentioned it to the sages who perform the Satra. I am gratified: Obeisance to the brahmins and to the Yajnas. Obeisance to the tranquil one; to Siva. Obeisance to sage Vyasa.

# 36-43.

This excellent Lingapurana contains eleven thousand slokas. The first section contains hundred and eight chapters: The second section contains fifty-five chapters: It yields virtue, love, wealth and salvation.

Then the sages of the Naimisa forest bowed down to lord Isana with great concentration and mental purity: Out of pleasure their body showed horripilation: After composing this branch of the Purana, the eleventh one; the self-born lord Brahma spoke these words, "He who reads the Lingapurana entirely, from the beginning to the end, he who narrates it to the brahmins, and he who listens to it, attains the highest goal. He attains that highest goal which is attained by penance."

tacrifices, by charitable gifts and by thc study of the Vedas He attains the scriptural lore pertaining to the Vedas. The brahmin will attain the faculty of renunciation either by action or by knowledgc or by the mixturc of both: His devotion will becomc permanent. May that noble soul have faith in me and in lord Nulayapa. Learning shall continue in his family and hc ghall not err in anything: This is the behest of Brahma: Hence, all these are attaincd by his grace:

The sages said:

When the brahmins said this, the pious sages Narada touched the body of Suta with the tip of his splendid hands and said: "0 Sita, hail to thee: Wellare unto thee: May You bhave faith in the bull-bannered lord. May wc too have thc gamc. Obeisance to Lord Siva "
