# CHAPTER ONE

# Introductory

Obeisance to the Supreme Soul, Rudra, Vishnu and Brahma, the lord of Pradhana and Purusa, and the cause of creation, sustenance and dissolution.

2-4. The sage Narada went to Naimisa after worshipping Siva, in all the holy centres; viz. Sailesa, Sangamesvara, Hiranyagarbha, Svarlina, Avimukta, Mahalaya, Raudra, Gopreksaka, the excellent Pasupata, Vighnesvara, Kedara, Gomayukesvara, Hiranyagarbha, Candresa, Isanya, Trivistapa and Sukresvara:

5. On seeing Narada, the residents of Naimisa were delighted in their minds. After honouring him they offered him befitting seat:

The Saive Puranes trace the origin of Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra to the Supreme Spirit (Maheshvara) and assign the functions of creation, existence and dissolution of the universe to each respectively. In fact, the three gods represent the three attributes - sattva, rajas and tamas which together form Pradhana - the original source of the universe. Thus, the trinitarian pattern of the Cosmos is a single whole at its best. Cf. Depi Bhaga. 1.8. 2-4.

2. Pradhana - the primary or un-evolved matter, the original source of the material world.

Purusha - the twenty-sixth principle represented as the aspect of the working of Prakrti - the creative force. He is distinguished from the personal soul (jiva) as the latter is the enjoyer of the fruit of the World-Tree. Cf. I. 28.7; II. 17. 26-27.

3. Narada - the mind-born son of Brahma and divine sage who acts as a messenger between gods and men.

Naimisa or Naimita, mod. Nimger. It is situated in the Sitapur district in the Uttar Pradesh, on the left bank of the Gomti river. The place is called because the rim (nimi) of the revolving wheel of virtue was battered here and virtue had to make permanent abode in this region (Cf. 2.7). Or the place is called because here men were destroyed by the sage Gurumukhe in the twinkling of an eye: (Cf. Varaha quoted in ST:) On the authority of the Matsya Purana, Borooah (Ancient Geography of India) places it about the confluence of the Gomati river. For detail about the holy centres, see part [1. @b. 98.

6-17. He too being pleased accepted the seat offered by the excellent sages. Seating himself comfortably on the excellent seat and duly worshipped by the sages he discussed with them the holy narrative of the Lingas, the narrative consisting of wonderful anecdotes: At the very same time, the intelligent Suta who was well-versed in the Puranas came to Naimisa for offering homage to the sages. The residents of Naimisa greeted him duly with holy songs and adorations, since he was the disciple of Krena Dvaipayana. On seeing the truly trustworthy and scholarly Suta Romahargana there arose in them the desire to hear the Purana. They, thereafter, asked him about the meritorious Purana that contained the glory and greatness of the Lingas.

The residents of Naimisa said adoring the sage Krsna Suta, of great intellect; after Dvaipayana for the knowledge of the Puranas you have obtained the Puranic lore from him. Hence, O Suta, the best among the Paurapikas, we desire to hear from you that Puranic lore illustrating the glory of the Lingas. Narada, the glorious son of Brahma, after completing his pilgrimage to the holy centres of the supreme Lord Rudra and worshipping the Lingas therein; has arrived here. You are a devotee of lord Rudra: So also are we and Narada. It behoves you to recount the meritorious Purana containing the glory and greatness of the Lingas in the presence of this sage. Since, everything (relating to Dharma) has been successfully achieved by you, it should all be well known to you.

Thus told, Suta, the most gifted among the Paurinikas was delighted in his mind. He, the meritorious one, made obeisance.

6. Krene Dvaipayana Vyasa was the son of Parashara by Satyavati who later on married king Santanu. He composed the Mahabharata of the Puranas and arranged the Vedas into four compendiums (Vosu I.60. Hf).

7. Romahargana or Lomahartana was one of the five disciples of Vyasa (Vadu. 60. '9; SP. Vidyesvara-Sankhya; 4.7). He was assigned the duty of preserving Puranic tradition while the other four Paurinikas, Vaishampayana, Jaimini and Sumanta were entrusted with the task of preserving the Vedas. He is called Suta but he is a Brahmin. He should not be confused with the Suta of mixed caste who was the offspring of a Kshatriya father and Brahmin woman described in Manu (Manusmriti X. [17]).

8. Repeated in verse 10 of this chapter.

18. After bowing to Siva, Brahma and Visnu, I remember the leading sage Vyasa in order to recount the Linga Purana.

19-24. I bow down to the supreme lord whose body is Sabda-Brahman, who is the revealer of the Sabda-Brahman, whose limbs are the letters whose characteristics are unmanifest, but who manifests himself in diverse ways, who is constituted by the letters a, 4, m, who is gross as well as subtle, who is greater than the greatest; who has the form of Om, whose face is the Rgveda, tongue the Samaveda, throat the Yajurveda, and heart the Atharvaveda, who is the lord beyond Pradhana and Purusa, who is devoid of birth and death and who is called Kalarudra when he assumes tamoguna and Brahma when he assumes rajoguna and the all-pervading Visnu when he assumes sattvaguna, who is Mahesvara when devoid of all the gunas, who manifests first in seven forms by enveloping the body of Pradhana, then in sixteen forms, and finally in twenty-six forms, who is the source of origin of Brahma, and who assumes the form of the Linga merely for the sport of creation, sustenance and annihilation (of the universe). After bowing down faithfully to that supreme lord, I begin recounting the auspicious narrative of the Linga Purana.

9. Repeated in I.6.30.

10. septadha a group of seven tattvas consisting of intellect (buddhi), ego (ahankara) and five subtle elements (tanmatres).

11. sdafadha-five genres of action (Karmendriyas), five senses of knowledge (jnanendriyas), five gross elements (mahabhutes) and mind.

12. To the twenty-three categories (see Note 10, 11) we added Pradhana (twenty-fourth), Jiva (twenty-fifth) and Purusa (twenty-sixth); to this group of twenty-six we added another (the twenty-seventh) namely the supreme lord (mahesvara).

# CHAPTER TWO

# Index of Content

Spta said

1-3. Formerly the excellent Lingapurana was composed by Brahma, the great soul. It was based on the events that happened in the Isana kalpa, and originally it contained crore of verses among a hundred crore that comprised all the Puranas: The Puranas were abridged into four hundred thousand verses by Vyasas in the different manvantaras. Later in the beginning of Dvapara, they were classified into eighteen parts, beginning with Brahmanda among which this Lingapurana ranks as the eleventh. Thus I have heard from Vyasa.

4. O brahmins, the number of verses in this Purana is eleven thousand. I shall succinctly narrate it now, as it has not been heard by me in detail:

5. When the Puranas were abridged into four hundred thousand verses by Krsna Dvaipayana, the Linga was abridged in eleven thousand verses. Of Pradhana is mentioned,

6. At the outset the creation then the primary and secondary creation and then the origin of the cosmic egg, enveloped by eight sheaths.

7. Then, the evolution of Brahma through the cosmic egg, by the force of rajoguna, the evolution of Visnu and Rudra, and Vienu's lying down in the waters:

# CHAPTER THREE

# Primary Creation

Seta said

1. The non-characterized is the root of the characterized: The manifest Prakrti is the characterized, while Siva is the non-characterized, but the characterized (Prakrti) is said to be related to Siva.
2. They call the characterized by the name Pradhana or Prakrti. But the non-characterized, devoid of smell, colour, taste, sound, touch and attributes; is Siva who is stable and everlasting: [On the contrary] the characterized Pradhana or Prakrti is endowed with smell, colour, taste, sound and touch; it is the source of origin of the universe; it is elemental both in subtle and gross forms, O excellent brahmins; it is the physical body of the worlds; it has originated from the non-characterized, of its own accord:
3. [Formerly] it split itself into seven as well as eight and then into eleven. The non-characterized, thus, becomes characterized through maya.
4. ST. adds another interpretation. The order of contents (as stated in this chapter) is not observed here (i.e. in this purana) nor are the contents described in detail.
5. The twenty Principles emanate from the Septavimbaks tattva: the twenty-fourth, the three of twenty-three principles is intentional; cannot butow Mabetvera (the...)

Primary Creation

6-9. From them took shape the trio of the important deities: From one of the three the universe arose; it is protected by another; by one (i.e: the third) it is destroyed.1 In this manner the universe is pervaded by Siva. Thus the three murti's have been classified as alinga, linga and lingalinga. Brahman itself is the universe. The non-characterized lord is the source of the seed: He, the Supreme lord, is both the seed and the womb as well as the seedless. Being seedless he becomes seed, i.e. the cause of the universe: The term Atman applies to the seed (bija), womb (yoni) and the unmanifest matter (pradhana).

10. He who is Rudra, Brahma and Visnu is called Siva in the Purapnas by virtue of his eternally and intrinsically enlightened and pure nature. Observed by Siva became Saivi.

11. Prakrti, when being observed by brahmins, formerly it was unmanifest; but intrinsically endowed with the attributes it became manifest at the beginning of the creation.

12. The entire universe beginning with the unmanifest and ending with the gross elements originated from it: That Saivi Prakrti, the creator of the universe is known as aja (the unborn). The individual soul is devotedly attached to that aja (the unborn Prakrti) of red, white and black colour - the aja that is single, though the mother of many. He resorts to her in her manifest form, and having enjoyed eschews her when he becomes unattached. This Prakrti is the creator of worlds when she is presided over by Purusa.

13-14. At the time of the creation, mahat was evolved, at the behest of Purusa, out of Pradhana consisting of the three gunas and presided over by Purusa.

15. Being urged by the desire to create, the mahat when twenty-seventh alone is capable of extending grace to his devotees. In this context, Pradhana or Prakrti is apratibuddha, Jiva is buddhiman, Purusa is buddha and Maheivara is prabuddha.

16. Brahma, Vignu and Rudra - the personified entities of the three gunas - rajas, sattva and tamas that constitute Pradhana or Prakrti, the material cause of the universe - are responsible for the creation, sustenance and destruction of the universe. The three emanate from the transcendent reality Maheivara. (Cf. Devi Bhaga.1.8.4; Brahmanda 1.4.6; Viequ 1.2.66) For detail see V.S. Agrawal MP - A Study, PP: 37-41.

# Linigopurana

presided over by Purusa enters the unchanging, unmanifest Pra-dhina and effects the creation of the manifest.

17-18. Out of mahat evolved (1) sattvika ahamkara characterized by conception and determination, (also) (2) rajasa ahamkara consisting of three gunas but with rajas as prominent, (also) (3) tamasa ahamkara with tamas as prominent: The subtle elements evolved out of mahat and became the nucleus for all creation.

19. The subtle element-sound evolved out of ego and from it the unchanging ether. Thereafter the ego, the cause of sound enveloped the ether.

20. O brahmins, the creation of the gross elements from the subtle elements is expounded in this manner: O great sages, the subtle element 'touch' evolved from the ether and the air evolved from that:

21. From the air evolved the subtle element colour and therefrom agni (fire), whence evolved the subtle element taste, whence the waters. From these evolved the subtle element smell and from it the earth.

22-23. O excellent brahmins, the ether enveloped the subtle element touch. The air with the activity of blowing enveloped the subtle element colour. The fire enveloped the subtle element taste. The waters having the nature of taste enveloped the subtle element smell:

24-25. Hence the earth has five qualities; the waters have four; the fire has three; the air has two, the ether has one quality. Thus the creation of the elements originated from the subtle elements through their mutual interaction.

26. The Vaikarika as well as Sattvika creation takes place simultaneously, yet, here; it is explained as evolved gradually in the manner described above:

27. For the purpose of perceiving sound and the rest there are five organs of sense and five organs of action. Mind (which is also sense) belongs to both categories: (These eleven senses evolve out of ego.)

28. The constituents of creation beginning with mahat (intellect) and ending with Visesa (earth) generate the cosmic beginning with mahat (intellect) and the...

# Primary Creation

cgg, whence Brahma arose like a water-bubble

29. He alone is Rudra and Vishnu pervading the universe: These worlds are within that cosmic egg and this universe is within it:

30-33. The cosmic egg is externally enveloped by water ten times its magnitude: The water is externally enveloped by fire ten times its mass. The fire is externally enveloped by air ten times its mass. The air is externally enveloped by the ether ten times its magnitude: The ether is enveloped by ego the cause of sound: The ego is enveloped by intellect and intellect is enveloped by Pradhana. They say that the coverings of the cosmic egg are seven! There within is Brahma seated on the lotus: There are crores and crores of such eggs in existence.

34. In all these cosmic eggs there are four-faced Brahmas, Vishnus and Rudras. They are all created by Pradhana after coming into contact with Siva.

35. The dissolution is also mutual but it begins from the end and goes up to the beginning: The great lord is the sole agent for this creation, sustenance and dissolution.

36. In creation he is endowed with rajas, in sustenance with sattva and with tamas in dissolution: He alone possesses this subtle nature in due order.

37-39. He is the first creator of all and annihilator: So lord Mahesvara is the overlord of Brahma: He is also known as Siva, Sadasiva, Bhava, Vignu and Brahma since he is all. All these worlds are in this egg, so is the creator Brahma. Thus the elemental creation of Prakrti has been described by me: It is auspicious creation with intellect (mahat) at top is primordial.

18. The Seven coverings of the Cosmic Egg consist of intellect (mahat),

# CHAPTER FOUR

# Inauguration of Creation

Suta said

1-2. The period of the duration of the Prakrita creation is said to be a day of Brahma. There is a similar period constituting the night: The lord effects creation during day time and dissolution during the night. He has neither a day nor night (as we understand the terms). The time-duration by day and night is used in a secondary sense.

3-6. During the (so-called) day all the Vikrtis - the Videvas, the Prajapatis and the sages stay by. During the night all of them are dissolved: They are produced (again) at the end of the night: A day of His constitutes our kalpa, His night too similarly another kalpa. There are fourteen Manus by the time thousand sets of four yugas come to a close: O brahmins, the Krta yuga consists of four thousand years. Four hundred, three hundred, two hundred and hundred years respectively constitute the period of transition both at the beginning and end of a yuga.

7-9. The amsaka, therefore, is one-sixth of the duration of each yuga. The period of duration of Treta, Dvapara and Kali is respectively three thousand, two thousand and one thousand years without their amsaka parts. That of Krta has been mentioned above: O men of holy rites, fifteen winks in the eyes of man of normal health in normal condition constitute kastha. Thirty such kasthas make one kala. Thirty such kalas make one muhurta.

10-12. The night contains fifteen such muhurtas and the another fifteen muhurtas. A (lunar) month according to human.

19. Each yuga is prefixed and suffixed by sandhya which specifies the advent and culmination of a yuga. The two sandhyas of a yuga are of equal length though their period of duration differs from yuga to yuga. Thus Krtayuga lasts for four thousand divine years and its sandhyas for eight hundred such years; Treta lasts for three thousand divine years and its sandhyas for six hundred such years; Dvapara lasts for two thousand and its sandhyas for four hundred; Kali lasts for one thousand and its sandhyas for two hundred such years. The total period of duration for the four yugas is ten thousand divine years and that for their sandhyas is two thousand divine years.

The period of Uttarayana (northern transit of thc sun) is the day for themanes; the period ol Daksinayana (southern transit of thc sun) constitutes thcir night: Thcse days and nights are calculated in accordance with thc reckoning of' thc devas. Thirty human years constitute divinc month: 0 brahmins, a hundred human years constitutc three divinc months and tcn days. Thrce hundred and sixly human ycars constitute a divine Year.

Lingopurdna

Sixty thousand human years: Thus the duration of the four yugas; without the period of junction and transition totals to three million six hundred thousand human years: If Sandhya periods are included, the set of four ages will consist of four million three hundred and twenty thousand years: A little over seventy-one sets of four yugas - Krta, Treta, Dvapara and Kali - constitute a manvantara. The number of human years in a manvantara are thirty crores six million and seven hundred and twenty thousand, O excellent brahmins: The period of a manvantara, according to this Purana, is not more than this.

The number of years in one set of four yugas have been mentioned earlier. O excellent brahmins, a thousand such sets of four yugas constitute a kalpa (of Brahma).

During Brahma's night the creatures perish; at the end of the night they are created again. There are twenty-eight crores of gods who move in aerial chariots.

During the manvantaras and the intermediary periods their number increased to three hundred and ninety-two crores: O brahmins, during the last kalpa their number came to seventy-eight thousand: In all kalpas this is the position in brief: When the dissolution is imminent people abandon the persons surviving the last day of the kalpa and go to Janaloka from the world Mahar.

The number of years in half kalpa by divine calculation is two thousand eight hundred and two crores and seven millions. The kalpa too shall be similarly calculated. A thousand such kalpas make a year of Brahma.

Eight thousand years of Brahma make his Yuga. A thousand yugas of Brahma constitute a savana. Nine thousand such savanas constitute a day of Rudra: O great sages, the following are the names of some kalpas of Brahma, viz - bhavya, bhavodbhava, tapas, rambha.

A manvantara comprises about seventy-one mahayugas which equal to 12,000 years of the god. The Puranas mention fourteen manvantaras. These derive their names from fourteen successive mythical progenitors and sovereigns of the earth.

50. At the dissolution of kalpa, whatever remains of creation produced during day and night is destroyed:

51-53. The destruction is subject to the behest of lord Siva: When the creation is annihilated and the Pradhana is stationed in itself; both Pradhana and Purusa come to standstill or remain inactive. O brahmins, it is only when the three gunas are not in equilibrium that creation takes place: When they are in equilibrium the creation is dissolved; The great lord is the cause of both: The creation is effected by him sportively in this manner.

54-56. Such creations, effected through the agency of Pradhana are innumerable. The kalpas together with their Brahmas and Visnus are innumerable: But lord Siva is only one. The activities of Prakrti emerging from Pradhana are due to His sport. The activities as characterized by the gunas are threefold and destructible but the (uncreated) atman has neither a beginning nor a middle nor an end:

57. The life-time of Brahma consists of two halves called parardhas. What is created during His day time is destroyed during His night:

58-61. The worlds bhur, bhuvah, svar and mahar perish; only the worlds above remain intact: At night; when the mobile and immobile perish and a vast sheet of water spreads like a single ocean, Brahma goes to sleep in the water; He is there-

21. Creation is the result of stimulation (keobha) of the Gunas. When there is no stimulation, creation does not exist; consequently, the time-units—kalpas, manvantaras, Yuges, samvetearas and other relatively bigger and smaller units disappear as a matter of course.

22. Kalpa (a period of four thousand cycles of four Yuges) constitutes a day of Brahma. It is divided into two halves, parardhas. A half kalpa covers a cycle of two thousand caturyuges. At the end of a full kalpa great fire consumes the worlds:

23. Ekarpava symbolizes the state of the universe at the time of dissolution when the divided units are drawn together forming a thick watery mass. For detail MP -A Study. PP. 9-10.

Forc known as Narayana. At the end of the night he wakes up and beholds a void what used to be the world of mobile and immobile beings: Then he, the most excellent among the knowers of Brahman decides to create. He assumes the form of a boar and lifts the earth submerged in the waters. He lifts it up and places it as before; together with all the rivers, rivulets and oceans.

62-63. With great effort he makes the earth even. He gathers together all the mountains burned by fire on the earth: He establishes the four worlds, bhuh, etc. as before. He, the lord creator, then decides to create everything afresh.

# CHAPTER FIVE

# Creation

Sita said

1. O brahmins, while Brahma of unknown origin pondered on creation he became manifested as delusion enveloped in darkness. Ignorance originated from the self-born Brahma in five forms: darkness (tamas), infatuation (moha), the great infatuation (mahamoha), gloominess (tamisra), and blinding gloominess (andhatamisra).

5-8. At first the horizontal creation named tiryaksrotas emerged from him; the next was urdhvasrotas chiefly characterized.

rized by goodness. Then came arvaksrotas, after that anugraha, and lastly bhutadi. The first creation of Brahma is known mahat; the second of tanmitras as bhautika; the third of the sense-organs as aindriya; the fourth of the immovables as mukhye; the fifth of animals as tiryagyoni; the sixth of gods as daivika; the seventh of mankind as manuea; the eighth (of emotions) as anugraha; the ninth of Kumaras as Kaumarya. These are Prakrta and Vaikrta creations.

9-11. Formerly, 0 excellent sages, Brahma created Sananda, Sanaka and Sanatana. By refraining from worldly activities they attained the Supreme Being: By his yogic accomplishment he created Marici, BhFgu, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu; Daksa, Atri and Vasistha. These nine sons of Brahma were the knowers of Brahman and excellent brahmins. They are known as expounders of brahman and were equal to Brahma himself:

12. [He had three more sons] Sankalpa, Dharma and Adharma. Adharma is always present near Dharma. Thus there were twelve progenies of Brahma of unknown origin.

13-14. The eternal lord had at the outset created Rbhu and Sanatkumara. These two eldest sons became the divine expounders of Brahman. Being free from sexual desire they remained bachelors and rose equal in wisdom to Brahma. They were omniscient and possessed of all merits. I shall now state succinctly the names of the wives of the brahmanical sages and the birth of their progenies, 0 excellent sages. Vairajni

15-17. The lord created Viraja (Manu) and Satarupa who was not born of womb: She bore two sons and two daughters to Manu: The elder was the intelligent Priyavrata and the younger Uttanapada: The elder daughter was Akuti and the younger was Prasuti:

18-26. Prajapati Ruci married Akuti and lord Daksa married Prasuti the mother of the worlds and great Yogini: Akuti gave birth to a son Yajia and a daughter Daksina. Daksa gave birth to twelve illustrious sons. Prasuti of great penance bore twenty-four daughters to Daksa viz,

At the beginning of the creation Brahma had created Being (Rudra) possessed of a body half man's and half woman's and then the Creator said, Divide thyself: And he being accosted thus, divided himself into two. It was then that she was born.

All the women in three worlds are born of the female part: Similarly, all the eleven Rudras originated from his male part:

Everything feminine in gender is she herself and everything masculine is Rudra himself. Keeping Rudra in view, lord Brahma looked at Daksa and said, (Worship her, she is of good holy rites, the mother of all the worlds, of mine as well as yours: If the word putri (daughter) is interpreted as 'one who.

The three were the sons of Svaha. Together with their sons and grandsons their number goes up to forty-nine (= 7 x 7). The fires are produced in sacrifices:

4. All these are ascetics and observers of holy rites: All of them are prajapatis identical with Rudra:

5. The Pitrs are of two categories: yajvans and non-yajvans: Yajvans are also called Agnisvattas, the non-yajvans as Barhisadas. Sraddha gave birth to the mental daughter Mena. This mental daughter is well known in the world.

6. Mena gave birth to Mainaka Kraufica, his (Mainaka's) younger sisters Uma and Ganga. The latter became the holiest by virtue of her contact with the body of lord Siva. Svadha gave birth to mental daughter Dharani (earth) who became the support of sacrifices: That lady (Dharani) of lotus-face became the wife of Meru, the king of mountains:

# Clon) Siva

Sati, the adopted child of Dakea, the future daughter of Himavat; married Rudra.

1L. Later, she cursed her father Daksa [and immolated herself]. Rudra who thought on her created many Rudras.

12. He created them in the form of his own person; they were honoured by all the worlds. At the behest of Brahma, lord Rudra created them. The lord had laughed and they were created immediately:

13-16. The fourteen worlds were completely covered by them. They were of different sort, devoid of impurities, deathless and ageless. On seeing these Rudras in front, Brahma spoke to them:

O Rudras, obeisance to you: O three-eyed gods, you are omniscient, omnipresent and splendid; Some of you are long, some short and dwarfish. Your hair are golden: You dazzle our eyes by your splendour: You are eternal, enlightened, devoid of impurities and dvandvas: You are passionless sons of Rudra: You are the universal souls. Thus, after eulogising Rudras, lord Brahma circumambulated them and spoke to Rudra:

17. "O lord; obeisance be to you; O great Rudra, it does not behove you to create subjects devoid of death: O lord, you should create mortal subjects." Rudra replied thus, "My position is not of such nature: O Brahma, you should create such subjects endowed with death.

18. Then the great lord of Rudra,

19. Thus, at the will of the four-faced Brahma created the Universe, of the mobile and immobile beings, endowed with death and old age, creating mortal.

20-24. Thus, as Rudra desisted from subjects he obtained the title 'sthanu'. O Brahmins, Rudra alone is capable of that: He is the supreme and unsullied soul who can assume physical bodies when he wills. The lord bestows happiness on all living beings mercifully and without strain: He has, therefore, acquired the title Sankara. He is the all-pervading.

30. The universe is comprised of fourteen worlds, seven rising above (ii) bbuveh, (iii) svar, (iv) maher, (v) janah (vi) tpu, (vii) ntyem.

The indiscriminate eschewal of this knowledge is meaningless and is contrary to the purpose: It is through his grace that the confluence of knowledge and detachment takes place:

25-26. Virtue, knowledge, detachment and prosperity are the result of his blessing; By taking recourse to him one can be easily liberated: Even if he is engrossed in sin he does not fall into hell: Hence, by resorting to him, people attain eternal release from worldly existence:

There are twenty-eight crores of hells from ghora tomaya where the sinners are tortured, if they do not seek refuge in Him: He is the support of all living beings: He is unchanging: He is the lord of the worlds. He is Purusa, the great Atman. He is often invoked and often culogiscd: He is named Kala Rudra when he assumes tamoguna, and Brahma when he assumes rajoguna and Vignu when he assumes sattvaguna.

The sages said

5. O best of yogins, if perfect knowledge comes through grace, you shall tell us about the form and feature as well as the divine yoga of lord Siva (through which that grace is attained).

6. How does the lord devoid of anxiety bestow his grace on men by means of the yogic path and at what time?

Sita said

7. May you all hear what had been formerly mentioned by Nandin to Sanat Kumara, the son of Brahma, in the presence of devas, sages, and pitrs.

9. In different areas, the four disciples of the lord, fully endowed with mental control, spread the doctrines of Siva: There grew up many disciples of disciples and the lord was pleased at this.

10. The perfect knowledge of the lord had been traditionally and gradually transmitted orally to men of the first three castes from brahmins to vaisyas in the manner befitting them: It was done so out of mercy.

They are innumerable in the various kalpas and the manvantaras: Since the incarnations of Rudras and Vyasas in the Kali age are too many, I shall recount the incarnations in the Vaivasvata manvantara, in the Varaha kalpa and in all the other manvantaras falling therein.

The sages said

# 21.

Suta, it behoves you now to recount the manvantaras in the Varaha kalpa and in all the later kalpas as also recount the Siddhas in the Vaivasvata manvantara.

Suta said

# 22-28.

The first Manu was (1) Svayambhuva son of Brahma. Then; O brahmins, was the Manu (2) Svarociga. The subsequent Manus were: (3) Uttama, (4) Tamasa, (5) Raivata, (6) Cakeusa, (7) Vaivasvata, (8) Savarni, (9) Dharma, (10) Savarnika, (11) Pisanga, (12) Apizangabha, (13) Sabala, and

Thus all the holy Manus have been mentioned by (1) name, (2) letters, and (3) colour: Those identical with the vowels are, in brief, mentioned as the leaders of the manvantaras. Among them, the seventh Manu is Vaivasvata represented by the vowel 'Sr' and colour black. This seventh Manu is also a leader among devas: I shall mention the yogins in this repeated cycle of yugas in the kalpas that have passed by and those that are yet to come:

29-35. The current kalpa in the seventh manvantara is known as Varaha. Now listen to the yogic incarnations of the lord and their line of disciples in due order, in all the kalpas and manvantaras. In the first Kali of Svayambhuva Manu they were:

2. The portion covered by a vitasti beneath the throat and above the umbilicus is the excellent zone of yoga; so also the curling lock of hair below the umbilicus and the middle portion between the eyebrows.

3. The knowledge of all topics that arises in the soul is called yoga. The concentration of the mind is possible only through his grace: O brahmins, the form of his grace can

4. O excellent be realized by the individual alone: It cannot be imported by Brahma or any other: It arises itself in the individual gradually.

5. Yoga indicates the region where the Supreme Lord dwells. For the attainment of that region, knowledge is the cause, and this knowledge comes through his grace alone.

6. One should abstain from sensual activities and burn sins by means of perfect knowledge: The achievement of yoga shall be possible only to one who has restrained the activities of his sense-organs.

7. O excellent brahmins, yoga is restraining the functioning of the mind. Eight means have been mentioned for the achievement of yoga.

8-9. They are (1) yama (restraint), (2) niyama (observances), (3) asana (a particular posture), (4) pranayama (restraint of breath), (5) pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses), (6) dharana (retention), (7) dhyana (meditation), and (8) samadhi (ecstatic trance) of austerity called.

# Lingopurdna

The contributory cause of restraint is non-violence (ahinsa), truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy and non-acceptance of gifts are the other causes. The root of niyama (observances of vows) is undoubtedly yama alone.

# 12.

Considering all living beings as one's own self and working for the welfare of all living beings is called non-violence. It helps in achieving the knowledge of self.

# 13.

Retelling precisely what has been seen, heard, inferred or experienced is called truthfulness (satya). It is devoid of injury or infliction of pain on others.

# 14.

The Vedas declare: "One should not utter what is obscene in the presence of the brahmins." Even after knowing the defects of others one should not proclaim them to others; this is another passage in the Sruti.

# 15.

Not stealing the possessions of others purposefully, even in emergency, mentally, physically and verbally is non-stealing. In brief: Not indulging in sexual intercourse, mentally, verbally or physically is the vow of celibacy, with reference to the ascetics and the religious students.

# 16.

This holds good in regard to the anchorites, forest-dwellers and widowers. I shall now tell you about the vow of celibacy of the householders who live with their wives.

# 17.

In their case, as prescribed, indulgence in sexual intercourse with their own wives and abstention from it with other women mentally, physically and verbally should be understood as brahmacarya: after indulging in sexual intercourse with his own wife.

# 18.

The householder shall take ablution. If he is in yogic communion with his self he is undoubtedly a celibate.

# 19.

In the case of non-violence (ahimsa) too, the same rule is applicable: Violence sanctioned by Sruti, in regard to the brahmanas, preceptors and sacrifice comes under ahimsa.

# 20.

Women are always to be avoided: One should stay.

# 37.

For eight kinds of maithuna, cf: ST. FTTT #a #a: Brahmacarya (celibacy) is defined as the reversal of maithuna (sexual indulgence) and it imparts vigour and force. Cf: TogasEto

# 22.

He should have the same attitude in the course with his own wife, as when discharging the faeces and urine on the ground: There should be no attitude other than this:

# 23.

Woman is like a burning coal; man is like a vessel of ghee: He should always avoid contact with women therefore:

# 24.

If we ponder over this, we shall know that there is no satiety in sexual pleasures. Hence; one should practice detached attitude mentally, physically and verbally.

# 25.

Lust is never suppressed by indulging in sexual pleasures. Just as fire burns vigorously if ghee is poured in, so also lust is increased by means of indulgence.

# 26.

Hence the yogin should always practice renunciation for achieving immortality, since he who is not detached is born and re-born in different wombs.

# 27.

The Vedas declare that it is only through renunciation that immortality is attained: O brahmins, the most excellent among the knowers of Sruti and Smrti, it is not possible through rites, through progeny or through offerings of materials of worship:

# 28.

Hence one should practice detachment, mentally, verbally and physically. Abstention from sexual intercourse; except during the prescribed period, after menstruation is stated as celibacy in the case of householders:

# 29-31.

Thus the restraints (yamas) are mentioned: I shall now tell you the observances (niyamas). They are ten in number (1) cleanliness (Sauca), (2) sacrifice (ijya), (3) penance (tapas), (4) charitable gift (dana), (5) study of the Vedas (svadhyaya), (6) restraint on the organs of generation (upasthanigraha), (7) holy rites (vrata), (8) fast (upavasa), (9) silence (mauna), and (10) holy bath (snana). According to some, observances (niyama) mean (1) absence of craving (anihi), (2) cleanliness (Sauca), (3) satisfaction (tusti), (4) penance (tapas), (5) muttering of Siva's mantra.

30 Lingopwana (japa), (6) meditation on Siva and (7) postures such as padmaka. Of these cleanliness is twofold (1) external and (2) internal. Of the two the internal is superior to the external, 32-35. One who has external cleanliness should practise internal cleanliness too. The holy bath should be conducted in accordance with the injunctions: It is threefold (1) Agneya (fiery), (2) Varuna (watery) and (3) Brihma (consisting of Brahman). It is only after he has practised the external bath that he should practise the internal: If he is devoid of internal purity, he is still dirty even if he applies clay over his body and plunges into the waters of the tirthas. O excellent brahmins, the moss, the fishes, the sharks and the animals that prey upon fishes remain ever in water. But are they pure? Internal cleanliness should always be pursued in accordance with the injunctions.

36. Internal cleanliness is mentioned as follows: One should apply the holy ashes of detachment with feeling of devotion: One should take a holy dip into the waters of knowledge of the soul. This is how one can attain purification.

37-39. Siddhis are accomplished only in a pure and not in an impure person: A person of holy rites who is satisfied with the sustenance he gets by justifiable means has the characteristics of saticty (tueti). He is not worried about his needs. Austerity is the right observance of the holy rites Candrayana, etc. Svadhyaya is the threefold repetition of Omkara mantra, i.e. (1) Vacika - oral utterance which is the basest of the three; (2) Upamsu - slow uttering which is better than Vacika; (3) Manasa - when the sound does not come out of the throat which is the best of all. This is stated in detail in the ritualistic text on the five-syllabled mantra:

40-43. Siva-pranidhana (contemplation of Siva) mentally, physically and verbally, unflinching devotion to the preceptor, withdrawal of the organs of sense from the objects of worldly pleasures - this in brief is called pratyahara (withdrawal). Dharana (retention) is the fixation of the mind in the proper place: Dhyana (meditation) comes through the normalcy of Dharana (retention). If it is coupled with thought, it is samadhi (ectatic trance). In samadhi there is concentration of the...

mind and meditation; herein the perception of object is entirely excluded:

44. In samadhi, the supreme consciousness alone shines, as though it were devoid of physical body: Pranayama (control of breath) is the root of dhyana, samadhi, etc:

45. The wind within the body is prana: Its restraint is yama. As stated by the Brahmins it is threefold: (1) slow (manda), (2) middling (madhya) and (3) uttama (superior).

46. The restraint of the prana and apana is called pranayama. The magnitude of the restraint of breath is stated to be twelve moments.

47-50. The slow (manda) consists of twelve moments which form one stroke or blow (udghata). The middling consists of two strokes: The superior has three strokes, i.e., thirty moments. The three respectively generate sweating, shivering and rising up. When the following symptoms are seen the pranayama is excellent, for it denotes the onset of bliss. The symptoms are reeling due to drowsiness, horripilation, sensation of hearing some sound, pressing of one's own limbs, shiverings.

4. Samadhi is a fixation of the mind on the personal soul (jiva), and further, of the personal soul on the supreme soul, so as to identify the contemplator with the object meditated upon. This is the eighth and best stage of yoga. Of. Hathayogapradipika.

With Buddhists it is the fourth and last stage of dhyana.

40. The time of matra is that of a winking and opening the eyelid once, or that of a protodial instant. The udghata pranayama extends during twelve matras or twelve protodial instants. It is defined in the Markandeya thus:

SP. defines mitra as a unit of time required for the snapping of the fingers after moving them round the knee neither speedily nor slowly (Veyavya 37.31).

4. For the Hathayogapradipika.

Vertigo born of sweating fixation, absence of knowledge and unconsciousness.

# 51-54.

Pranayama is of two types: sagarbha and agarbha. If it is pursued with japa, it is sagarbha; if without japa, it is agarbha. It is like an elephant, or an eight-footed animal Sarabha or a formidable lion. When caught and tamed properly it becomes submissive. Similarly, for the yogins, the wind which is by nature unstable and uncontrollable becomes normal and subservient by proper practice: Just as the lion or the elephant or the Sarabha, though ferocious, is tamed after a while with proper training, so also the wind attains normalcy and equanimity due to constant acquaintance and practice.

# 55-57.

He who practises yoga never suffers calamity: When the prana is properly trained it turns the defects of the mind, speech or body, preserving the body of the practiser. Thus, if the devotee perfects himself by taking recourse to the pranayama his defects perish; the very breath is conquered by him, and the divine quiescence etc. are achieved.

# 58-62.

The attributes of the pranayama are four, viz, Santi, pralanti, dipti and prasada: They are explained in order: O brahmins, the first of these four is Santi. It means the suppression of sins congenital or adventitious. Pralanti is perfect restraint in speech. All round, all time brilliance; O brahmins, is called dipti. Prasada is the clarity of the mind which is of four types. It is the clarity of the sense-organs, of the intellect and the organic winds. The organic winds - prana, apana, samana, udana and vyana have their functional names Naga, Kurma, Krkala, Devadatta and Dhananjaya respectively. The clarity of these winds is called prasada.

# 43.

According to ST, agarbha is a variety of Kumbhaka that includes puraka (inhaling) and recaka (exhaling) varieties of prapana. ST defines agarbha as the kind of prapana wherein the breath is retained without meditation and japa, and sagarbha as that wherein meditation and japa are allowed (Veaviya 37. 33, 34). Restricted speech: ST quotes from the Mahabharata.

63-67. The wind which traverses through the body is called prana; that which brings down food and drink is called apana; that which enables the limbs of the body to bend is called vyana which incites the ailments too; that which excites and afflicts the vulnerable points (in the body) is called udana. That which normalizes the functions of the organs is called samana. Thus the first set of five winds has been explained to you. The wind Naga functions in the act of belching; the Kurma in the opening of eyes; Krikala in sneezing; Devadatta in yawning and Dhananjaya in making loud report: It is present even in the dead body. By restraining these winds, one can attain prasada. O brahmins, in the fourfold set of attributes, prasada figures as the fourth. O brahmins, the intellect has these synonyms ~viz =

68-69. visvara, mahat; prajia, manas, brahma, citi, smrti, khyati, samvit; Isvara and mati. It is through pranayama that the clarity of intellect is achieved:

70-74. O excellent sages, Visvara is so called because it compromises between two conflicting opposites. Since it is the first and the greatest of all the tattvas arising out of Prakrti it is called mahat. It is called prajia because it is the repository of all means of knowledge. It is manas because it thinks. It is Brahmi because it is big and swells up. O most excellent among the knowers of Brahman, it is called citi because it gathers together all activities for the sake of enjoyment: It is called smrti because it enables one to remember things. Since it obtains everything it is called Samvit. Because it is known everywhere by means of knowledge it is called khyati.* It is called Isvara because it is the overlord of all elements and comprehends everything: O sages, most excellent among the intelligent; it is called Mati because it is the instrument of thought subjectively and objectively. It is called Buddhi because it enlightens things and is itself the instrument of enlightenment.

75. The perspicuity of this Buddhi is

45. khyiti ~a category of intellect (MP: 3.17). It is called so because it is the source of the perceived creation or the cosmos which become visible or the object of perception by the mind and the senses.

77. O excellent ascetics, one should increase the power of intellect by means of gamadhi. The eight ancillaries of yoga should be practised only after securing the proper place for yogic practice: the knower shall then duly secure Asanas (correct postures) for achieving yogic results. If the place and time are not suitable he cannot have even a glimpse of yoga.

78-86. The yogic exercises should not be practised in the following places or circumstances: near the fire, within water, on a heap of dry leaves, in a place infested with creatures, in the cremation ground, in a dilapidated cowpen, in the four crossroads, in a place full of noises, in a place generating fear, in a monastery, or the anthill in an inauspicious place, in a place inhabited by wicked men and in a place infested with mosquitoes. One should not practise yogic exercises when there is some ailment in the body or when the mind is in dejection.

The devotee shall delightedly practise the ancillaries of yoga in the following places: It should be a well-protected place, auspicious and pleasing; or a cave in a mountain or shrine of Siva, or a well-guarded park or forest; or a corner in one's own house devoid of people and animals. It should be scrupulously clean, well scrubbed, smeared with cowdung and rendered beautiful in diverse ways. It shall be spotlessly clean like the surface of a mirror. It shall be fumigated with black agallocum. Different kinds of flowers should be strewn all around: A canopy should adorn the whole place. It should be endowed with roots, fruits, tender sprouts, ku: a grass and variegated flowers.

Pleasures. Lethargy means abstention from work due to the bulkiness of the body and mind:

4. Ailments originate from the imbalance of the constituent elements: They are the outcome of the defective previous schemes as well as of bad habits. Negligence constitutes omission to secure the means of yoga.

5-6. Doubt is a double perception "this or that". Unsteadiness is the instability to stabilize the mind: The mind remains unsteady due to its engrossment in mundane affairs even when the ground is achieved. Lack of faith is the unemotional attitude towards the means of yoga:

7-9. Illusion is misconception of the mind as regards one's aim, the preceptor, right knowledge, good conduct and lord Siva as also in the apprehension of self in non-self even when it is nearby: Misery is threefold spiritual, material, and divine. There is also a natural misery due to the agitation of the mind through the frustration of desires:

10-12. When the mind is affected by tamas or rajas it is afflicted. The state of the mind at that time is called dejection: Dejection should be eschewed by strict detachment from the material objects: When one can discriminate between what is worthy and what is not worthy but still stubbornly clings to the unworthy, engrossed in diverse mundane affairs, his mind becomes fickle then. These are the impediments in the realization of yoga for yogin, who practices yoga excessively.

13-15. To the devotee endowed with zeal the obstacles subside but other impediments in the form of siddhis begin to appear: The siddhis are six.

52. Adhyatmika - this misery proceeds from bodily and mental causes within oneself. Cf. Visnu quoted in ST.

53. Adhibhautika - this misery is produced from external causes; ST.

54. Adhidaivika - this misery proceeds from the influence of the atmosphere or planets, from divine or supernatural agencies: ST.

(1) pratibha, (2) Sravana, (3) varta, (4) darsana, (5) asvada, and (6) vedana.

16. These siddhis if avoided initially when their potency is very little; lead to better results: Pratibha (keen intellect) is the disposition (of the mind), resting on one's power of understanding: is the faculty of discrimination by which anything knowable is known: If one has knowledge of things subtle or hidden far or near, past or future, at all times and places, that knowledge is called pratibha. If the yogin is able to grasp without effort, the import of all words by merely hearing concealed or indistinct syllables, whether short, long or prolonged that ability is called Sravana. The perception of touch without actual contact is called Vedana (awareness). The ability to see divine forms without effort is called darsana: Asvada (appreciation) is the ability to taste divine delicacies without strain.

21. Varta is the intellectual perception of divine smells and subtle elements. O brahmins, through yoga, the yogins attain the knowledge of everything about the embodied beings.

22-25. In this world there are sixty-four qualities present in the body. O brahmins, among these, the aupasargika qualities should be eschewed: In the region of pisacas, O brahmins, the qualities of earth should be eschewed; in the region of rakgasas the qualities of water; in the region of Yaksa the qualities of fire; in the region of Gandharvas the qualities of air; in the region of Indra the qualities of ether; in the region of Soma the qualities of breath; in the region of prajapati the qualities of mind; in the region of brahman the qualities of intellect should be eschewed.

26-29. In the first region (earth) there are eight qualities; in the second (water) sixteen; in the third (fire) twenty-four; in the fourth (gandharva) twenty-two; in the fifth (Indra) forty. Each of the five subtle elements—smell, taste, colour, touch and sound is evolved eightfold: O excellent brahmins, there are forty-eight qualities in the region of the moon, fifty-six in the region of Prajapati, and sixty-four in the region of Brahman.

When the lord is delighted liberation becomes easy to attain; by virtue of complete detachment: In some cases, sage (after getting His grace) may roam about without eschewing the Siddhis for the sake of blessing others or for mere sport: Then also he can be happy:

In some places leaving the Earth he may sport in the sky with splendour; in some places he may utter the Vedas or their subtle meanings succinctly; in some places he may compose verses based on the meaning of the Vedic passage; in some places he may compose poems in the Dandaka or other meters in thousand ways: He may obtain knowledge of the cries of beasts and birds: Everything beginning with Brahma and ending with the immobile beings may become perceptible to him like myrobalan fruit in the palm:

# CHAPTER TEN

# Means of Direct Perception

Sita said:

1-9. O great brahmins, lord Siva becomes delighted with all these persons: those who desire to be liberated, who have conquered self; the twice-born, the virtuous, who have attained sadhanas, the noble-souled, kind and merciful, the ascetics, who have renounced the world, who are detached and endowed with perfect knowledge, who have self-control; the three kinds of donors, who have subdued senses, who speak truth, who are liberal, endowed with yogic practice, conversant with srutis and smrtis and who do not come into clash with the sastric injunctions. The word 'sat' refers to the Brahman: Those who are likely to attain Brahma in the end are called liberated. They who are neither angry nor delighted in regard to the ten types of sensuous objects and eight types of means are called self-conquerors. The brahmins, kshatriyas and vaishyas are called twice-born because they have special consecratory rites. The virtuous is the One who has acquired the knowledge of dharma explained in Sruti and smrti which is proper for different castes and stages of life and which brings about happiness in heaven and other worlds. One who acquires learning by serving his preceptor is a sadhu (among the religious students). The householder is also sadhu when he performs holy rites (ordained for him). The forest-dweller becomes a sadhu when he achieves penances; striving ascetic.

10. The sadhu is called sadhu when he achieves yogic power. Thus the persons who achieve Dharma relating to ashramas or the various stages of life are called sidhus.

11-13. The persons in the different stages of life are the religious student, the householder, the forest dweller and the ascetic. The two words Dharma and Adharma mentioned here...

58. ...determine vigayc, objects that can be accomplished through ten organs of sense, i.e. five organs of action and five organs of knowledge.

59. This group of eight is explained in the preceding chapter.

Lingapurana

Auspicious activities constitute Dharma and inauspicious activities Adharma. The word Dharma is explained as that which is great in the task of Dharana (holding up or uplifting) and Adharma (its opposite) as not holding up. In this context, Dharma is instructed by the preceptors as one that takes to what is desired.

14-16. Adharma, as taught by the preceptors, is one that has its fruit what is not desired. They call those persons Acaryas (preceptors) who are elderly, not greedy and self-possessed; devoid of arrogance, well disciplined, and straightforward. He who practices (Dharma) himself, who establishes others in Dharma and who gathers together the meanings of the scriptural texts is called Acarya. What should be known or what is worthy of knowledge is Srauta if it is heard and Smarta if it is remembered.

17-21. A sacrifice when it pertains to Vedas is called Srauta, and when it pertains to the varnasramas is called Smarta. One who has found truth and does not hide it when asked for, is called an Acarya. Truth, as defined in this purana, is the statement of facts exactly in the manner seen. Tapas (penance) constitutes celibacy, silence, observance of fast, abstention from injury of all sorts and quiescence. When a person behaves towards all living beings like unto himself, both for welfare or otherwise, that attitude is called kindness. Whatever one has obtained by justifiable means, whatever one likes the most, should be given to a meritorious person; this is the characteristic feature of the charitable gift of the donor.

Charitable gift is of three types viz: - the lowliest, the highest and the middling.

22-27. The sharing (of possessions) with all beings, out of sympathy is the charitable gift of the middling order. The rites laid down by Srutis and Smrtis in regard to persons of different stages in life and castes constitute Dharma. Dharma that does not come into clash with the conduct of the persons of disciplined life is held to be righteous.

That person is glorified as one of the auspicious souls who eschews the fruits of his illusive activities. One who has refrained from all attachments is glorified as this ethical code places this cult at par with universal religion.

# Direct Perception

Yogin. He who ponders over the risks involved in sensual pleasures and remains unattached to them even though pressed importunately from all round is called self-controlled.

The characteristic feature of perfect control constitutes the fact that sense organs do not function falsely or improperly whether for one's sake or for others.

The following is the detached state: The person is not excited when calamities occur nor is he overjoyed when he has pleasant results. Absolute cessation of joyousness, affliction and despondency is detachment: Renunciation of the fruits of all activities committed or omitted is called Sannyasa.

28-31. The eschewal of both joy and misery is called Nyasa. All created things from the unmanifest to the manifest gross elements are insentient: Perfect Knowledge is the discrimination between the sentient and the insentient: Lord Siva, no doubt, bestows his grace on him who is endowed with such perfect knowledge: So also dharma bestows grace: Yet I shall tell you a great secret: One who is endowed with devotion to the lord is undoubtedly liberated: It is certain that lord Siva checks the different sorts of delusion of the devotee and is delighted with him even if he (the devotee) lacks full accomplishments for yoga.

32-37. Perfect knowledge; teaching of the Vedas, offerings to the gods, meditation, sacrifices, penance, charitable gifts, study of the Vedas, all these undoubtedly contribute to the devotion of Lord Siva. O excellent sages, devotion results from thousands of Prajapatyas; hundreds of Candrayanas, monthly fasts and other holy rites. Those who lack in devotion to the lord fall into mountain cave and undergo the results.

O brahmins, there is no doubt in this that heavenly pleasures are not difficult of access even to ordinary men, by the mere sight of the devotee; what doubt then in regard to the devotee: It is only through devotion that Brahma, Visnu, gods, sages, and others stabilise themselves and attain strength and fortune. This has been stated by the lord himself while addressing Uma,

O brahmins, these words were spoken by the lord to the goddess Uma at Varanasi, in the Avimuktaka region while the lord was sitting with her, she addressed him thus: "O great lord how can you be realised and worshipped? O Lord, tell me, is it by penance, or learning, or yoga?"

O splendid lady, in the Sveta kalpa, Brahma saw me in the white colour as Sadyojata; in the Rakta kalpa in the red colour as Vamadeva; in the Pitakalpa in the yellow colour as Tatpurusa; in the Aghora-kalpa in the black colour as Isvara; in the Visvarupa kalpa as the multi-coloured Isana.

The lord said to the goddess, 'I said then to Brahma, 'O lotus-born one, I can be controlled by faith alone. I am to be meditated upon in the Linga which both you and Vignu beheld in the ocean. I am to be adored by the twice-born in the form of the five-faced deity with the five-syllabled mantra: O preceptor of the universe; born of the cosmic egg, I have been seen by you today by virtue of your devotion to me: He (Brahma) then asked me to create in him feeling of further devotion which I readily granted. O goddess, with that increased devotion he saw me clearly in his heart. I declare that I am subject to control by means of devotion alone I can indeed be seen thereby, O daughter of the Himalaya. And, indeed, I am always to be worshipped in the linga by the brahmins full of faith. Faith is the greatest and the subtlest virtue.

On seeing that Puruga, the glorious Lord Brahma with faces all around, thought of the noble-souled lord in the form of Brahman: Brahma retained Sadyojata in the heart and became engaged in meditation. After realizing the greatest being through meditation, Brahma, the lord of Devas, saluted him.

6-7. Brahma contemplated again over Sadyojata. Thereupon from his sides were born Svetas (white ones) of great fame, viz. Sunandae, Nandana, Visvananda, and Upanandana; these noble-souled ones were the disciples of Brahma by whom he was always surrounded: Sveta.

8. In front of him, the sage glittering in his white colour was born: Then there was born Hara of great splendour.

Their faces and hair were all yellow. For a period of thousand years, these persons of great power and splendour who were devoid of impurities spent their time for the welfare of brahmins. They were yogic souls delighting in penances. They were endowed with virtue and power of yoga. They instructed the sages engaged in long sacrifices in the system of great yoga and (finally) entered the body of the lord.

To this mixture, water taken with a tuft of kusa grass should be added by repeating the mantra Devasya tva, and the mixture should be well stirred in a vessel made of gold, silver or copper, or in a cup made of lotus or palasa while reciting the aghora mantra. In this vessel, he should place kalka, along with a different gem and a piece of gold tuft of kuba grass.

He should perform homa, seven times separately with each one of these materials. If the materials are not available he should perform homa with ghee alone: O brahmins, he should perform homas as well as ablution for the lord with ghee while repeating the Aghora Mantra: He should bathe the lord with eight drona measures of ghee and wipe it off. He should then observe a fast for the whole day and night, take a holy bath and drink kurca before the image of Siva. After performing the rite of acamana he should repeat Gayatri:

Then Sarasvati of universal form and loud sound manifested herself: The universe constituted her garlands, garments, sacred thread and turban: The mother of the universe with all universal scents and long lips manifested herself. Brahma meditated on lord Isana resembling pure crystal and bedecked in all ornaments.

Then Brahma who bowed to the delighted Rudra said with delighted mind in clear words: know O lord, I wish to see this universal form of Yours: Here is the universal Goddess of welfare: Who is she possessed of four feet; four faces, four horns, four mouths, four curved fangs, four udders; four bands and four eyes?

How did Linga originate? How should the lord be propitiated in Linga? What is this Linga? What is its substratum? O Suta, you should narrate all this to us.

Brahma said:

O excellent Devas; it was for us both, Vishnu and myself, that Linga manifested itself in the ocean: It was when the aerial charioteers had gone to the Janaloka together with the Sages and when the period of sustenance being over, the creation was withdrawn and when at the end of a thousand sets of four yugas, they had gone to Satyaloka and in the end, except their overlords, had attained identity with me, then all...

immobile beings had dried up due to all-round drought and other beings like men, animals, Pisacas, Rakzasas, Gandharvas including plant life were scorched to death by the rays of the Sun. Everything was a single vast sheet of water: It was terribly dark all round: In that vast sheet of water, the lord devoid of impurities and free from calamities had gone to sleep. He had a thousand heads, a thousand eyes; a thousand feet and a thousand arms. He, the universal soul, omniscient, the source of origin of all, was characterized by the qualities of rajas, tamas and sattva in the form of Brahma, Rudra and Vishnu: He was omnipresent and the supreme lord in view of his being the soul of all: He was in the form of Kala with Kala in his umbilicus. He was white, black, pure, of huge arms, the soul of all and identical with Being and non-Being:

On seeing the lotus-eyed deity lying thus, I was deluded by his maya. I asked him angrily:

Who are you? Tell me: Then with my hand I raised up the eternal lord: Due to the severe and firm blow of my hands he woke up from sleep and sat in his serpent couch. Within a moment he regained control of himself and with his lotus-like bleary eyes he looked at me:

Enveloped that he was by a halo of brilliance he spoke to me as I stood before him: He got up from bed and laughing awhile addressed me sweetly - of great brilliance. O leading Devas, when I heard his words uttered smilingly my arrogance was provoked by rajas and I spoke to him thus: "With smiles within, you call me by the appellation 'Dear' (as if I were inferior to you) - But know that I am the cause of creation and annihilation of the universe.

You are born of my eternal body: You forget that I am the lord of the Universe, the Supreme soul invoked and eulogised: I am Vishnu; Acyuta, Isana, the origin of the universe: It is not your fault that you have forgotten me; This has been effected by me through my maya. Listen to the truth, O four-faced deity: Indeed, I am the lord of all devas: I am the creator, leader and destroyer: There is no other lord like me. I alone am the Supreme Brahman: O Brahma, I am the greatest principle, the greatest luminary: the supreme soul. O four-faced lord, whatever is seen or heard in this universe—the mobile and immobile—is identical with me and permeated by me. Formerly the unmanifest pradhana, the twenty-fourth principle, from the gross to the indestructible atom was created by me: Out of fury were Rudra and others created: Out of joy and sport you were born as also the Cosmos: Intellect; the threefold ego, subtle elements, sense-organs including the mind; and gross elements were also created by me: terrible, thrilling fight ensued between us.

It was victorious, firm and incomparable: Assuming this form of black boar, Vishnu went lower and lower, hurriedly, for a period of one thousand years.
5. Still he could not reach the root of the Linga: O destroyer of enemies, throughout that period of time I was going higher and higher:
6. I hurried up my efforts to see the end of that Linga. I was tired. Arrogant that I was, I could not see the end and returned to the place of my start:
7. Similarly, Lord Vishnu was also tired: His fear was evident in his eyes. He, the origin of all Devas, immediately came up there:
8. We bowed to Lord Shiva. The noble-minded Vishnu was deluded by Shiva's Maya and he stood there in mental dejection:
9. We bowed to Lord Shiva at the sides, behind and in front and wondered what that was.
10. O great Devas then a loud sound "Om" issued (out of the column) It was clearly a prolated sound.

50-51. Thinking what it could be; Vienu stood there together with me: Then he saw the eternal first letter sa on the right band tide of the Linga; then on the left the letter u'; thereafter, the letter m in the middle and the vibratory tone in the end: That tone was Om.

52-55. Vimpu saw the first syllable ta' in the south, like the disc of the sun, the second syllable u as refulgent as fire in the north; the third m in the middle as refulgent as the sphere of the moon; above it, he saw the lord like the pure crystal: It was the fourth entity; devoid of attributes, nectarine, unsullied, undisturbed, devoid of mutually clashing opposites, unique; void, without an exterior or interior but still endowed with exterior and interior; as it was stationed both without and within: It was devoid of beginning, middle and end, it was the cause of bliss: called nada.

56-62. The three matras and half a matra together constitute Brahman. The three Vedas Rk, Yajus and Saman are in the form of the three matras. Visnu contemplated on Sive, the universal soul, through the words of the Vedas. The Vedas became sage. Vienu understood the glorious essence of the Vedas—the supreme lord through that sage alone:

Brahma said: Rudra is free from anxieties and worries: Speech recedes along with the mind being unable to attain him. He is expressible through the single syllable (om)8, which is the Divine order, the supreme cause, truth, bliss, nectar, the supreme Brahman; greater than the greatest: Out of that single syllable om, the syllable a is Brahma; u is Vispu, and m is Rudra. sa is the cause of creation, u of illusion and m of bliss.

63-65. The syllable m' is the sower, a' is the seed and u is the womb. The three symbolize the lord, Pradhana and Purusa. Thus the sower, the seed and the womb, together with nada;

82. Om is a symbol of Brahma. Cf: TogasOtra "tsye vacakah pra: pavah." In later times it came to represent the Hindu triad, viz: a (Vigpu), u (Sivo), m (Brahma): But this order is not followed in Puranas. For instance; according to Linga, m' represents Brahma, u' Vigpu and 0.

67-68.          Then atthe end of a thousand ycars the c88 that had evolved out of the unborn and stationed in the watcr was split into two by the   primeval   lord himsclf:          The   splendid golden skull of thc Eg8 became heaven and the base became the earth:                                       born.

69. From thc egg the four-faced Brahma was               Hc is the creator of the universc, the lord of three forms.

70-72_  The wise exponents of Yajus say that Om is Brab-man. The Rk and Saman Srutis too have declared similarly. On the lord of Devas precisely we meditated and we culogised him ting  Vedic mantras.   Delighted by               eulogy by   recie         the                              our              thc unsullied lord            delightfully stationcd himself into  thc divinc Linga after assuming the form of sund.

73-82.    The letter 'a' was his head; '' the forchead;      the right eye; '' the left eye; 'u' the right ear; @ thc left car '' the right cheek; f the left cheek, %r' and '7' thez     of his nostrils; 'e the upperlip; 'ai' thc lowerlip;    pairs s0' and 'au' thc two rows of tecth; 'am' and 'ah' the palates; the five letters beginning        with '' his five hands on the right side; the five letters   beginning with %c" his five hands on the left gide; the fve lettera begin- ning with %' his right leg; the five letters beginning with St' his left leg; thc letter  *p' his belly; Sph his right side, %' his lcft side; %h' his shoulder, 'm' his heart; the letters %y' to Ss'       tbc seven dhatus; 'h' his soul and 'k;'         his anger.

1. The Supreme Lord said 0 excellent among the Devas, I am delighted with you: On beholding me; the great lord, you should cast off all fear.

2-3. Both of you very powerful were born of me formerly. Brahma, the grandfather of the universe was born from my right side; Visnu, the soul of the universe, sprang from my left side: I am extremely pleased with both of you: I shall grant you the boon of your choice:

4. After saying this, the lord, the storehouse of mercy patted Visnu with his gentle and smooth hands out of compassion.

5. Then with a delightful mind, Visnu bowed to the great lord who though devoid of Linga spoke was stationed in the Linga.

6. If love has been generated in you, if boon has to be granted to us, may our devotion to you remain perpetual and unswerving: lord accordingly granted.

7. O Devas: the moon-crested lord granted them an unswerving devotion and faith.

8. Then Visnu knelt on the ground and bowed to the lord, with perfect control over himself he spoke to the lord in low tones.

9. O lord of the Devas, our controversy has borne splendid fruits, since you yourself have come over here to remove the same; hearing this, Lord Siva again spoke smiling to Visnu who bowed to him with his head bent down and who stood with palms joined in reverence:

Then you will see me thus, so will the lotus-born Brahma too. Thus saying the lord vanished there itself:

Ever since then the worship of the Linga was well established in the world: The great goddess is the altar for the Linga. The Linga is the great lord himself:

Linga is so called because; O gods, everything gets dissolved in it. The brahmin who reads this narrative of Linga, in the presence of the Linga image attaining Siva-hood: No doubt need be entertained in this respect:

# CHAPTER TWENTY

# The enlightenment of Brahma

The sages said

How did Brahma become the lotus-born (deity) formerly, in the Padmakalpa? How did Visnu and Brahma see lord Siva? Please recount all this particularly now.

Sita said: It was one vast sheet of water, terrible, undivided and full of darkness. In the middle of that vast sheet lay Lord Visnu holding the conch, discus and the iron club. He had the lustre of the cloud: His eyes resembled the lotus: He wore the coronet. He was known as Hari, lord of Sri, Narayana and Purusottama. From his mouth emerged all souls, all beings: He had eight arms and a large chest; He, the source of origin of the universe, the yogic atman, the knower of the yoga, adopted an inconceivable yoga and occupied the lofty body of the supreme lord in his qualified (ratal) state characterized by three functions viz. creation, sustenance and destruction. The idea is often repeated in the Puranas.

A huge serpent that had a thousand hoods and whose splendour was incomparable: In that vast sheet of water, the lord Jay on that great couch of serpent;

# 7-8.

A tall and lofty lotus was sportively created in his umbilicus as he lay there all-powerful self-contented but unwearied in activities: It was hundred Yojanas long: It resembled the mid-day sun. It had an adamantine stalk:

# 9-11.

Even as the bountiful lord was playing (with the lotus) = Brahma, who was born of the cosmic Egg of golden womb, who had golden colour, who was beyond the pale of the sense-organs, who had four faces and large eyes came near the lord casually: On seeing Visnu of splendid eyes sporting with the lotus that was glorious, divine, splendid and fragrant, Brahma was surprised and asked in a tone filled with gentleness:

(Who are you lying (here) in the middle of the waters?"

# 12-16.

On hearing the splendid words of Brahma, Visnu got up from his couch and with his eyes beaming with surprise replied:

"In every kalpa this is my shelter and asylum: What had been done, whatever is being done and what would be done (everything is done here itself) _ The heavens, the atmosphere and the earth everything is my region.

After saying thus, lord Visnu addressed him: "Who again are you? Whence do you come near me? Where do you intend to go? Where is your abode? Who are you that have the universe for your physical body? What can I do for you?"

# 17-24.

Thereupon Brahma replied to Visnu: Being deluded by the Maya of lord Siva, he could not fully comprehend Visnu who himself was deluded by the Maya of Siva and hence unknowable:

Brahma said: "Just like you I too am the Prajapati, the primordial creator:" On hearing with wonder the words of Brahma the creator of the worlds and on being permitted by him, the great yogin, Visnu entered through the mouth of Brahma, out of curiosity. Within the belly of Brahma he saw

the eighteen continents together with the oceans and mountains. On entering the belly of Brahma, Visnu of great splendor and brawny arms saw the eternal seven worlds up to the column of Brahma in which the people of the four castes stayed. Then uttering repeatedly, "How powerful is his penance," he wandered through different worlds of diverse creation. Though he wandered for a thousand years, he could not reach the end. Then he (Visnu), the support of the worlds who had Sesa the lord of snakes as his bed, came out of Brahma's mouth, and addressed him thus:

25. "O sinless one, You are the beginning, the end and the middle of the universe: You are Time; the quarters and the ether: O sinless one, I do not perceive the limits of your belly." After saying thus, Visnu spoke to Brahma again:

26-28. "In the same manner as You, I also am a lord. O illustrious one, please enter my belly and see the wonderful worlds therein." On hearing these pleasant words of Visnu, Brahma of truthful exploits approved of them and entered his belly. Then he saw those very worlds stationed in his womb.

29-30. He roamed about therein but he could not find the end. Then on observing the movement of Brahma, lord Visnu closed the openings of the passage and slept a perfect sleep. On seeing the openings closed, Brahma assumed subtle form and found an opening in the umbilicus.

89. Dvipe in the broader sense signifies a continental division of the terrestrial world: The number of such divisions varies according to different authorities being four, seven, nine, thirteen or eighteen. According to the Puranic tradition, dvipas are situated round the mountain Meru like the petals of a lotus flower and separated from one another by a distinct ocean. In the restricted sense, dvipa is land enclosed between two rivers (mod: doab): The word 'dvipa' is used in both these senses in the Puranas.

90. Seven regions. Cf. 1.23.53-54. The three Bhu, Bhuva and Svah are separated from the four higher regions Mahas, Jana, Tapa and Satya by mountain Lokaloka. The light of the luminaries illumines the three worlds but fails to reach the four higher regions.

91. Caturvarnya. The concept of fourfold social organization is already found in the RV. (x.90.12). The idea is developed in the Puranas. Veye (Ch.9) speaks of the cosmic origin of society (119-114; 199-140). Siva is the originator, Manu the founder and Bali the propagator of Varna (Ibid. 1.30.918; 59, 35-36; 61-98, 95-32).

31. Then the four-faced Brahma came out of the stalk of the lotus and assumed his own form:

32. The Self-born Brahma, the source of the origin of the universe sat in the lotus; resembling in lustre the interior of the lotus itself:

33-37. In the meantime, even as either of them was wholly engaged in struggle with the other in the middle of the ocean, lord Siva of immeasurable soul, the lord of living beings appeared there itself: Holding a trident in hand and clad in garments of pure gold he came to the place where Visnu was lying on Sesa - the lord of serpents. As he waded through the waters quickly, big drops of water rose up in the sky, kicked up by his feet: The wind that blew was very hot and cold: On perceiving this wonderful phenomenon; Brahma spoke to Visnu: "See how hot and cold waters make the lotus shake:

38-40. Clear this doubt of mine and tell me what else you wish to do now.

On hearing these words uttered by lord Visnu, the destroyer of Asuras and of unequalled exploits meditated thus: "What? Who is this great being occupying my umbilicus? He speaks pleasing words though I have been angry with him:" After thinking thus, Visnu spoke in reply:

41-48. "O Sir, are you in a perplexed state inside the lotus? O lord; what is it that I have done wherefore O excellent one among men, you speak to me thus? What is it for? Tell me factually: Lord Brahma, the storehouse of the Vedas, replied to the lotus-eyed lord of Devas who spoke thus in accordance with the activities of the world: It was I who formerly entered your belly in accordance with your wish: Just as all the worlds within my belly were seen by you O lord, so also all the worlds in your belly are seen by me: O sinless One after a thousand years I returned: With spirit of rivalry and a desire to subject me to control; all the openings were closed suddenly by you: O blessed one, I pondered over it: By dint of my own splendour I gained exit through the umbilicus by the lotus stalk. Let there be no dejection in your mind O Visnu; this is the sequence of events in their gradual advancement. What should be done by me hereafter, kindly tell me. What shall I do?"

Enlightenment %f Brahma
49-51. On hearing these loving, pleasing auspicious and irreproachable words of Brahma, Visnu the destroyer of Hiranyakasipu and of immeasurable soul, spoke sincere and simple words. This type of adverse action was not envisaged by me: I closed all the openings sportively and casually out of a desire for enlightening you: mis-understand me. You deserve my respect and worship. O auspicious one; forgive if at all I have committed any offence against you. O lord, descend from this lotus.

52. You are borne by me, lotus. I cannot bear you. You are refulgent and weighty. Thereupon Brahma said once again: 'Tell me, what boon you desire to have: O lord, take me down from the lotus'. Then Visnu said: 'O slayer of enemies, you should be my son. You will attain splendid pleasure: Speak agreeable and loving words. O lord, descend from the lotus. You are great yogin: You are worthy of our worship. You are the Pranava itself: Henceforth you will be the lord of all; adorned with a white turban you will be known as 'padmayoni' one whose source of origin is lotus: O Brahma, O lord, as son to me; you will be the overlord of seven worlds.'

Thus the lord granted him the boon and Brahma accepted the same cheerfully and spitelessly. Just then on seeing the miraculous, huge-faced Siva with the lustre of the rising sun, Brahma said to Visnu:

59-62. So Visnu, who is this incomprehensible person with a huge face and curved fangs? With hairs dishevelled; with ten arms stretched and holding trident; with all-round eyes he seems to be the lord of the universe: He has a deformed body and girdle of Munja grass. With huge splendour and roaring loudly and terribly, he has enveloped the quarters and the firmament: He comes this way itself:

On being addressed thus by Brahma, lord Vignu replied as follows:

92. The Purapas describe the golden lotus flower of one thousand petals sprung up from the navel of Vignu while he lay recumbent in the ocean. Cf. Matsya 168.15. According to Harivamsha (Bhagavata-parva, chs. 7-14) the golden lotus became the seat of Brahma and eko his birth-place. Hence Brahma is called padmayoni.

63-66. "He is wading through the ocean with great speed. When his feet press the surface of water, as he wades through the ocean with great speed, masses of water rise up even to the sky. O lotus-born one, you are being sprinkled from all sides with a heap of water. By the wind coming out of his nostrils, this great lotus emerged out of my navel is being shaken. It is lord Siva who has no origin and who destroys the world that has come: Let us eulogise the bull-horned lord with hymns of prayer;

67-68. Then Brahma who was infuriated spoke to Vishnu whose eyes resembled the lotus: Indeed you do not know yourself as the lord of all the worlds. You do not know me also as Brahma, the eternal creator of the worlds: Who is this Siva apart from us both?"

69-73. On hearing these words of Brahma uttered in rage, Vishnu spoke: "O auspicious one, bestower of welfare; do not speak ill of the great soul: Here is he who has the lustre of the splendid yoga, who is the invincible bestower of boons, who is the unchanging ancient Purusa, the cause of this universe: He is the sower of seeds and the refulgence of seeds, shining by himself: He, the lord, plays with toys as do the children. Pratlhana, the eternal womb, the unmanifest Prakrti and the quality tamas - darkness - these are my names, since I perpetually give birth to creation. The person of your query is lord Siva who is the goal of the ascetics who, being afraid of the pangs of birth and death resort to him: He is the sower of the seed; you are the seed itself and I am the eternal womb." On being addressed thus, Brahma, the soul of the universe asked again:

74. "How is it that You are the womb, I am the seed and he..."

93. According to the Purāṇic account of creation (uarga), in the beginning, the Cosmic Egg which arose out of the waters was insentient. It remained in that state for thousands of years until it was activated by the sentient principle which entering divided it into two parts. One of the two halves became the celestial and the other the terrestrial sphere. The creation is traced to the seed, personified as Brahma, deposited in the foetus personified as Vishnu, by Siva the sower of the seed: In fact; both the insentient egg and the sentient principle that activated it belong to Siva himself who out of sheer will and expertly too, create, dissolve and recreate and re-dissolve the universe.

# Enlightenment of Brahma

(lord Siva) the sower: This is a puzzle which you alone can solve. After thinking about creation, the multiformed living being there is no other greater than him. He is a great mystery, the dimensional abode of intellect and the coveted goal of spiritualists. He split himself into two. His unqualitative part remained unmanifest; the qualitative one came into appearance: Of him who was aware of activities of Prakrti and who was inaccessible and fathomless, the seed was born; formerly, at the first creation. This seed was laid into my womb which, after the lapse of some time, grew into a golden egg in the ocean.

For a thousand years the Egg lay in the waters: Thereafter it was split into two by the force of the wind:

The upper lid of the Egg became the heaven and the lower lid became the earth. The foetus became the lofty golden mountain Meru. Then with the soul entering the womb, you, the lord, Hiranyagarbha the most excellent of the lords of Devas, and of four faces were born.

On seeing that the world with stars, sun and moon, was void you meditated. Then the kumaras were born to you: Pleasing to look at, they became ascetics, the predecessors of yatis: Thus at the end of thousand years they were born as your sons.

They resembled the terrestrial fire in brilliance: They had eyes large as the petals of lotus. Sanat and Rbhu remained celibate having sublimated sexuality; the other three were Sanaka, Sanatana and Sanandana who were born simultaneously and who could visualize things even beyond the scope of sense-organs. They possessed great intellect; they were the cause of the sustenance of the worlds. They were devoid of the three types of miseries and they desisted from worldly activities: Seeing that life and death in the world yield but little pleasure, that it is attended with great strain and pain, that births and deaths recur again and again, that there is little.

pleasure in heaven, that miseries abound in hell, knowing the Sastraic injunctions about the inevitability of the future as also that Rbhu and Sanat were under your control, the three Sanaka, Sanatana and Sanandana of great prowess eschewed the three gunas and took to spiritual life.

91-94. Thus in the functioning of the kalpa, when the three sons Sanaka and others took to detachment you will become confused and deluded through the illusory power of lord Siva. Then O sinless one, your consciousness will perish: In the present kalpa, the elements both gross and subtle will be affected by his maya who, in fact, is the activizer of these elements. This great and glorious account of the most excellent of all Devas is as famous as the golden Meru—the mountainous abode of Devas.

95-97. Knowing him as the great lord and knowing me as the lotus-eyed Visnu, knowing also that the lord is the greatest of all living beings, the bestower of boons and the preceptor of the universe, you should bow to him, uttering the pranava (onkara) mantra and the Saman verses. If he is infuriated he will burn us both by his very breath: After realizing the lord of great strength and yoga, I shall keep you in front and eulogize him who is of fiery and dazzling splendour.

You are unfathomable and favourably disposed towards the Brahmins; you are adored by the society.

You have made sacrifice the everlasting treasure of the Devas. The fire-god bears to you the offering, as mentioned in the Vedas. O supreme lord, if you are pleased we too become pleased.

Be auspicious towards us everywhere: As you are, so you are; obeisance be to you.

Sqta said:

He who recites this prayer by Brahma and Visnu, he who narrates this to the brahmins, or he who listens to this with concentration shall obtain that benefit which one attains after performing ten thousand horse sacrifices. Even a man of sinful activity who listens to this in the temple of Siva or respects this will be liberated and will live in Brahma's world. He who recites this at the time of Sraddha or divine rite or during sacrifice or during the sacred ablution or in the midst of good men reaches the proximity of Brahma.

# CHAPTER TWENTY TWO

# Creation of Rudras

Sqta said:

1-2. On seeing both of them extremely humble, the lord of Uma with eyes tawny as honey, was much delighted, thanks to the exposition of truth: The three-eyed, the pinaka-bearing, and the trident-holder lord Siva, the destroyer of Daksa's sacrifice became very glad:

3. On hearing their nectar-like words lord Siva sportingly asked them though he knew their intentions:

4-7. (Who are you noble souls eagerly yearning for each other's welfare? You lotus-eyed ones have somehow met together in this terribly extensive flood. Glancing at each other, the noble souls replied: 'O lord, what is there that remains unknown to you? O lord Rudra of great 'Maya', We two have been created by you willingly:')

On hearing their words and having honoured and greeted them the glorious lord spoke sweetly in smooth words:

So Brahma, O Visnu, I am speaking to You.

8. I am delighted by your devotion couched in words of perpetual value: Both of you are endearing to my heart:

9. What shall I give you now? Which is sweeter boon you desire?" Then the blessed lord Vignu spoke to lord Siva.

# Creation of Rudras

10. O lord, everything has been granted by you. If you are so pleased with me, O lord, grant that my devotion for you remains stable.

11. On being requested thus, lord Siva realized it. He honoured Visnu and granted him devotion to his lotus-feet:

12. (You are the creator of this world. You are its presiding deity. Hail unto you, O dear, O lotus-eyed lord, I shall go (now) ...

13-15. After saying this, the great lord blessed Brahma too. Greatly delighted, he patted Brahma with his auspicious hands and said: O dear, surely you are equal to me. You are my devotee too. Hail unto you: I shall leave now, O deity of good rites, may there be perfect awareness in you.

16-17. After saying this, the lord of the Ganas, bowed to by all Devas, vanished there itself: After attaining perfect knowledge from Visnu, Brahma, whose source of origin was the lotus, performed terrible penance with desire to create. Even as he performed this penance, nothing resulted.

18. After a great deal of time, his misery turned into anger. From the eyes overwhelmed with anger, drops of tears fell down: drops huge and poisonous.

19-20. From those of tears, snakes appeared: They had all the three humours, the wind, bile and phlegm: They were highly blessed; they were adorned with Svastika marks. Their hairs were dishevelled and scattered. On seeing the snakes born at the outset, Brahma censured himself:

21. O fie upon the fruit of my penance of this sort, if it were to be like this. Even in the beginning, my progeny has become the destroyer of the world: fury.

22. Originating from anger and a severe loss of sense overwhelmed him. Out of the distress resulting from his loss of sense, he lost his life, of Brahma of unequalled valour.

23. From the body, the eleven Rudras sprang up crying; out of sympathy and mercy.

95. The word Rudra is derivable from Vru to cry and Vdru to move: The Puranas make frequent reference to the crying of Rudras. SP. (Vbaviya 12. 25-30) identifies Rudras with the life principles, i.e., the pranas that activate the insentient matter for creation. Asson &#x26; Rudra or Prana become.

24. They became known as Rudras due to their crying: The Rudras and the pranas are identical with each other.

25-28. The pranas are stationed in all living beings. The trident-bearing lord Siva who enforces strict discipline granted him life again. After obtaining life, lord Brahma saluted lord Siva, the lord of Devas. By means of Gayatri he perceived him as identical with the universe: On seeing and eulogizing him as such, Brahma was struck with wonder. Bowing to him again and again, he proclaimed: "O lord, how is it that you have assumed such forms as Sadyojata and others."

# CHAPTER TWENTY THREE

# Various Kalpas

Sita said:

1. On hearing the words of Brahma, lord Siva in the form of Brahman spoke to him smilingly, in order to enlighten him: "When the Sveta kalpa was current; it was I who existed then. I had a white turban, white garlands and white garments: I was white myself with white bones, white hairs, white blood and white complexion. So the kalpa too was known as Svetakalpa."

2-3. Gayatri; the goddess of Devas, born of me, had white limbs, white colour, white blood: She was known as Brahmani.

4. O lord of Devas, that was why I had been understood by you as the secret deity: By my penance I had assumed the form of Sadyojata.

Another characteristic of the Rudras is their rhythmic movement (drevana, from Vdru to move) which is responsible for the incessant flow of creation represented by the Satarudriya or Kotirudriya concept.

Cf. Harivamsa 2.74.22; 3.14.39.

96. Svetalobitah ~putana-Ivcta-rupeh ST, of new white complexion:

Various Kalpas

6. The title Sadyojala is secret Brahma; the twice-born who know me, who have assumed secret nature, shall attain nearness to me whence there is no return.

7-12. When the next kalpa known as Lohita, as a result of my colour, came, Gayatri glorified as a cow born with red flesh, red bone; red blood, red milk, red eyes and red udders was known as Brahmani. Since the colour was changed into red and since the lord was Vama, I was known as Vamadeva. O deity of great strength, then also, I, who was in a different colour, was recognised by you who had practised self-control by resorting to yoga: I was then known as Vamadeva. The twice-born who realise my Vamadeva form shall go to Rudra's world whence there is no return.

13. When the yuga gradually changed and I became yellow in colour, the kalpa was known as Pila—the name assigned by me:

14. Gayatri, the goddess of Devas born of me was named Brahmani. She was yellow in body, yellow in blood and yellow in colour.

15-17. O deity of great strength, there too; I was realized by yogins devoted to the practice of yoga, through your yogic mind. I was realized by you in the form of Tatpurusa. Hence, it was, O deity born of the golden egg, I got the Tatpurusa form. Persons endowed with penance, devoid of impurities, who are in contact with Brahman and who know me as Rudra, and Rudrani as Gayatri—the mother of the Vedas go to Rudra's world whence there is no return:

18-21. When I became terrible and black in colour the kalpa was known as Krsna after the colour assumed by me. There I resemble Kala (god of death). I am Kala (Time) = the reckoner of the worlds: O Brahma; I was then known by you as Ghora (the terrible) with terrible exploits. O lord of Devas, Gayatri, born of me, was black in body, black in blood, black in form and was named Brahmani. Hence to those who know me that I have assumed the ghora form, I, the changeless one, shall be Aghora (non-terrible) and Santa (quiescent).

22-25. O Brahma, when I assumed the universal form I was realized by you by means of the yogic trance. Gayatri, the



---


Liiigepurina sustainer of the worlds also assumed the universal form. To those who know me as having assumed this universal form, I shall always become auspicious and gentle: That Kalpa too will be known as Visvarupa (of universal form).

# 26-29.

The four who are of all kinds of forms will become popular as my sons. Since they are of different colours, their subjects too will be of different colours or castes (Varpas) and allowed the use of Gayatri. Man's aim of life will be four-fold: virtue, wealth, desire and liberation. All living beings will come under four groups, four stages of life. The feet of Dharma will be four since my sons are four in number.

# 30.

Hence the universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings is stationed in the four yugas. Since it is stationed in the four yugas it shall have four feet:

# 31-32.

There are eight worlds: Bhub, Bhuvah; Svar, Mahar, Janar, Tapas; Satya and Visnu: These are established in the eight substratums each of which is imperishable: Bhuh, Bhuvah; Svar and Mahah constitute the four substratums.

# 33.

The first is Bhuh, the second Bhuvah, the third Svar and Mahar is the fourth: Tapas; the seventh Satya.

# 34-35.

The fifth is Janah, the sixth whence people do not return to this world: The world of Visnu is the eighth: It is also the spot whence a return to this world is difficult: Beyond that is the world of Skandha and Uma endowed with all attainments of Rudra - the splendid.

# 36-39.

Beyond that is the world devoid of ego, region of yogins. The twice-born who are neither lustful nor angry and whose minds are devoted to yoga alone can enter it; Since Gayatri was seen by you as four-footed, the worlds are also four, viz. the world of Uma, Kumara, Mahesvara and Visnu.

Hence t0O, the animals became quadrupeds; the whiteness of their milk is also due to that:

2. O multiformed, O highly blessed god, when and in which age (yuga) will these bodies honoured by all be seen by the brahmins and by what penance or meditation of yoga? Obeisance to you, O lord Mahadeva.

3. On hearing his words and seeing him in front, the great lord Rudra revealed by Rk, Yajus and Saman smiled and said:

4-7. Except through meditation, neither through penance nor by conduct nor through gifts and holy rites nor by visits to pilgrim centres nor through sacrifices with ample monetary gifts nor through the study of the Vedas nor through wealth nor through knowledge of various kinds is it possible for men to see me.

8. Brahma, in the Varaha kalpa—the seventh in number, Varaha, will be the illuminator of the kalpa and your grandson, Vaivasvata, will be the Manu: containing the four yugas.

9-12. In the course of that kalpa towards the end of Kali, I will be born to bless the worlds and for the welfare of the brahmins, O Brahma. As the yuga proceeds further, when the great lord himself becomes Vyasa, during the first Dvapara age I will be born at the end of Dvapara as sage Sveta. I will be endowed with tuft and will stay on the excellent mountain Chagalal, beautiful peak of the Himalaya mountain.

After attaining Brahman's goal, they will approach me and will be devoted to the path of meditation and yoga. O Brahma, in the second Dvapara age lord Prajapati will become Vyasa, known as Sadya: Then, in the Kali age, I will be born by the name Sutara for the welfare of the world, with a desire for blessing the disciples. My disciples then will be known by these names:

19-24. Dundhubhi, Salarupa, Rcika and Kctuman. After attaining yoga and meditation and after establishing the Brahman on the earth they will attain the region and companionship of Rudra. In the third age, Dvapara, Bhargava will be the Vyasa. Then, at the end of Dvapara I will be born as Damana. There too four boys will be born to me; namely, Vikefa, Vikosa, Vipasa and Sapanasana. These four of great prowess will go to the world of Rudra through the same yogic path and will never return. In the fourth Dvapara yuga, Angiras will become Vyasa. At that time I shall be born by the name Suhotra: There, four ascetics will be born as my sons.

They will be steadfast and firm in body and the mind: With devotion towards me and by means of yoga they will be established in meditation and acquire self-control. The great Pasupata yoga can snap worldly ties and illuminate the path of knowledge: It is also conducive to Real knowledge: There are several paths of yoga and several paths of knowledge: But without taking recourse to the five-syllabled Mantra one cannot attain eternal bliss. When a person performs penance eschewing Dvandvas (mutually clashing opposites) he can become a liberated soul, as one who has attained the ripe fruit. Even if a man performs Pasupata rite for a single day he can obtain fruits, the like of which he cannot have either by Pancaratra or Sankhya.

Thus sing the Vedas perpetually. Then how did this happen that the lord of Devas worshipped you in the Linga and remained ever devoted to you?

145-150. On hearing the words of Brahma, lord Siva was delighted on account of the weighty relevancy of the question. He looked at him as if he would drink him through his eyes: Facing him, he then described the method of worship of the Linga. It was after worshipping the Linga in accordance with the instructions that you (Brahma), Vignu and Indra, the best of Devas and the sages, had attained their respective status; hence they continue to worship me further. There cannot be steadiness in piety without the worship of the Linga; hence lord Vignu worships me perpetually with due devotion and faith:

After saying this and blessing Brahma by glancing at him once again, Siva, the lord of Devas, vanished there itself: After gaining enlightenment from Siva to create everything afresh, Brahma joined his palms in reverence and bowed to Siva in the direction where he had vanished:

3-5. At that time, Nandin the son of Salaikayana was standing nearby: 0 sages of good rites, he heard everything and mentioned it to Brahma's son Sanat: From him Vyasa of great refulgence received the great discourse on the worship of the Linga, as also the bathing and other rites, as declared in the Vedas: I shall recount the same in the manner he heard it orally from Nandin.

# Nandin said

6. Henceforth, for the welfare of the brahmins, I shall recount the rules of procedure for the sacred ablution, which is destructive of all sins. Formerly it was declared by lord Siva himself:

7. By taking holy bath in accordance with this procedure; by worshipping lord Siva and by observing Brahmakurcal at that time, one is liberated from sins.

8. O most excellent among the sons of Brahma, three types of ablution are enjoined by Siva, the lord of Devas, for the welfare of the brahmins and others.

9-10. One shall at the outset perform the watery bath and then the sacred ash-bath and thereafter the Mantra ablution and then the worship of the Lord. One who is defiled in emotions and feelings is not purified even after taking bath in water or after applying ashes. Only one who is emotionally pure will proceed with purificatory rites and not otherwise.

11. There is no doubt that an emotionally defiled man does not become pure even if he takes bath in rivers, ponds and lakes till the dissolution of the universe.

12. The lotus-like mind of man is asleep due to Tamas. When it is wakened up by the refulgence of knowledge, man becomes pure.

13-14. The devotee shall take this kind of penance in the observance of which the five products of the cow (panchagavya) are eaten.

34. Agneyam - It is the bath of bhesma.

With great concentration and following his own school he shall perform the Brahmayajia duly: Though an excellent brahmin or sage but if he takes food without performing the five great Yajnas, he will be born in the womb of sows: Hence person should assiduously perform the same seeking for auspiciousness.

33. After Brahmayajha he shall perform Ablution for the self; collect the holy water duly and enter the camp with perfect self-control.

34. Outside the house he shall wash his hands and feet with water. Thereafter, for purity's sake he shall perform the sacred bath with ashes duly.

35-36. The ashes should be perfectly cleaned by means of Pranava. It must be taken from what remains after performing Agnihotra: When the sun has risen in the morning the Agnihotra should be performed with the Mantra "Jyotih suryah." In the evening the same should be performed with the Mantra "Jyotir Agnih." If the sun has not risen fully, the performance of Agnihotra is rendered ineffective. The ashes of the sacrifice performed after the sun has risen is alone sacred and splendid: nothing.

37-41. There is nothing holy like truth and nothing sinful like untruth: Repeating the Mantra of Isana he shall smear ashes on the head; repeating the Mantra of Tatpurusa, he shall smear ashes on his face; repeating the Mantra of Aghora he shall do so over his chest; O men of holy rites he shall apply ashes over the secret parts by repeating the Mantra of Vamadeva and similarly on the feet by repeating the Mantra of Sadya. By repeating the Pranava he shall smear ashes all over the body: Thereafter he shall wash hands and feet: After washing them off he shall take ashes with his mind get on the lord of Devas and perform Ablution repeating the Mantras viz, #Apo ' hiˢᵗʰᵃ¹⁶⁰ and other sacred formulas taken from Rk; Yajus and Siman texts. Thus for your welfare O brahmins, the mode of procedure for holy bath has been described to you succinctly. He who performs thus even for once shall attain the highest abode of God: jyotih Jurygh T4 410.5.

Nandin said

1. Listen, I shall briefly mention the rules of procedure for the worship of Linga. It is not possible to recount them in detail even in a hundred years.

4. After purifying the body he shall perform the rite of Nyasa of the mila mantras. Everywhere the five Brahmans (Sadyojata etc.) shall be fixed with the Pranava in order;
5. In the highly splendid aphorism viz, "Namah Sivaya" the Vedas are present in subtle form. Just as the holy fig tree is present in the subtle seed of the Nyagrodha so also the great Brahman is present in the great and splendid aphorism, all by Himself in a subtle form:
6. The devotee shall sprinkle the place of worship with scented sandal water, and consecrate the materials of worship either by washing or by sprinkling water.

The Sruti says {He is imperceptible through even Vedantas, to the knowers of thc Vedas too" He is devoid of beginning, middle and end. He is a medicine unto thosc who arc afflicted by thc sickness of worldliness.17 Hc is known a8 Sivatattva (Principle of Siva) and is stationed in the Siva Linga. He shall duly repeat the prayers and make obeisance. Hc shall circumambulate, offer Arghya, scatter flowers at the fcet, bow to the lord of Devas and superimpose Siva on the Atman: This, in brief; is the procedure of worshipping Siva in Linga. Now [ shall describe the internal worship of Linga to you.

# Mental Worship of Siva

Nandin said

122. The fery, slar and the lunarle disc shall be thought of within thc heart: Above that the trio of the Gunas and the Atmans shall be conceived: Above it, thc devotec shall meditate upon and worship the lord in both the aspects with and without attributes with half his body taken over by his beloved:

3-4. Since there are many objects to think upon, the thinker shall not think of anything except the following: The meditator shall conceive no distinction between the object and the means of meditation; otherwise, (i.e. if he thinks of enything other than these) knowledge does not arise in him:

# Lingopurdna

5-6. The word Purusa is derived thus purisete (he who lies in the body). He who worships the deity, the object of worship by means of meditation, is known as yajamana. Dhyeya (the object of meditation) is the lord himself: Dhyana is the thinking: Nirukti (bliss) the fruit of dhyana. One who knows about this attains the ultimate reality which is the substratum of Pradhana and Puruga.

7-10. Here the supreme lord, the object of meditation; is the twenty-sixth principle; the meditator (jiva) is the twenty-fifth, the avyakta or pradhana is the twenty-fourth: The seven principles constitute mahat, ahamkara, and five tanmatras. The organs of action are five; as also the organs of sense; then there is the mind and the five elements. Thus Siva is the twenty-sixth principle: He alone is the creator and sustainer. He is greater than Brahma. He has created Brahma. He is one who is above and greater than the universe, and is the universe itself:

I. Just as children are not born without their parents, so also the three worlds are not born without Siva and his consort.

Sanatkumara said

12-13. If the great lord who is the supreme power and the supreme soul is himself the doer how can he be an agent who causes activity of the individual souls? But the supreme lord has been mentioned by you as eternal, enlightened and unqualitative: How can he then bestow liberation? If he is without attributes how can he function?

Nandin said

14. It is Kala (Time) that evolves everything: Lord Siva evolves the Kala always. When the mind devoid of qualities jivitma, the individual soul, the enjoyer of the fruits of the world-tree (d. ebhib sampaditam bhunkte purutah pancavimfekah. Matga 3+27), constitutes the twenty-fifth category: He is also called 'bhokta purutah' 'bhokta suparnah' and he is controlled by the will of Ivera (d. Iivarecchavafah s0'pi jivitma kathyate budbaib) - The latter called sadvittbaka Siva - the twenty-sixth category who though transcendent is not competent to bestow Brcc: (C:}idvintebamanlivaram 1.71.109).

182. nipkaleh devoid of attributes, hence passive or inactive; but who imparts impetus to Timo_Kll who create the universe.

Montal Worship %f Siva
is set on lord Siva, lord Siva revcals His true, attributeless nature.

15-17. The universe appcars to be existent by his very activity: The cightle forms of the lord represent the empirical universe: Without the five elements - ether, earth, wind, fire and water and without the priest, the sun and the moon, the world has no existence: On consideration; it is evident that the gross world consisting of the mobile and immobile beings is the gross body of Rudra. These eight are the cosmic forms of the lord:

18-19. O excellent brahmins the sages declare that the subtle body of the lord is inexpressible: (The Vedas declare) "From him the words recede after failing to reach him along with the mind: He who realizes the bliss of the Brahman eschews fear from any quarter." Hence, after realizing the bliss of the pinaka-bearing lord, no one need be afraid.

20. After perceiving through their imagination that the elegances of Rudra are present everywhere, the Sages who perceive the truth say, "Everything is Rudra."

21-22. By making incessant obeisance to Brahma one's prestige is increased. All this is Brahman; everything is lord Rudra. Purusa is the great lord; Siva is the supreme lord. Thus the lord has been specified. Meditation is the sole thought about him.

183. The mind too when stabilized by concentration becomes inactive (nigkriye) as this helps in the emancipation of jIva. But; as a matter of fact, the terms bondage and release are creation and dissolution. Cf, Paicadasi quoted in ST.

184. The eight forms of lord Siva constitute the five great material elements, the sun, the moon and each stands in relation to its constituent as follows:

| (i) Bhava - water | (ii) Rudra - fire | (iii) Ugra - wind | (iv) Bhlma - ether | (v) Patupati - soul | (vi) Iana - tun | (vii) Mahadeva - moon |

23. The sage of good, holy rites, he should be thought upon in fourfold manner and perceived: He, the cause of worldly existence; is the world itself: He is the cause of liberation. He is the greatest ecstasy.

24-27. The four-arrayed path is prescribed for the yogin. Thought is counted as manifold: If it is centred in place it is called Sunietha; if centred in Rudra it is called Raudri; if centred in Indra Aindri; if in Soma Saumya; if in Narayana or in the sun or in the fire it is called after those names. If the devotee fixes in his mind in both ways that he is I and I am he that thought is called Brahmi. O brahmins, thus should devotee think of this universe both mobile and immobile as identical with Brahman:

28-29. Keeping the goal in his mind, the devotee shall eschew the thought of division between the mobile and immobile; also between what should be eschewed and what should not be eschewed, as also between what is possible and what is not possible of achievement and what should be done and what should not be done: He shall also remain satiated and contented: Such man's contemplation is the real one pertaining to Brahman and not otherwise: Thus in due order the mental worship of the lord has been recounted.

30-33. Those who carry out this sort of mental worship should also be adored by means of obeisance, etc. Even if they are hideous and deformed, these expounders of Brahman should not be censured. They should not be subjected to scrutiny by discerning persons: Those who censure them are narrow-minded persons who will become miserably unhappy as those sages of old who censured the lord in the Daruka forest:

An alternative explanation yad va dhyeya-dhyana-yajamans-preyojanarupaih caturvyuhaih: But according to Linge purane, the caturvyuha consists of (1) existence (emeklre), cause of existence (Gemaarahetu), cause of emancipation (mokrahetu) and emancipation (nbvrti).

1-3. O holy lord, now I wish to know what was committed by the dwellers of the Daruvana, those persons who had purified their souls by means of penance: How did Rudra the naked lord of sublimated sexuality assume hideous form and go to Daru forest? What did that great soul do there? Please recount factually the activities of that lord of Deves.

5. In order to propitiate the lord of Devas, the sages performed terrible penance in the Daru forest. They were accompanied by their wives; sons and sacrificial fires.

6. Rudra, the lord of the universe, the bull-emblemed omniscient deity known as Nilalohita, Dhurjati and Paramesana was delighted:

7-9. The lord of the universe, Rudra, wanted to test the sincerity of the dwellers of the Daru forest in respect of their sacrificial rites. He wanted to turn their minds from the observance of sacrificial rites to the path of renunciation: Thus in order to test their faith, and sportively too, he assumed a...

deformed but attractive appearance: He had three eyes and two hands. He was nude, and dark in complexion.

10. Even in this form he was extremely handsome: He was smiling and grinning, with seductive play of his eyebrows, thereby creating feelings of love in the hearts of women.

11. He the destroyer of cupid, the lord of extremely handsome features increased their sexual feelings:

12. On seeing a man of deformed features, black-red (in colour), even the chaste women followed him with great enthusiasm.

13. On receiving the gesture of a smile from his lotus-like face the women who had gathered at the threshold of huts in the forest or who stayed on the huts above trees, stopped all other activities and followed him not caring for their loosened garments and ornaments.

14. Some of these women; on seeing him felt their eyes reeling due to excitement. Even the old women who were beyond the age of seductive charms of the eyebrow began to display their amorous gestures.

15. On seeing him some women wore smiling faces: With their garments loosened little; and with their waist bands dislodged they began to sing.

16. Some brahmin ladies on seeing him in the forest found that their own fresh silken garments had got loosened: They cast off their bangles of diverse colours and went to their kinsmen.

17. One of them, on seeing him did not know that her upper and lower garments had stripped off. Others in their excitement could not distinguish between their kinsmen and the multi-branched trees though they were familiar.

18-19. Some sang; some danced; some fell and rolled down on the ground. O leading brahmin, another lady sat on the ground like an elephant and began to talk aloud: Looking smilingly they began to embrace one another all round: After stopping Rudra on his way they began to show all shrewd gestures. They asked, "who are you?"

20. Others said, "Be seated."

Victory over Death

Delighted in their minds some said, "Where are you going? Be pleased with us.

21. Due to the Maya of Rudra even the chaste ladies fell down in an awkward posture with their clothes loosened and their tresses dishevelled; in the very presence of their husbands.

22. Even after hearing their words and seeing their diverse activities, the unchanging lord Rudra did not utter anything, good or bad.

23. On seeing the crowd of women and Rudra in this situation the brahmins, the leading sages began to say harsh words:

24. Their powers of austerity were ineffective against Rudra in the same manner as the lustre of the stars in the sky against the refulgence of the sun.

25. (Such had been the spiritual prowess of the sages, formerly) that the sacrifice of the great-souled Brahma perished due to the curse of a sage, even though the sacrifice was meant for general welfare.

26. Due to the curse of Bhrgule, Visnu of great prowess was compelled to take ten incarnations and undergo suffering in each incarnation.

27. O knower of Dharma, Indra's organ too was cut and cast off by the infuriated sage Gautama.

28. The Vasus had to prolong their stay in the womb by a brahmin's curse. Nahuga was turned into a serpent by the curse of sages, dried by the curse of brahmins.

29. The milk ocean was made unfit for drinking by the brahmins' curse, though it was the perpetual abode of Visnu.

30-32. In order to atone for this Visnu went to Varanasi and resorted to the lord of Avimukta. He performed the ablution of the three-eyed lord, the lord of Devas, with milk. With unswerving devotion, he, together with Brahma and the

Sprinkled Siva with milk which coming in contact with the body of the lord became nectarlike and filled the ocean wherein lord Visnu made his residential abode:

1. Dharma had been cursed by the noble sage Mandavya.
2. The Vrenis along with Krena had been cursed by Durvasas and other noble sages.
3. Rama and his younger brother Lakemana had been cursed by the noble sage Durvasas. Lord Visnu was even kicked by the sage Bhrgu.
4. These and many others, except the odd-eyed lord of Uma, the overlord of Devas had been made subservient by the brahmins.
5. Thus deluded the sages of Daruvana did not understand Rudra. They spoke harsh words to Rudra who thereupon disappeared.
6. In the morning all those sages with perplexed minds and blurred thinking went from Daruvana to Brahma of noble soul who was seated in the highest seat: They informed him about what had happened in that holy Daru forest:
7. Pondering over everything in his mind Brahma understood what they did in the holy Daru forest: He stood up with palms joined in reverence and bowed to Rudra. He then spoke hurriedly to the sages who had their abodes in Daru forest:
8. Fie upon You all who had attained excellent treasure; O brahmins; but had unluckily wasted it:
9. The man with Linga who had been seen by you all without Lingas, the person of deformed features was the supreme lord himself.

mode of self-expiation in this world; for excellent brahmin houscholders; there is no other way to cross the ocean of worldly existence:

46. Formerly, a householder known as SudarSana, vowed to conquer the God of Death: He said to his chaste wife:

47. "O lady of good holy rites, fine eye-brows and good fortune, listen to what I say, assiduously. Never should you dishonour the guests who visit your house.

48. Since everyone of the guests is the Pinaka-bearing lord, you should dedicate even yourself to the guest and adore him.

49. That chaste lady, on being urged thus, became extremely dejected. Helpless that she was, she wept and said to her husband, "O lord, please explain what you have just said." Hearing this, Sudarsana said:

50. "O noble lady, everything belongs to lord Siva and since the Guest is lord Siva himself; everything is his. Hence the guest should always be adored:

On being urged thus by her husband, the chaste wife accepted this behest (wholeheartedly) just as one places on his head (reverently) the flowers offered to God. Thus she went on (attending to her duties).

54. Thus worshipped by her, Dharma disguised as a brahmin said, "O gentle lady, where has your noble husband Sudarsana gone?

55-58. O noble lady, enough of this cooked rice and other eatables I say, you should dedicate yourself (to me). Remembering what had been previously mentioned by her husband, that chaste lady full of bashfulness and with closed eyes, began to move (toward him). Again she began saying: But then, all the same; she made up her mind to dedicate herself to Dharma there itself at the behest of her own husband:

meantime; Sudarsana, the husband of that lady, came to the threshold and called to her, "Come, come, O gentle lady? Where have you been?" replied to him:

It was the guest himself who said:

59-64. "O Sudarsana, O highly blessed one, I am now engaged in sexual intercourse with this wife of yours. What should be done here may kindly be mentioned: O leading brahmin, the sexual intercourse is concluded: excellent brahmin, I am satisfied."

Sudarsana the noble brahmin then said in great delight: "O excellent brahmin, enjoy her as you please: I shall go away now."

Thereafter Dharma who was delighted (at this incident) revealed himself (in his own form). He granted him whatever he desired and told him again:

"O leading brahmin, even mentally this splendid lady has not been enjoyed by me. Undoubtedly, it was to ascertain her devotion that I came here. O brahmin of good rites, with this single act of piety you have conquered death: O the prowess of this penance!" Saying thus he went away. Hence all guests should be worshipped in the same manner:

65. O unfortunate noble brahmins; of what avail is much talk: All of you should seek refuge in the very same Rudra immediately.

66. On hearing the words of Brahma the leading brahmins became distressed: With eyes blinded by tears they saluted Brahma and said:

The Brahmins said:

67-69. "O blessed one; we do not care even slightly for our lives or for our woman folk who have become deformed: But that irreproachable omnipresent trident-bearing and pinaka-holding lord has been censured and cursed by us out of ignorance though our power to curse was rendered ineffective by his mere looking at us. O lord of Devas, you should now tell us the procedure for renunciation in order to see the terrible lord, the chief of Devas, the god with the matted hair."

Brahma said

# 70-74.

O excellent brahmins, the devotee shall, at first, learn the Vedas with great devotion from his preceptor: He shall always ponder over their meanings and understand Dharma. He shall remain a disciple till he completes all learning or up to twelve years.

He shall then take the sacred ablution at the conclusion of his student life: He shall marry a wife, and procreate thereafter sons of holy rites. He shall then allot befitting means of livelihood to his sons. Then he shall perform the rites of worship to the lord by performing Agnistoma and other sacrifices. After going to forest he shall worship the great soul. Maintaining a diet of milk and controlling his senses he shall worship Devas in the fire, for a period of twelve years, or twelve months or twelve fortnights or twelve days.

# 75-76.

Then he shall offer in the same fire all vessels used for the sacrifice. He shall consign all the earthen and wooden vessels to the waters and the metallic ones to his preceptor: He shall distribute all his belongings to the brahmins without hesitation. He shall prostrate on the ground and make obeisance to the preceptor. Becoming detached he shall then renounce everything and become an ascetic.

# 77.

He shall have off his hairs along with the tuft and cast off his sacred thread: He shall perform five offerings in the waters saying 'Bhuh svaha' attaining complete liberation.

avail are these to a devotee of Rudra? Neither the holy rites nor renunciation, in accordance with the injunctions, nor sacrifices, nor charitable gifts, nor the different sorts of Homas nor the acquisition of all kinds of Sastras and Vedas are of any avail to him; By means of devotion to Rudra, death was conquered by Sveta. May you too have such devotion to the great lord, the benefactor and the Supreme Soul.

# The Story of Sage Sveta

Nandin said

1. On being thus urged by Brahma, the leading brahmins, the great sages asked him about the sacred story of Sveta: Brahma said
2. 0 brahmins, there was a certain sage named Sveta in the cave of a mountain: His span of life was nearing its end: Hence he worshipped and eulogised the great lord with devotion. He repeated the Mantras of the holy hymn Rudradhyaya beginning with 'Namaste' (Obeisance to Thee).
3. Then the god of Death, of great splendour thought that the time of death had arrived for the excellent brahmin. 0 leading brahmins, thinking of taking him away he approached the sage. Sveta saw Kala and though the time of his death was imminent he meditated upon the three-eyed lord Rudra and worshipped him:
4. I worship the three-eyed lord of great fragrance, who increases prosperity. What will the god of Death do for me? Since I am Death of Death.

Looking at Sveta, the god of death terrifying to the worlds said smilingly: 7-11. {Come, 0 Sveta. What fruit do you gain by this means? 0 excellent brahmin, who can save One caught in my clutches even if he be Rudra, or Vienu or Brahma the lord of the universe? 0 brahmin, how does this procedure pertaining to Rudra affect me: I am bent upon taking you to my world sage, since your span of life has come to an end:

On hearing these terrible words though mingled with virtuous thoughts, the leading Sage cried out "Ha Rudra, Rudra, Rudra:" Glancing at Kala he spoke with eyes full of tears, excitedly, in dejected mood:

Sveta said: Kala, 12. 0 what can be done by you if our bull-emblemed lord, Rudra, the source of origin of all Devas, is present in this Linga? 13. 0 lord of great arms, of what avail is this behest (of yours) to persons like me who are extremely devoted to Rudra? I ask you to go away, the way you have come.

14-15. On hearing this Kala of sharp fangs and terrible to look at, became infuriated: The terrible god with the noose in his hands roared like a lion and clapped his hands again and again. He then bound the sage whose time of death had arrived and addressed him thus:

16. "0 brahmin sage, 0 Sveta, you have been bound by me for being taken to my abode: What has been done now by your Rudra the lord of Devas? Where is your devotion? Where is Rudra and your worship and where the fruit thereof? Where am I and whence have I to fear? 0 Sveta, you have been bound by me:

18. 0 Sveta, is your Rudra stationed in this Linga? If so, he is utterly inactive: How can he be worshipped?"

19-20. Then Rudra, the destroyer of Kama and sacrifice, the three-eyed lord came hurriedly with a laugh, accompanied by Uma, Nandin and the leading ganas in order to slay Yama who had come to kill the brahmin.

On looking at lord Rudra, the destroyer of death; as also at Yama who fell instantaneously at the sight of the lord, Sveta roared loudly. To leading brahmins, the gods too cried loudly, and bowed to the lord as well as Uma. The leading sages were delighted much.

Over the heads of the sage and Rudra, the sky-roving gods showered cool and splendid flowers from the firmament:

On hearing these words the anxious sages bowed to Brahma along with their wives and sons. Hence, devotion to lord Rudra bestows virtue; love and wealth. It yields victory to the sage: It grants him victory over death:

35-37. Formerly, by means of devotion, Dadhica conquered lord Vishnu and his associate Devas. He killed Keupa with the tip of his foot: He acquired adamantine bones. By glorifying the lord, I too conquered death: Even by the great sage Sveta who had fallen into the jaws of death, death was conquered by the grace of the lord, in the manner it was conquered by me:

Brahma said:

3. This great lord should be known as Mahesvara. Greater than him there is no other protection to be sought:

4-5. He is the lord of Devas, sages and pitra. During the period of dissolution at the end of a thousand sets of four yugas, the lord becomes Kala and destroys all living beings: He alone creates subjects by his splendour:

Hc is thc thunderbolt-armed (Indra) and the discus-bearing Vignu marked by Srivatsa. He is called Yogin in the Krta age, Kratu in the Treta, Kalagni in the Dvapara and Dharmaketu in the Kali age. Thesefour are the forms of Rudra which the learned men meditate upon.

The Linga should be symmetrical within and without; at the place of support of the swollen knob it should be octangular. In other places it should be cylindrical and of attractive appearance. One should worship only such a fine Linga.

Tamas is the fire god; Rajas is Brahma and Sattva is Visnu. Although there is a single deity at the base these are glorified as its forms.21

The leading brahmins who anger and sense-organs, make the Linga endowed with all these traits: It is there that the Brahman stays along with all his yogic powers: Hence they worship (in the linga) lord Isana the lord of the chiefs of Devas, the unchanging deity.

The Linga should be cylindrical, splendid, of the size of thumb, appealing to all and level in the umbilical region. It may have eight or sixteen equal angles. Its zone must be well built so that it should yield all desires. The supporting altar is twice its size or equal in size, and approved by all. The cow's hole shall have all the characteristics of the altar and shall be a third of its size. O excellent brahmins, the border all round shall be at least one yava in breadth: The Linga shall be made of gold, silver or copper. The altar shall extend up to thrice its size all round. It (the altar) shall be circular, triangular, quadrangular or hexagonal in shape; It shall be free from cracks, and with all characteristics clearly defined. After installing it duly in accordance with the rules governing worship, O brahmins, the Kalasa (water-pot) shall be placed in the middle of the altar, and cereals217 shall be placed within it. The holy water shall then be inspired with the Mantras of the syllable 'namah Sivaye'.

If you worship with such materials as arc available you will attain Siddhi. All of you joined by your sons and kinsmen shall worship him with concentration and mental purity:

All of you with your palms joined in reverence shall resort to thc trident-bearing lord. You will then sce the lord of Devas who is inaccessible to persons with no self-control:

On sceing him your ignorance and sins will perish. Thercafter forest-dwellers circumambulated Brahma of unmeasured prowess and returned to Daruvana. They propitiated the lord in the manner prescribed by Brahma.

In the different dry tracts of land, or in the caves of the mountains Or in thc auspicious but isolated banks of the rivers they performed penances. Some stayed in water, looking splendid with moss clinging to them, some were exposed to the rain in the course of penance and some stood on the tips of their toes. Others lived On grains crushed by teeth: Others on grains crushed with pieces of rocks. Some adopted Virasana postures and others were engaged in the activities of deer. Thus these wise devotees spent time in penance and worship: When a year was completed and Spring arrived, in that Krta age, the lord wanted to bless them with his grace. With sympathy towards his devotees, the delighted lord came to Daru forest on the splendid mountain Himalaya.

The lord had vulgar traits: He was stark nude: He had smeared his limbs with ashes: His hands were engaged in whirling firebrand. His eyes were red and tawny. Sometimes he laughed boisterously, sometimes he sang surprisingly: Sometimes he danced amorously and sometimes he cried repeatedly: He roamed round the hermitages and begged for alms. He assumed forms of his choice by his maya. When the lord thus came to the forest the sages culogised him with devotion. By their pleasant countenance and in the company.

O Rudra, your activities wonderful and incomprehensible are secret and unintelligible even to Brahma and other Devas. We do not understand either your progress or regress:

Obeisance to the lord who is naked; who bears the trident; who dissolves the universe; who is handsome; who is an axe to the tree of the universe; to one with terrifying face:

Obeisance to One bowed by all; obeisance to One who bows to his own Atman; obeisance to one with blue tuft; obeisance to one with poison in his neck.

Obeisance to one who is blue-necked, to one who applies the ash from the cremation ground all over the body. You are Brahma among all Devas: You are Nilalohita among all Rudras.

2. The brahmin who reads or listens to the hymn glorified by you all or narrates this to the brahmins shall attain leadership among my attendants:

3-4. O leading sages, I shall mention what is conducive to your welfare and sacred to the devotees: Everything feminine is goddess Prakrti born of my body. O brahmins, everything masculine is Purusa born of my body: O brahmins, undoubtedly my creation is through both of these.

5. Hence no one shall censure the naked ascetic who is devoted to me, who expounds Brahman but who behaves like children and mad people:

6-8. Those devotees of Mahadeva who are interested in applying ashes; who burn their sins through ashes; who are engaged in meditation and carry out what has been laid down in the scriptures; who have perfect control over the sense-organs; who have sublimated their sexuality; who worship the great lord with perfect verbal, mental and physical control; reach Rudra's world and do not return therefrom: Hence this secret, sacred and divine rite of the deity of manifest Linga.

9. The observers of the above holy rite have all types of forms; they shave off their heads and they observe the rite of ashes. No learned man shall revile at them nor should they be transgressed shall laugh derisively.

10. No one at them nor shall he speak words displeasing to them if he desires for welfare here and hereafter. The stupid man who censures them, censures the lord himself:

11-12. He who worships them worships Siva. Thus, with desire for the welfare of the worlds, the great lord sports about as a great yogin in every Yuga, with ashes smeared all over his body:

The lord said

1. I shall recount to you the whole glory in a nutshell: I am Agni (Fire god) the creator of Soma and I am Soma that resorts to Agni:
2. Agni carries what is consigned to it by way of Homa: Since it rests in the world, the universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings is often burned by it:
3. Everything reduced to ashes becomes excellent and sacred. With ashes, Soma attains power and rejuvenates living beings. He who performs the rite of oblation into the fire?
4. The rite of 'Tryayusa' is liberated from sins due to the virtue of ashes which constitute power: 'bhas' to shine,
5. The word Bhasman is derived from bhasate - shines or from causal of 'bhu' to cause to reach, or from 'bhaks' to eat; since it devours all sins it is called Bhasman. Pitrs drink Soma. The Devas drink Soma. The entire universe of the mobile and immobile beings is of the nature of Agni and Soma:
6. I am Agni of great splendour. This great Uma is Soma: I am Agni and Soma together. I am Purusa as well as Prakrti.
7. Hence, blessed ones, the ashes constitute my virility: I hold my virility by my physical body. This is the fact: since then, protection is afforded by the ashes:
8. At times of inauspicious events and even in lying-in chambers it is resorted to for securing protection.
9. One whose soul is purified by applying ashes over the body, one who has conquered anger and the sense-organs, never returns after coming near me.

23. One shall be devoid of the defects of tamas and rajas in his character. Understanding that things of the world are subject to decay and destruction one shall always be devoted to the yoga of PaSupati.

24-26. He should meditate on the vrata of Pasupati Siva that is destructive of all sins. He who reads this, being pure and faithful, having conquered the sense-organs, shall become purified of all sins and shall go to Rudra's world: On hearing this all those sages, Vasistha and others and all the excellent brahmins smeared their bodies with ashes and became freed of all desires. At the end of the kalpa they started towards the world of Rudra.

27. Hence even the deformed and dirty persons are worthy of worship and should not be censured. Leading brahmins whether handsome or dirty should also be worshipped: They may be leading yogins.

28. Of what avail is much talk? Excellent brahmin devotees of Siva should be worshipped by all means like Siva himself: Even dirty leading brahmins may be devotees of Siva and steady in their rites.

29-31. By devotion to Siva much can be achieved in the world in the manner of Dadhica who could conquer even Venu the lord of Devas: Hence by all means, those devotees with matted hair or tonsured head, or naked anchorites (power of suppressing desire).

The last one is sometimes substituted by earvejhatva. Linga reads iccha-kamavassyitvam for bAmavassyitvam. Some other siddhis such as dure-sravana (hearing from distance), snistambhe (checking the heat of the fire) etc. are also added to these: For detail, see Vicaspati's Tattva-Kabmedi on Iverekrmna's Sankhya-Karika.

"Brahmadyah petevas tepam patib pefupatih smrtah." JIvu in different strata of life from Brahma to man are pafus, bound with the doole of vitayes (objects of worldly pleasure). But each pelu can get release by eschewing these vitayes and by his concentrated meditation on Siva.

4. In course of time; incidentally a dispute arose between Ksupa and Dadhica as to who was the better, a Kshatriya or Brahmin:

5-6. (Ksupa said) The king holds the physical body of the eight guardians of the quarters. Hence I am Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirrti, Varuna, Vayu, Soma (Moon), and Dhanada (Kubera; the lord of wealth). I am Isvara (overlord). I should not be dishonoured:

216-25. excellent brahmin of holv rites, great sage, because pueti (nourishment) is the very name of Puruga, He is the increaser of nourishment (pustivardhana) of all the divine creations beginning with Mahat and ending with Visesa, of Visqu, of Brahma, of sages, of Indra, and of Devas: Hence; we do worship that immortal nectarine lord Rudra by means of actions, by penance, by study of the Vedas, by yoga and by meditation: By this truth; Siva himself shall liberate us from the bondage of Death: The lord is the cause of bondage and liberation like the cucumber fruit:

This Mantra that resuscitates life has been acquired by me from Siva:

26. By repeating this Mantra, by doing sacrifice with this, by drinking water inspired by this mantra, by meditating on this Mantra in the presence of the Linga, O brahmin, one shall not have any fear of death: words Dadhica propitiated Siva by means of penance and attained adamantine bones, indestructibility and absence of affliction.

27. After hearing his means of penance and attained adamantine bones, indestructibility and absence of affliction.

28-30. Having obtained indestructibility and adamantine bones Dadhica hit the king severely on the head with the tip of his foot: King Keupa; in return; hit Dadhica in his chest with his thunderbolt But by the grace of lord Siva the thunderbolt was rendered ineffective: It could not injure Dadhica the great soul of adamantine body.

31. On seeing the greatness and power of Dadhica by way of indestructibility and unaffected state; Kgupa propitiated the lotus-eyed lord Visnu, the younger brother of Indra.

# Dialogue between Ksupa and Dadhica

Nandin said

1-3. Lord Vienu was pleased with his (Dadhica's) worship: Accompanied by Sri and Bhumi (his consorts), holding the conch, the discus; the iron club and lotus in his hands, wearing crown, bedecked in all ornaments, clad in yellow robes, surrounded by Devas and asuras, the Garuda-bannered glorious lord Visnu granted him divine vision. Seeing him by his divine vision; Ksupa bowed to the Garuda-bannered deity and eulogised him with pleasing words:

4-8. You are the primordial deity with no origin: You are Prakrti; you are Purusa, the protector of the world: You are Visnu the lord of the universe: You are Brahma, with the universe for your body. You are the first principle: O Visnu, you alone are the greatest luminary: You are the supreme soul, O lord of Sri, you are the greatest abode: O lord of the earth; Rudra enveloped by tamas originated from your fury - Brahma, the creator of the universe enveloped by rajas was born of your grace: The lord enveloped by sattva, was born of your grace: O Visnu, O Rudra, you are identical with the universe:

9. The principles of intellect, ego, the subtle elements and the sense-organs O lord, omniformed, are all presided over by you alone.

10. O great lord, O lord of the universe, O Brahma, preceptor of the universe; be pleased, O lord of the chiefs of Devas; be pleased.

11. O Lord of the universe, be pleased: I seek in you, worthy of being sought refuge in. O omniscient lord of long arms.

12. O liberator of mankind; O highly blessed one! lord of great strength O best of souls O unopposed O great Visnu perpetual obeisance be to you: seat in the midst of.

The stars, constellations and firmament are the ornaments round your neck: How shall I eulogise you the lord of Devas? You are worthy of worship. Whatever was done, heard and glorified faithfully as divine, whatever was sacrificed by me 0 Lord you shall bear all: Obeisance be to you:

Nandin said

19-21. This hymn of Visnu is destructive of all sins. He who reads or listens to this hymn uttered by Ksupa, he who narrates this to the brahmins with devotion, goes to the world of Visnu: After worshipping thus and eulogising the invincible lord who is eulogised by the lord of Devas and others and after bowing to him with bent head, Ksupa spoke in submission:

The King said

22. 0 lord, long before; a certain Brahmin, known as Dadhica became friend of mine: He is the knower of Dharma and a humble soul.

23-25. He is engaged in worshipping Siva always. He cannot be killed by anyone at all times. 0 lord of Devas; he struck me on the head with his left foot; in the open assembly with great contempt: 0 Visnu, 0 Visva, 0 lord of the Universe, arrogantly he said: (I am not afraid of anybody anywhere) lord of universe; I wish to defeat that brahmin Dadhica. 0 Visnu, please; help me to my welfare:

# Dialogue between Ksupa and Dadhica

Nondin said:

1. Vignu understood that Dadhica was indestructible: Visnu then remembered the incomparable prowess of Siva.
2. After remembering thus, Vignu said to Ksupa, born of the sneczc of Brahma: "O leading king, after attaining lord Siva, brahmins have nothing to fear:
3. Particularly O king, the devotees of Rudra are free from fear always: If this be true in every respect in regard to base men what then in the case of Dadhica?
4. Hence; O blessed one, O king, you have no hope of victory: Of course I shall give a slight pain to the brahmin inviting a curse on me along with Devas.
5. O leading king; at Dakra's sacrifice due to Dadhica's curse I and other Devas will be destroyed but revived again.
6. Hence, O king; coming into contact with the leading brahmin I shall endeavour for your victory over Dadhica.

Nandin said:

On hearing these words Ksupa said to Vignu: "So be it." The lord too went to the hermitage of the brahmin Dadhica:
The lord, favourably disposed to his devotees, assumed the form of a brahmin: The preceptor of the universe congratulated the brahmin sage Dadhica and said:
The lord said: "So Dadhica, O brahminical sage, O unchanging one engaged in the worship of Siva, I desire to choose a boon from you: You should grant the same."
On being requested by Vignu, the lord of Devas, Dadhica said: "All that you desire has been understood: I am not afraid of you:
O Vignu, you have come to me in the guise of a brahmin. By the grace of Rudra, I can understand everything the past, future and present; O Vignu, O lord of Devas, deity of good rites, leave this guise of a brahmin: O destroyer of Madhu, O lord of Devas you have been propitiated by Ksupa: I know you."
O lord Vignu, you are favourably disposed towards your devotees; O lord Vignu, your favouring to your devotees is but proper:

39. O lord, O lotus-eyed, bestower of boons; it behoves you to say frankly if you are afraid of me engaged that I am in the worship of Siva:

40. O Visnu, I do not speak in vain. I am not afraid. In this world I am not afraid of Devas, or brahmins:

Nandin said:

41. On hearing the words of Dadhica, Visnu in a moment cast off his guise of a brahmin: He assumed his own form and said smilingly:

The Lord said:

42. O Dadhica of good holy rites, you have no fear anywhere since you are engaged in the worship of Siva. Indeed you are omniscient:

43. O leading brahmin, at my behest you should say at least once "I am afraid". Obeisance to you: Please say to Ksupa in the open assembly that you are afraid:

44. Even after hearing the appeasing words of Visnu, the great sage did not say that he was afraid. Bearing Siva,

45. It was due to the prowess of the Pinaka, the lord of Devas, the benefactor and omniscient lord that the great sage did not say he was afraid:

46. Then the infuriated lord Visnu desired to burn the sage and so raised his discus.

47. By the power of Dadhica, even in the presence of Ksupa, the discus Sudarsana became blunted:

48. On seeing the discus with blunted tip, Dadhica said to the Discus-bearing lord, who is the cause of manifesting distinction between the existent and non-existent.

49. O lord Visnu, formerly, the terrible discus, Sudarsana was assiduously got by you from Siva.

50. That discus can never kill me. You now try with the missile of Brahma or other similar weapons.

Nandin said:

51. On hearing his words and on seeing his own weapon powerless, lord Visnu discharged all missiles from all directions towards him.

Dialogue between Ksupa and Dadhica

52. The powerful Devas thereafter rendered help to Vispu who was engaged in fighting against a single brahmin;

53. Then Dadhica who had adamantine bones and who had perfect all-round self control took up a handful of kusa grass. Remembering Siva he discharged it against Devas:

54. It became divine trident as lustrous as fire of dissolution. Like fire at the close of a Yuga it felt inclined to burn all Devas:

55. O sage, all those weapons which were discharged by Indra, and other Devas bowed to the trident:

56-57. O excellent brahmin, Devas whose strength was dissipated fled from the scene: Then lord Visnu, created out of his body millions and millions of divine attendants resembling himself: The excellent sage burnt all of them immediately:

58-60. Thereafter, Visnu became Universe-formed in order to instil awe in Dadhica. The excellent brahmin saw several groups of Devas distinctly, as also crores of Rudras, crores of Ganas, crores of Cosmic Eggs in the body of Vispu: On seeing all these therein, the son of Cyavana was surprised:

61. The great sage sprinkled the universe-formed Vispu with water: He spoke to Visnu, the unborn lord of the universe, identical with the universe:

62. O mighty-armed one, eschew this deception: O there are thousands of skills (or tricks) with me also which are difficult to comprehend, and which come handy by mere thinking: O uncensured see within me the entire universe along with yourself; Brahma and Rudra: I shall give you divine vision.

63. After saying this, the sage showed everything in his own body. He spoke again to lord Visnu, the source of origin of all Devas.

64. "Of what use is this deception? O lord, of what avail is the power of magic? O Visnu, what purpose is served by the intrinsic power of objects or by the power of meditation?

65-67. Hence, eschewing this deception you should fight against me strenuously:

248. Vijilnam-maye.

On hearing these words and on seeing his miraculous power, Devas ran away. Once again, the lotus-born preceptor of the universe, Brahma, restrained lord Vishnu who had become inactive:

68. On bearing the words of Brahma, lord Vishnu who was defeated bowed to the sage and went away.

69. Keupawa was extremely afflicted and dejected. He honored and adored Dadhica, the leading sage, and prayed thus:

70. O Lord and friend Dadhica, what has been committed by me due to ignorance may be excused: What can be affected by Vishnu or Devas in your case since you are a devotee of Rudra?

71. O great Lord, be pleased. O the most excellent among men of devotion, devotion of this type is difficult of access to wicked persons; to base Kshatriyas like me.

72. On hearing the words of the king, the brahmin Dadhica, the most excellent of those who perform penances, blessed the king. The leading sage then cursed Devas:

73-74. May you, including Indra and lord Vishnu and all great sages, be destroyed by the fire of fury of Rudra in the holy sacrifice of the patriarch Daksha:

After cursing thus and glancing at Keupa, the brahmin said again: O leading king; brahmins should be worshipped by Devas, kings, and by the different groups of people: O king; the brahmins alone are strong and powerful.

76. After saying this, the brahmin of great lustre entered his own abode. The king, after saluting Dadhica, too went to his own abode.

77. The place of this event is known as the holy center, Sthanvifvara. After reaching Sthanvisvara, one shall attain identity with Siva.

250. Sthanvisvara or Sthanvilvara is mentioned by Bapabbett in his historical prose, EIvya Hartecerita, written in the first half of the seventh century A.D. The earliest notice of this place by a foreigner is found in the record of the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang, the contemporary of Harshavardhana, the king of Sthanvisvara and Kannauj.

The city is identified with the modern town Thanesar, near Kurukshetra, Haryana State. It derives its name from an ancient temple dedicated to lord Shiva.

0 great sage, even lord Brahma will not grant you a son without death or not born of a womb: Then what about others?

Even that lord Brahma is not devoid of death himself: The lord himself is born of a womb. The lotus-born deity of great splendour is born of an egg.

The lord is born of Mahesvara: He is the son of Uma. His span of life is limited to two Parardhas.

Thousands and crores of kalpas that constitute his day have passed by: So many yet remain.

Hence, O leading brahmin, eschew your ardent desire for a son devoid of death or not born of a womb. Accept a son like yourself:

Sailidi said:

On hearing his words my meritorious father well-known in the world as Silada again spoke to the husband of Saci (i.e: Indra):

Silida said:

lord, I have already heard that Brahma was born of an Egg, was born of a lotus and also was born of Mahesvara:

Formerly, O Mahendra, of great arms, Narada my elder brother, had been saying this and I have heard it from him. But tell me, how this can be? Dakeayani was the grand-daughter of Brahma since Daksa was the son of the lotus-born deity? How then can Brahma be her son?

Indra said:

O brahmin, your doubt is reasonable: I shall tell you the cause of the same that happened to Brahma in the Tatpurusa kalpa: After pondering over all things the supreme lord created Brahma. In the Meghavahana kalpa, Visnu, the lord of the universe, became cloud and bore the supreme lord Siva for a thousand years with ease and comfort:

20-21. Then they call that kalpa by the name Megha-vahana. On seeing him born of His body Brahma approached Siva and said: "0 lord, Vispu was born of your left and I am born of your right side:"

Then Brahma attained omniscience in trice. He then hurried out and met Vignu in the vast ocean enveloped by darkness. He saw Visnu in an illustrious spot studded with gold and jewels which was mentally created by Visnu himself: It was inaccessible to wicked persons, invisible even to the pious like Indra and others:

27-32. Brahma saw the Purusa in whose heart the entire universe rested. He was lying down on the couch constituted by the body of the serpent Sesa. He had lotus-like eyes and four arms holding the conch, discus, iron club, and the lotus. He was wearing ornaments and in that form he resembled the orb of the moon: He bore the mark Srivatsa over his breast. Brahma beheld him with pleasure evident in his face: His lotus-like feet had turned red due to the contact with the lotus-like soft hands of Laksmi: He was Isana the greatest Atman: By tamas he was in the form of Kala: By rajas he was the initiator of creation of the world: By sattva he was the sustainer of all. He was Paramesvara, the soul of all, the noble Atman, the supreme soul. Brahma saw him lying down in his yogic slumber in the milky ocean full of nectar. On seeing him he spoke to him thus:

They eulogised the terrible lord with matted hair. They bowed to the lord, the bestower of boons, standing far away out of respect: The great lord, the protector of the universe blessed Brahma and Visnu and vanished there itself:

8 With great effort he made the earth even, without ups and downs. The lord created the rivulets, rivers and the oceans as before:

9 The lord having the form of a boar as the uplifter of the earth, gathered all the mountains together: As before he created the four worlds beginning with Bhuh:

10 The lord who was the most excellent of all intelligent persons became inclined to create the chief creation, the animal creation, and then the divine and human creations.

11-16 With the intellect free from wretchedness the lord at the outset created Sananda, Sanaka and Sanatana the most excellent among the good. All these practised Naigkarmya and attained the greatest being: By his yogic learning he created Marici, Bhrgu, Angiras; Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Daksa, Atri, Vasistha, Sankalpa, Dharma and Adharma. Thus there are twelve sons to Brahma born of the unmanifest:

At the outset the eternal lord had created Rbhu and Sanatkumara. These two fresh born sons had sublimated their sexuality, and were divine expounders of Brahman. They were bachelors, omniscient, conceivers of everything and equal to Brahma himself: After creating the sargas-Mukhya etc. O Sila Sana; the lotus-born deity, the creator of the universe, evolved all the special characteristics of the different ages.

# Specific Dharmas of Four Yugas

Sailadi said:

1 On hearing the narration of Indra, my father, the great sage, bowed to the lord of Devas, and with the palms joined in reverence he asked him again:

Silada said:

2-3. O lord Indra, O omniscient one; bowed down by the chiefs of Devas O lord of Saci, O thousand-eyed lord of the universe, O Mahesvara, how did the lotus-born deity Brahma evolve the specific dharmas of the yugas? It behoves you now to recount it to me who have bowed down to you:

Sailadi said:

4. On hearing the words of Silada, the noble-souled Indra recounted the dharmas of the yugas in detail in the manner seen by him.

Indra said:

5. Know that first comes Krtayuga, O sage Treta comes next: Thereafter Dvapara and Tisya (Kali) Yugas: These are the four yugas in brief:

6. Sattvaguna signifies Krta yuga; rajas signifies Treta; rajas-cum-tamas signifies Dvapara: Tamas signifies Kali: These should be known as the special characteristics in each of the different yugas.

7. Meditation is the greatest activity in Krta Yuga; Yajna (sacrifice) in Treta; worship is the main activity in Dvapara and pure charitable gift in the Kali age. So

8. Four thousand divine years constitute Krta yuga: many hundred years (i.e four hundred) constitute the preceding transition period (sandhya): The following transition period (sandhyarsa) is also of the same duration:

9. O Silasana, O man of good holy rites, know that the longevity of the subjects in Krta is four thousand human years:

# Specific Dharmas of Four Yugas

10. When the Krtayuga together with its sandhyarsa passes off, the yuga dharma becomes reduced by a quarter.

11. Krta: Know that Dvapara extends to half of the duration of Krta. Kaliyuga is still half of it.

12. O sage, the Sandhya periods are respectively three hundred, two hundred and one hundred years. The sandhyarsa periods are also the same: The same thing holds good in all the kalpas, and yugas.

13-14. In Krta, the eternal dharma has all the four feet; in Treta it has three feet; it stays on two feet in Dvapara; in Kali, it is devoid of three feet and is stationed by its mere existence. In Krta, the subjects are born in twins; their avocation abounds in taste and happiness.

15. They are always satisfied: They enjoy all pleasures and bliss. There is no inferiority or superiority among them; there are no special characteristics among subjects; they are all auspicious.

16. Longevity, happiness and features among the people in Krta are the same for all; they have no special liking; they have no Dvandvas (mutually opposing pairs), no hatred, no fatigue.

17-19. Those who have no abodes live on mountains and in the oceans: Even then they are devoid of misery. They have mostly sattva guṇas and are mostly isolated. They move about without specific desires; they are perpetually delighted in their minds: They refrain from virtuous and sinful activities.

At that time there was a well-defined arrangement of castes and stages of life; but there was no intermingling of castes: O brahmin, by efflux of time, in Treta yuga their tastes and happiness perish.

20-22. When that Siddhi has perished another is generated: When water attains subtlety it gets transformed into clouds. From the thundering clouds rainfall proceeds. As soon as the surface of the earth comes into contact with rain, trees appear: These trees form their abodes: The subjects have their sustenance and pleasures out of these trees.

23-26. In the beginning of Treta the subjects sustained themselves through them: Then after the lapse of a great deal...

of time, when there was a change, the feeling of lust and covetousness was sudden: The trees which formed their abode began to perish: When they perished the twin-born subjects at that time were bewildered: Thereafter they began to ponder over the matter: Since they were truthful in their thought the trees reappeared:

27-28. They used to produce clothes, fruits and ornaments: On the very same trees honey of great potency but not generated by bees, got evolved in every leafy cup: This honey had great fragrance; good colour and sweet taste. The subjects always sustained themselves thereby and passed their days comfortably at all times:

29. They were delighted and well-nourished: Through this achievement they were free from ailments. Then after the lapse of some time, they became greedy:

30-32. They began to chop off the trees and take the honey forcibly. Due to their misdemeanour as well as their greed the kalpa trees perished in certain places along with honey. As time rolled on only a little of this perfection survived: As Treta was repeated in every cycle the Dvandvas (mutually conflicting pairs) cropped up. Then the subjects became very miserable due to the chilly rain and scorching sun.

33. When they were harassed by Dvandvas they began to make clothes and garments for covering themselves. They made abodes on the mountains in order to ward off Dvandvas:

34. Formerly they roamed about as they pleased: They had no fixed abodes: Now they began to stay in houses in accordance with their availability and pleasure:

35-36. After taking preventive measures against the Dvandvas they began to think about their means of sustenance: When the kalpa trees had perished along with honey, the subjects became confounded and agitated due to disputes. They were harassed by thirst and hunger. Then, in Treta, new perfections came in sight: they desired or needed for production.

37. had more rains than heavy downpour of waters flowed down the slope:

38. Due to continuous rain sources of water currents arose. Thus in the course of second creation of rains, streams and rivers began to function:

39. Small collection of those waters fell on the earth: Due to the mingling of waters and the earth, plants and herbs came into being: and hedges Very

40-41. Then trees grew up. Few of them were cultivated: were not sown. Fourteen types of trees and grasses grew up in the rural and forest areas: They put forth flowers and fruits in accordance with the season. Different types of trees and medicinal herbs also appeared. The subjects sustained themselves with these at that time of Treta:

42. Thereafter the subjects became lustful and greedy in every respect on account of what is destined to happen inevitably in Treta age.

43. Then the subjects forcibly occupied the fields near the rivers and on the mountains: They seized the trees, hedges and herbs as much as they could:

44-45. On account of this perversity the fourteen types of medicinal herbs perished: Thinking that these plants and herbs have entered the earth, Brahma milked the earth assiduously for the welfare of living beings: Ever since, the plants are ploughed by ploughshares here and there.

46. Those who were desirous of sustaining themselves assiduously took to agriculture: The word Varta means avocation and the avocation in this context is the endeavour and desire for agriculture:

47. Otherwise, towards the close of Treta, the subjects have no means of livelihood. Then water has to be lifted by hand in general Treta the subjects fury

48. In that in their seized one another; even their sons, wives, riches etc., forcibly: Such was the characteristic of that yuga.

254. The Puranas divide the vegetation life into three classes, viz. (1) gramya, (2) gramaranye, (3) yejilya (c, Vayu) but this classification is very obscure. Manu classified the plant-world into (1) Vanaspeti (flowers), (2) Vanaspatya (trees bearing fruits and flowers), (3) Ogdhi (plants such as grass) and (4) keta, valli (creepers). Further, Vishnu (cited in ST) mentions fourteen oradhis by name. They are godhums, apu, tile, priyengu, kulitthe, tyamake, nlvdre, jertila, gevedhubsr, Vequyave, and markataks.

Knowing all this, the lotus-born lord created Ksatri- to protect people from wounds and injuries and also for establishing the rules of conduct:

# 50.

Characterised by his own splendour the lord established castes and stages of life: The lord of the universe then created avocation and conduct of life for respective castes of people:

# 51.

The avocation of sacrifices was evolved in Treta gradually. But persons of goodly rites did not resort to animal sacrifice even then:

# 52.

It was then that the seer Vispu performed sacrifices forcefully. That is why the brahmins praise a non-violent sacrifice:

# 53.

In the Dvapara too, men have different inclinations mentally, verbally and physically. It is with great difficulty that agriculture proceeds in that age.

# 54-55.

Then all living beings exert gradually and strain their bodies: Covetousness, service on wage basis, business, fighting, indecision about principles, division of Vedas, confusion of dharmas, destruction of discipline among the four castes and stages of life, lust and hatred—these are the specifics pertaining to that age.

# 56.

It is in this Dvapara that the following begin to function, viz passion, covetousness; arrogance; etc. In the beginnings of Dvapara the Vedas are classified into four by Vyasa:

# 57.

It is laid down that during Treta the Vedas constituted one single whole with four sections: Since the span of life becomes less and less the Vedas are classified in Dvapara.

They are further differentiated through the whims of the sons of sages, when the order of Mantra and Brahmana texts is altered and the accents and letters are changed. The compendiums of Rk Yajus and Samans are compiled by the learned men. Although the texts are common; they are differentiated due to different view-points: viz;

66-70. Absence of rain, death, the harassments of pestilence etc. occur: Indifference to worldly affairs results from various miseries, mental, verbal and physical. From this indifference they begin to think about their liberation from pain and misery. This process of thinking leads to detachment and from detachment they begin to realize the deformities and defects in the world. Thanks to this perception, perfect knowledge becomes possible in Dvapara: This is due to the behavior of mixed rajas and tamas: In the first yuga viz. Krta yuga dharma originates. In Treta it begins to function. In Dvapara it becomes distracted gradually and in Kali it perishes altogether:

# Extent of four Yugas

Indra said:

1. In Kali age men excited by tamoguna adopt Maya (deception) and jealousy: They do not hesitate to kill ascetics: They are always tormented by jealousy.
2. In Kali age there is always carelessness, illness, hunger, fear, and terrible suffering from drought: There is also opposition from and among the different parts of the country:
3. Sruti (i.e. Vedas) is not considered an authority. Men resort to sinful activity. People are sinful, irritable and narrow-minded. They misbehave:
4. Greedy and wicked subjects, born in Kali utter falsehood. They are engaged in evil desires, evil study, misbehaviour and misleading scriptural texts.
5. Due to defects in the activities of the brahmins fear arises in the subjects. The twice-born neglect the study of Vedas and do not sacrifice as prescribed.
6. Men perish: Kshatriyas and Vaisyas decline gradually: In Kali Sudras claim kinship with brahmins through their learning through interdining and sharing seats and beds. Kings become mostly Sudras and they harass brahmins:
7. Killing of foetus and murder of heroes become prevalent: Sudras adopt the conduct of life prescribed for the brahmins and the brahmins adopt the ways of Sudras.
8. Thieves function as kings and kings function as thieves: The chaste ladies cease to exist and wanton sluts increase in number.
9. Stability and discipline of four castes and stages of life disappear from all places. At that time the earth yields very little fruit in one place and great fruits in another:
10. O Silasana, the kings confiscate and misappropriate public property: They cease to be protectors. Sudras acquire knowledge and are honoured by the brahmins:
11. Non-kshatriyas become rulers. Brahmins depend on Sudras: Sudras proud of their intellect remain sitting in their seats and do not stir on seeing brahmins.

13-18 Petty-minded Sudras strike the leading brahmins. Out of humility, brahmins keep their hand over their mouth and whisper into the ears of base Sudras. O noble Brahmins, knowing that Sudras are seated on lofty seats amidst brahmins, the king does not punish them: People of meagre learning, fortune and strength worship Sudras with flowers, scents and other auspicious things. O brahmin, arrogant Sudras do not even glance at the excellent brahmins. Waiting for their opportunity to serve them, the brahmins stand at their thresholds: The brahmins depending upon Sudras serve them when they return seated in their vehicles and eulogise them by means of eulogies and prayers. In Kali, even the excellent brahmins demean themselves by selling the fruits of their austerities and sacrifices.

19-25. In Kali there will be many ascetics. As the yuga draws to a close; men become reduced in number while women increase in proportion: In Kali even the brahmins censure Vedic learning and holy rites. In Kali lord Mahadeva, Sankara, Nilalohita reveals himself as one of deformed features, for the establishment of righteousness: The brahmins who resort to him by any means conquer the evils of Kali and attain the highest abode:

It should be known that towards the close of yuga, the beasts of prey will be very violent. Cows will decline and good men will recede from active spheres. Their Dharma which is subtle, conducive to good results and difficult of access, which has its roots in charitable gifts, becomes shaky due to instability in the four stages of life. The kings misappropriate shares from the oblations offered to God: They do not protect the people: Towards the close of yuga, they will be more interested in protecting themselves. In Kali cooked food will be kept for sale in living places: The selling of Vedas and other sacred literature will occur in cross streets; young women will sell even their honour.

259. Who indulge in the barter of ghee or cooked food. Sivesalahbote who indulge in the sale of Vedas. Catutpethah~brahmins (Medini cited in chastity. ST. Or those who have bartered their muttah. ApagatahrItah: Cf: Vitve cited in ST.

26-31. The lord of rain will be wayward in making showrs at the close of yuga. Merchants will resort to malpractices. They will be surrounded by heretics indulging in vain outward show. There will be many beggars and petitioners among the people soliciting one another; There will be no one not indulging in harsh words; there will not be any straightforward man; there will hardly be anyone who is not jealous; when the yuga comes to close; there will scarcely be any man readily willing to return the help rendered: Fallen people and censurers characteristic this closing period of yuga: The earth will be devoid of kings, riches and foodgrains will not flourish; groups of conspirators will be formed in the cities and countries. The earth will have short supply of water and will be deficient in fruits. Those assigned to be protectors will not be so. They will not be subject to discipline:

32-33. Men will rob others of their wealth and violate the chastity of other men's wives. They will be lustful, wicked at heart; base and foolhardy. They will lose proper perspective of things. Suffering from colic they will have their hairs disheveled. Towards the close of the yuga people will be born whose age will be only sixteen years:

34. When the end of the yuga is imminent Sudras will begin the practice of dharma with white teeth, deerskin and Rudraksa beads, with shaven heads and ochre-coloured robes.

35. Men will steal plants and grains. They will covet the clothes they see; thieves will rob other thieves of their wealth; one robber will rob another. Befitting holy rites are no longer performed; when all the people become inactive and lethargic, germs, mice and serpents will torment men: Prosperity, welfare, health and efficiency will be difficult to attain: People afflicted by hunger and fear will resort to the lands near the KauSiki river.

260. KautikI: It is the modern Kosi that is duct from the Himalayas, flowed through Nepal and Tirhut and joined the Ganges below Patna. But originally the river passed through North Bengal and fell into the Brahmaputra: See Sircer, GAMI Pa 4.

38-39. People overwhelmed by misery will never see the maximum span of life of hundred years. In Kali all the Vedas will not be available: Yajnas perish afflicted by people of no virtue: Ochre-robed and naked anchorites will be wandering and many Kapalikas (ascetics holding skulls in their begging bowls) will infest the territories.

40-41. Some sell Vedas and others sell Tirthas (holy waters) i.e. make illegal gain out of these: When Kali yuga begins, heretics will be born who will be opposed to the system of four castes and stages of life: Sudras will learn the Vedas and will become experts in the meaning of dharma.

42-44. Kings born of Sudra wombs will perform horse-sacrifice: People begin to harass one another by killing women, children, cows and one another: Since people are inclined towards evil, their behaviour will be wrought by tamoguna. At that time the crimes such as the slaughter of a brahmin begin to appear.

45. Hence during Kali, longevity, strength and features become less and less. Men attain perfection within a short while.

46-47. Excellent brahmins of blessed nature will still practice dharma without malice towards the end of Yuga laid down in the Srutis and Smrtis: What is gained by the practice of dharma for a year in Treta is attained by the practice of it for a month in Dvapara. In Kali an intelligent devotee attains the same in a day by practicing Dharma strenuously.

48. This is the state of affairs in the Kali yuga. Understand the situation in the period of ending junction (sandhyamsa) from me: In every yuga the Siddhis are reduced to three-fourths of what they were in the beginning.

49. Only a quarter of the features of the yugas remains in their sandhyas (preceding transition period); similarly only a quarter of the features of the sandhyas abides in the sandhyamsas (succeeding transition periods) (i.e. during the sandhyamsa period only 1/6th of the yuga Dharma will prevail).

50-53. When the yuga has come to a close and the period of junction too has arrived, the chastiser of the wicked people will rise up in order to kill all the bad living beings: He will be born in the family of the Moon. He will be called Pramiti by name: Previously in the Svayambhuva manvantara, he had been born of the parts of Manu (i.e: in the family of then Manu); for full twenty years he will be roaming about on the earth: He will be taking along with him a big army consisting of horses, chariots and elephants. He will be surrounded by hundreds and thousands of brahmins wielding weapons: He will kill the Mlecchas (alien outcaste people) in thousands.

54-55. After killing the kings of Sudra wombs he will exterminate the heretics completely. He will kill those who are not pious and virtuous. He will kill those who are born of different castes and those who depend upon them.

56. Thus making himself powerful with an active army under his control, he the destroyer of the Mlecchas, invincible to all living beings, will roam about the world.

57-58. In the previous birth he was born in the family of Manu who himself was part incarnation of Visnu. When the Kali yuga is complete (i.e. coming to an end) he will be born in the line of the Moon as the powerful Pramiti. He will start his campaign in his thirty-second year and continue it for twenty years.

59. He will be killing hundreds and thousands of beings. By means of this cruel act he will reduce the entire earth to the seeds.

60-69. Getting infuriated mutually (the people will attack one another) Pramiti will defeat all those alien outcastes and all unrighteous persons and ultimately rest in the middle land between the Ganga and Yamuna along with his ministers and followers, after killing all the kings and alien outcastes in thousands. When the sandhyarsa period sets in at the end of the yuga there will be groups of people among the subjects left behind here and there: Getting unrestrained and covetous they will be attacking and killing one another. When anarchy.

# Extent of four Yugas

spreads in view of the series of affairs in the yuga, when people begin to suspect one another, all those people will be afflicted by fear: Agitated and bewildered they will leave off their wives and houses. They will not care even for their own lives: Though themselves miserable yet they will be worthless. When the holy rites laid down in the Srutis and Smrtis perish, these people will attack and kill one another. When Dharma is destroyed they will become mannerless, unbounded, shameless and unloving: They will not hesitate to attack one another. They will be stunted in growth and live as far as twenty-five years.

Getting involved in disputes they will abandon wives and sons. When lack of rain affects them they will abandon agriculture: They will leave off their land and resort to frontiers. They will resort to rivers, oceans, mountains and wells:

In their misery they will sustain themselves on wine, meat; roots and fruits. They will wear barks of trees, leaves or deer skin. They will not perform holy rites or accept monetary gifts. They will fall off from the rigid discipline of four castes and stages of life. They will be involved in a terrible calamity. Thus the few remaining subjects at the end of Kali-yuga will be in miserable circumstances:

They will be afflicted by old age, sickness and hunger: Due to sorrow their minds will become dejected: Through dejection thinking sets in. An even attitude of the mind is what is called vicarana (thinking). This attitude leads to knowledge: Through true knowledge arises pious nature: The subjects who survive the concluding years of Kaliyuga will be devoid of physical features and mental peace:

At that time; the yuga changes for them overnight; after creating illusion in their minds as in the case of a sleeping or mad man. Thanks to the inevitability and force of future events Krtayuga will set in. When thus the Krtayuga is ushered in, the subjects surviving from the Kaliyuga, become those whose span of life extends only to twenty-five years or whose gross and subtle bodies constitute twenty-five tattvas.

Lingapurena belonging to the Krtayuge: Thote Siddhastes (enlightened souls) who still remain and move about invisibly, will be made manifest then along with the sleeping Saptarsis (seven sages).

There will be some brahmins, kshatriyas, vaisyas and Sudras for the purpose of eceds [i.e: as nucleus for the] subsequent generation: They will get mixed with the people surviving from the Kaliyuga. The seven sages and others will teach these people their Dharma.

# 79.

They will teach them the two-fold Dharma of the Sruti and Smriti along with the conduct of life peculiar to the four castes and stages of life:

# 80-83.

Thereafter when they begin to perform holy rites, the subjects flourish in the Krtayuga: have been propounded by the seven sages, other sages promulgate them (among the people) by differentiating them between those pertaining to Sruti and Smriti. Some of these sages stay even at the time of dissolution for the purpose of establishing Dharma. The sages indeed stay in office throughout the manvantara, just as trees remain (unaffected) when the forest fire consumes the grass. But when rain falls this grows up again. In the same manner, after the people of Kali die the people of Krta Yuga come up: The continuity from one yuga to another goes on without break in this manner till the manvantara comes to a close:

# 84.

Happiness, longevity, strength, beauty features, virtue, wealth and love become reduced to three-fourths from yuga to yuga gradually.

The Siddhis of Dharma become (proportionately) Siddhat class of human beings of great purity, divine and divine power. They are said to be seven.

reduced in the part of the junctions of yugas. Thus the mode of achievement in order has been recounted.

# 86-92.

In the same manner all the four yugas must be understood: A thousand such cycles of four yugas are said to constitute one day of Brahma. The night too consists of as many yugas: By the time the yuga comes to a close the living beings lose their straightforward and sentient feelings: This is the characteristic feature of all the yugas. Seventy-one cycles of four yugas constitute a manvantara. What happens in one set of four yugas is repeated in the other cycles of four yugas in the same manner and at the same time as well as in the same order:

The differences that occur from creation to creation are limited to twenty-five, neither more nor less: The kalpas too have the same characteristics as the yugas. The same characteristics mark all the manvantaras also.

# 93.

Just as the changes and alterations in the yugas have happened from early days (and have continued for a long time) in view of the nature of the yugas, so also the world of living beings goes round and round alternating between death and birth:

# 94.

Thus the characteristic feature of the yugas of the past and future in all the manvantaras has been recorded in brief:

# 95.

With the explanation of one manvantara all the manvantaras have been undoubtedly explained; similarly with one kalpa and other kalpas too.

# 96-100.

In regard to the future kalpas the same argument should be continued by one who knows. In all the manvantaras past and future; the eight classes of Devas, the ruling lords of manvantaras, Manus and sages will have the same status through their names and forms, as also the same purpose and intention: The same is the case with the division of castes and stages of life in every Yuga: It is the lord who lays down the nature and characteristics of the yugas, the divisions of castes and stages of life; the yugas and the Siddhis of the yugas. Incidentally, the magnitude of the Yugas was mentioned to you: I shall now recount to you how Brahma the son of the lotus-born deity became the goddess.

# CHAPTER FORTYONE

# Nativity of Brahma

1. When the period of a thousand yugas lapsed and it was morning for him; lord Brahma created once again the subjects who had fallen off, in the same manner as they were before:

2-6. O leading brahmin, when thus the period of twice Parardha lapsed, the earth merged into the water, the water into the fire, the fire into the wind, the wind into the ether along with the tanmatras: O excellent brahmin, eleven sense-organs and the tanmatras merged into the ego in trice. Ego merged into intellect (mahat) in a moment: O brahmin, the intellect also attained the unmanifest (avyakta) and merged into it: The unmanifest became merged into the lord along with its Gunas: Thereafter creation took place as before from Purusa Siva.288 Then the mental sons were created by him by mere thinking:

7-9. The subjects thus created by the lotus-born deity did not flourish in this world: For Brahma performed a penance with the supreme lord in view, in the company of his mental sons. The great lord was pleased by their penance: Realising Brahma's desire, the lord pierced through the middle of Brahma's forehead. Saying 'I am your son' he then became male-cum-female in his form.

10-14. The lord with half-female body became his son. Then the lord burnt Brahma, the preceptor of the universe: Thereafter for the purpose of the flourishing increase of the worlds the lord adopted the yogic path and enjoyed his own prosperous semi-Matra, ParameSvari: He created Visnu and Brahma in her: The lord of the universe, the soul of the universe, created the Pasupata missile too. Hence Visnu and Brahma were born of the part of Mahadevi. Thus Brahma who was the Egg-born; and the lotus-born was born also of the body of the lord.

268. At first there was nothing except Prakrti and Purusa (i.e; Siva and Maya): Then Siva created twenty-five tattvas.

269. Brahma was born of (i) the Cosmic Egg, (ii) the lotus, and (iii) the body of Siva.

Nativity of Brahma

The entire anecdote has been mentioned to you, as also what happened during the first Parardha of Brahma.

# 15-21.

I shall now briefly mention the detachment of Brahma born of tamoguna. Lord Vishnu split his body into two and created a universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings: He then created Brahma who in turn created Rudra: O sage, in another kalpa, Rudra created Brahma. Then O sage, in another kalpa, Vishnu created Brahma, then Brahma created Vishnu, then the lord created Brahma. Then Brahma thought that the world was full of misery and he abandoned the activity of creation. He engaged his soul in the higher soul. He restrained the movement of the vital breaths and remained motionless like a rock: He remained in Samadhi (ecstasy) for ten thousand years: The splendid lotus that faced downwards and was stationed in the heart was filled with inhalation. It became blossomed out. When by means of retention of breath it was restrained that lotus became urdhva-vaktra (with face lifted upwards).

# 22-27.

In the middle of its pericarp he installed the lord: Then Brahma, the self-controlled who had purified his soul by perfect restraint of his senses installed the great lord Shiva in his heart: The lord was situated there in a space as small as the hundred part of the thread of the lotus stalk by repeating 'om' in a series of half measures of time. He who was worthy of worship himself; then by means of flowers of restraint etc. of the Isvara situated in the heart-lotus (of Brahma) the all-born of the body of Bhava came out of Brahma by piercing through his forehead: That lord born from Shiva's heart was blue originally but became red by contact with fire: Because that Purusha was both Nila (blue) and Lohita (red) just like the form of Kala, the God.

Obeisance to you lord Bhava identical with water and taste: Perpetual obeisance to Sarva who has the form of earth and smell; Obeisance to you, Isb, identical with air and the quality of touch: Obeisance to Pafupati the lord of individual souls, identical with fire of excessive splendour: Obeisance to you, Bhima, identical with ether having the quality of sound: Obeisance to Mahadeva, identical with the moon the abode of nectar. Obeisance to You, Ugra, the Yajamana (one who performs sacrifice) who is the agent for all actions.

# 33-34.

He who reads this hymn sung by Brahma unto Rudra, he who listens to this or he who narrates this to brahmins with great concentration will attain identity with the lord of eight cosmic bodies, within a year. After eulogising thus, Brahma looked at the great lord:

# 35-36.

The great lord stood with the eight forms spread all round. The sun shone: So also the fire and the moon. There were earth, wind, water, ether and yajamana—the sacrificer: Ever since that time they call Isvara, Agtamurti.

# 37-38.

Thanks to the grace of Agtamurti; Brahma created again. After creating the world of mobile and immobile beings, he fell asleep for the period of thousand yugas: In the next kalpa when he woke up he became desirous of creating the subjects; and so he performed great and severe penance:

39. Even when he performed the penance thus, nothing happened. After a great deal of time he became miserable and his sorrow turned into anger:

40. When he was overwhelmed with anger, drops of tears fell from his eyes. From those drops of tears goblins and ghosts originated:

41. On seeing this first-born creation consisting of goblins, ghosts and demons; the unborn deity lord Brahma censured himself:

42. Thereupon, the infuriated lord Brahma, abandoned his life: Thereafter, Rudra in the form of Prana (vital breath) appeared through the mouth of lord Brahma.

43. The lord, having a lustre resembling that of the rising sun became Ardhanarisvara (male-cum-female form) - He divided himself into eleven parts and settled down there:

44. With half portion of himself Ardhanarisvara, the soul of all, created Uma. She created Lakshmi, Durga and Sarasvati.

45-48. (She further created) Vama, Raudri, Mahamaya, Vaignavi the lotus-eyed goddess, Kalavikarini, Kali residing in the lotus, goddess Balavikarini; Balapramathini, Sarvabhutatamani, (the suppressor of all living beings,) and Manonmani: Similarly thousands of other women were created by her. Accompanied by those ladies and the Rudras, Mahadeva; Paramesvara the lord of the three worlds stood in front of lord Brahma, Paramesthin who was the soul of all but was now lying dead:

49. Lord Mahesvara, the sympathetic son of Brahma, granted him vital airs:

50. Then Rudra the lord of Devas was delighted and he spoke these pleasant words to Brahma who regained his life:

On hearing his words as though in dreams passing through his mind, Brahma became delighted in his heart. With the vital airs coming back to him, he looked at Mahesvara with his eyes that had the lustre of a full blown lotus. After glancing up at him for a long time, lord Brahma got up and said with palms joined in reverence in a tone affectionate and majestic:

"O highly blessed one; tell me: You are delighting my mind: Who are you standing with eight cosmic bodies and in eleven forms?"

On hearing his words, Mahesvara the slayer of the enemies of Devas spoke through all his mouths:

The lord said: "Know me the great soul and know her the birthless Maya. These standing by are the Rudras, who have come here to protect you."

Thereafter Brahma bowed to the lord of Devas and said with palms joined in reverence: His words were choked with delight: of the chiefs of Devas, agitated and excited due to miseries.

"O Isana, O Sankara, it behoves you to release me from the bondage of worldly existence."

Thereupon the lord of Uma laughed at Brahma. Then the lord of the universe vanished from there along with Uma and the Rudras.

Hence O Silada, understand that in all the worlds it is difficult to get a person who is not born of a womb and who is deathless: Even the lotus-born deity has death: But if Rudra the lord of Devas is pleased; a son not born of a womb and devoid of death is not difficult for you to get. It is not possible for me; for Vishnu and for Brahma to offer you a son not born of a womb and devoid of death.

1. O lord; O Sankara the most excellent among the good, O lord of the chiefs of Devas, O destroyer of Tripuras, I wish for a son not born of a womb and devoid of death.

Suta said:

Rudra, Paramesvara who had already been propitiated by his penance by Brahma spoke thus again to Silada with very great pleasure:

The lord said:

O brahmin, O ascetic, formerly I had been propitiated by Brahma, sages and Devas by penance, for the sake of my incarnation:
I shall become your son, not born of a womb; by the name Nandin. O sage, I am the father of worlds and you will become my father:
After saying thus to the sage who was standing there after bowing to him and looking up to him, the delighted merciful lord who was accompanied by Uma and who was comparable to the Moon vanished there itself.

O great sage, having obtained the assurance of a son from Rudra, my father was delighted. He was the most excellent among the knowers of sacrifice: For the purpose of sacrifice he came to the courtyard of a great sacrificial chamber. Formerly I was born in that courtyard as his son, at the behest of lord Siva. I had the lustre of fire at the closing of yuga.
When I was born as the son of Silada, the clouds Puskara, Avartaka and others showered rain. The heaven-walkers—Kinnaras, Sadhyas and Siddhas sang songs. Vignu showered fragrant flowers:

I had then the lustre at the time of pralaya or dissolution. I was having matted hair and coronet: In the form of an infant I had three eyes, four arms holding the trident, axe, iron club and thunderbolt: My curved fangs were adamantine: I was the infant adored by the thunderbolt-wielding Indra. I was terrible in appearance with diamond earrings. My voice was comparable to the thundering sound of.

The following stood all around me: Brahma, Visnu, Rudra, Indra, Siva, Ambika herself, Jupiter, the moon, the sun of great splendour, wind god, fire god, Isana, Nirrti, Yaksa, Yama, Varuna, Visve Devas, Rudras, Vasus of great strength, Laksmi herself, Saci, Jyestha, goddess Sarasvati; Aditi, Diti, Sraddha, Lajja, Dhrti, Nanda, Bhadra, Surabhi, Susila, Sumanas; the lord of bulls, Dharma of great splendour and the sons of Dharma. They surrounded me, embraced me and eulogised me: 0 excellent sage, even Silada my father, the sage, on seeing me like that bowed to me with love: The meritorious soul eulogised his son who gave him what he liked.

Silada said:

26-31. 0 lord, 0 lord of the chief of Devas, 0 three-eyed one, 0 unchanging one, you are my son since you are my protector and the protector of worlds from misery: Since you are the protector of worlds, O son, you are my father. You are omnipresent: 0 son, not born of a womb, obeisance to you, 0 source of origin of the universe; 0 grand father, 0 father, 0 son, 0 Mahesana, 0 preceptor of the universe, 0 dear one, O highly blessed one, 0 Paramesvara protect me: 0 lord of Devas, since I am delighted by you, you are to be known by the name Nandin. Hence 0 Nandin, delight me: I bow down to you, the lord of the universe. 0 lord delight my parents who have gone to Rudra's world: 0 lord, my grandfather too has gone to the world of Rudra. 0 Nandin, when Mahesvara has incarnated my birth in the world is fruitful: 0 lord, the birth of the worlds too is fruitful.

preceptor of the worlds, O dear one; please forgive what was said by me considering you as my son. You are worthy of being culogised by means of hymns by Devas and Asuras. Whoever reads or listens to this speech addressed to my son; whoever narrates this to brahmins with devotion, rejoices along with me: After culogising the boy his son, after bowing down to him with respect and looking at the leading sages, Silada of good holy rites said: unchanging ye sages, see my great fortune, since the lord has incarnated as Nandin in the courtyard of the sacrificial hall. Which man is like me in this world? Neither Devas nor Danavas are equal to me since this Nandin is born in the sacrificial ground for the sake of my welfare:

# CHAPTER FORTYTHREE

# Coronation of Nandisvara

Nandisvara said:

After bowing down to Mahesvara, my delighted father immediately went back to his hut along with me like an indigent man after obtaining a treasure-trove.

O great sage, when I went to the hut of Silada I eschewed my divine form and assumed human shape:

My divine memory was obliterated for some unknown reason. On seeing that I had assumed human form, my father, worshipped by all the worlds, became extremely miserable and he lamented. Surrounded by his kinsmen, he, the knower of everything; performed my postnatal and other holy rites.

Silada son of Salankayana was highly fond of me his son. It was he who taught me all these: viz, the recensions of Rgveda, Yajurveda and the thousand branches of Samaveda with their ancillaries and subdivisions: He taught me Ayurveda (science of medicine), Dhanurveda (science of archery), Gandharva (musicology), Asvalaksana (characteristics of horses), the details of elephants and also the characteristics...

Coronation of Nandifoara
# 173

stics of men: When I completed my seventh year two excellent divine sages Mitra and Varuna, who were equipped with penance, and yogic Power came to his hermitage to see me. It was at the behest of the lord that they had come there:

# 9-1.

On seeing me repeatedly the two noble sages said: So dear one, though this Nandin has mastered all the scriptural topics, he is short-lived: This type of wonder has not been seen before: His life does not extend beyond a year.

When they said thus Silada the leading brahmin, extremely fond of his son, embraced me: Excessively dejected he lamented with a highly discordant voice; "Alas my son! my son, my son!" He then fell down flat.

# 12-13.

He was sad and he said: "Alas! the power of the adverse fate and of the creator!" On hearing his lamentation the residents of the hermitage gathered there in great bewilderment. They evolved amulets and observed auspicious rites to ward off the evil: They cajoled Mahadeva, the three-eyed lord of Uma.

# 14.

They performed homa repeating the mantra of Triyambaka, offering ten thousand times Durva (Darbha grass) soaked in honey, and accompanied by other materials of worship: My father and grandfather lost consciousness. With all their activities ceased, they lamented, fell down as though dead.

# 15.

I was afraid of death: Ere long I bowed down to my father and grandfather who were lying down as though they were dead. I circumambulated them: I was then engaged in the repetition of Rudra mantra. I meditated on the three-eyed lord in the lotus cavity of my heart, the quiescent lord Sadasiva with ten arms and five faces: Even as I was standing in the middle of the holy river the delighted lord Mahadeva accompanied by Uma, and adorned by the crescent moon appeared and said: "O dear Nandin of greater arms, whence is fear from death for you?"

# 20-24.

Those two brahmins had been sent by me alone: There is no doubt that you are like myself: O dear, this body of yours is factually worldly. It is not divine: O dear, what was formerly seen and worshipped by Silada, Devas, sages, Siddhas, Gandharvas and Danavas was divine: O Nandisvara:

# Lingepurana

This is the nature of the world that happiness and misery befall repeatedly one after the other: It is the duty of the discriminating man to avoid birth through the womb. After saying thus to me, Paramesvara, lord Rudra, Hara, the great lord of all Devas, the destroyer of distress touched me with his splendid hands:

# 25-28.

After glancing at the goddess, Uma the daughter of the Himavat; and at the chieftains of the Ganas, the bull-emblemed Mahadeva, Lord of Devas, said with satisfaction in his heart; "Along with your father and friends you will be unaging and devoid of pain and misery. You will be deathless, imperishable and unchanging: You will have my virility and exploit: You will be my favourite chief of Ganas. I will be always fond of you: You will be at my side forever: You will have my strength: You will be endowed with great yogic power."

# 29-31.

After saying this to me, the lord accompanied by his attendants, took off his lotus garland: The bull-emblemed lord of great splendour tied it on me: With that splendid garland clinging to my neck I became as though a second Sankara with three eyes and ten arms. Then Paramesvara took me by the hand and said, "Tell me: What excellent boon shall I give you now?" The bull-emblemed lord then took the pure water embedded in his matted hairs. Saying, "Be a river," he cast it down: Then it began to flow as a great river full of splendid, divine, white (shining) water with lots of lotuses and lilies in it. Mahadeva said to that extremely splendid river, "Since you began to flow as a great river from the waters of my matted hairs you will be an excellent holy river named Jatodaka."

# 36-39.

Any man will be liberated from all sins by taking bath in you. Then lord Mahadeva said to the goddess, "This is your son" and made me the son of Silada, falling at her feet: She kissed me on the head and stroked me with her hands. With three pourings of water as white as the conch, with three sons she bathed me with the affection due to a son all the while glancing at the lord of Devas. These three pourings of water signify release from the bondage of Birth and Death, which is the goal of man's life. According to ST, yoni-parityageh = stri-Jamagama-tyagah. ST cites Bhagaveta in support of this meaning:

Coronation of NandiSvara
ings Aowed down to become river with three branches: The lord Bhava therefore called it Trisrotas (river with three tributaries) the bull (vehicle of Siva) was extremely delighted. It bellowed: From that bellowing sound another river originated. That river was called "Vreadhvani" by the lord of Devas: The bull-emblemed lord placed on my head his divine golden crown that was made by Visvakarman, studded with all jewels, and that was variegated auspicious and wonderful, Mahadeva, Mahesvara himself fitted in my ears his splendid divine ear-rings bedecked with diamonds and Lapis Lazuli.

On seeing me honoured thus, the sun in the sky showered Siladana with waters from the clouds. When he was thus showered; those waters flowed as a stream. Since this river originated from gold, the three-eyed lord of Devas called her Svarnodaka. Since another splendid river originated from the crown made of gold they call that river Jambunadi: Thus the set of five rivers flowed near the lord Japyesvara:

He who visits Pancanada; takes the holy dip there and worships Lord Japyesvara shall undoubtedly attain identity with Siva:

Then lord Mahadeva, Bhava, the lord of all beings said to goddess Sarvani, Uma, the unborn; and daughter of the mountain:

0 goddess, I am going to crown lord Nandisvara as the lord of goblins I shall call him the leader of the Ganas. 0 unchanging goddess, what do you think?

On hearing his words the delight of Bhavani was evident in her face: Smilingly she said to Bhava her lord, the lord of goblins, and the bestower of boons; "0 lord of Devas, it behoves you to grant him the overlordship of the worlds as also the leadership of the Ganas, Sailadi is my own son:"

Thereafter lord Sarva, the lord of the chiefs of the world, the bull-emblemed lord, remembered all the divine chiefs of the Ganas:

Pancanadam confuence of five rivers, viz. Jetodaks, Trisrotas, Vreadhvani, Svarnodaka, and Jambunadi:

# Coronation of Nandifvara

Sailidi said:

1. As soon as Rudra remembered them, the leaders of Ganas came there: All of them had thousand arms with weapons in all their thousand hands:

2. They had three eyes. These noble ganas were saluted even by Deves. They resembled crores of fires that burn at the time of dissolution. They had matted hairs and crowns.

3. Innumerable lords of Ganas of noble souls came there with jubilation: They were accompanied by crores and crores of Ganas all equal in exploits to the chief. Their faces were terrible due to the curved fangs: They were eternal, enlightened and devoid of impurities singing, running, dancing.

4. Those strong ones were playing on various instruments with facial gestures:

5. These Ganas rode in chariots, on elephants, horses, lions and monkeys. They were seated in aerial chariots decorated in gold. The Ganas of great yogic power came to the assembly of the lord, playing on drums and other musical instruments such as Bheri, Mrdangaka, Panava, Anaka, Gomukha, Pataha, Ekapuekara, Adambaraka, Muraja, Dindima, Mardala, Venu (Bute), Vina (lute), different kinds of cymbals, Dardura; Talaghata, Kacchapa and Panava.

6-8. Those lords of Ganas of great strength and stamina, the lords of the chiefs of Devas bowed down to the lord and the goddess and spoke these words:

9. O blessed lord, O lord of the chiefs, three-eyed lord, O bull-emblemed lord, why are we summoned? O lord of great splendour, command us.

10. Shall we dry up the Oceans? Shall we kill Yama along with his servants? Shall we kill Mrtyu, the daughter of God of Death? Shall we kill the lotus-born deity as an insignificant animal? Infuriated that we are, shall we bind up Indra along with Daityas along with Devas or Vayu or Danavas and bring them here?

13. Olord; at your behest, to whom shall we bring about destruction and distress today? Who has great festivities today for the prosperity and increase of his desires?

14. The lord honoured crores and hundred crores of those chieftains of Ganas: Even as they earnestly spoke to him thus, he replied as follows: striving for the welfare of the universe. Listen why you have been called: O noble ones of pure souls; On hearing it do accordingly without hesitation:

15. This Nandisvara is Our son. He is the lord of all chiefs: He is prosperous brahmin, your leader and commander-in-chief: bidding, you all, highly respected ones,

16. Hence at my command crown him as your lord as the great lord of yogas.

17. Thus directed by the lord, the chieftains of the Ganas agreed to the same, by saying "so be it" and thereafter began to gather all the requisites of Sarva, the

18-23. They brought the usual divine seat, a splendid seat made of gold, the beautiful one resembling Meru to be offered as a seat for him (Nandin). They made a Mandapa with many pillars shining with golden lustre: Pearl pendants were suspended and they were studded with gems and jewels. There were columns of Lapis Lazuli covered with small tinkling bells. The Mandapa had doors on all sides bedecked in beautiful gems and jewels. After making the Mandapa they placed a splendid seat in the middle: In front of it was the foot-stool shining with blue stones. For the installation of the pedestal they kept two water jars nearby: They were filled with sweet waters and covered with lotus flowers:

24. There were a thousand jars of gold, silver, copper and clay. They were filled with waters from all Tirthas.

25-26. Brahma; Paramesthin the noble soul, offered these things, viz; a pair of cloths, divine scents, shoulderlets; earrings, crown, necklace, hundred-ribbed umbrella and the chowrics. fine Camara (bushy tail of deer used as a fan) with gold shaft: The fan was as pure as the moon. It shone with its back as white as conch or pearl.

28. The divine elephants Airavata and Supratika were fully caparisoned. A gold crown was made by Visvakarman.

29-30. There were two pure and divine ear-rings. The excellent weapon thunderbolt was kept there: There was a golden thread and two bracelets. The unexcited leaders of Ganas, highly honoured by Devas, brought many requisite materials from all round.

31-34. Then all these assembled there joyously: Devas along with Indra, Visnu and others, the sages, Brahma and nine Brahmas?79. When all of them had come, lord Paramesvara directed Brahma to perform the rite: At the behest of the lord, Brahma performed the rite of ablution with great attention. After worshipping him, Brahma himself poured the water. At the behest of Siva, Visnu, Indra and the guardians of quarters bathed the leaders of Ganas in succession.

36-37. The sages with Brahma at their head eulogised him. While they eulogised, Visnu, the lord of the universe, kept his joined palms over the head and eulogised with great attention. With palms joined in reverence, he bowed down and cried out shouts of victory: Ganas;

38-39. Then the commandants of Devas and Asuras, one after the other, eulogised and bathed him. Thus, after being eulogised and bathed by Devas along with Brahma, his marriage too was performed at the behest of Paramesthin. His wife was the gentle lady named Suyasa, the daughter of the Maruts:

40-41. A well-decorated umbrella having the lustre of the moon was offered to her. She had Camaras also and she was accompanied by groups of women holding Camara in their hands. Along with me, the most excellent throne was occupied by her: She was adorned by Mahalakshmi with coronet and other ornaments.

46-49. At the behest of the lord, the husband of the daughter of the mountain, Nandi granted those who deserved the splendid behest of the lord. On receiving the order from the leading sage they became great devotees of Siva. Hence one should worship the lord.

If a person utters the name of the lord without obeisance he will incur great sin on a par with that of ten brahmin-slayers. Hence by all means, one shall utter words of obeisance: At the outset one shall make obeisance and at the end utter the name Siva.

# 5.

Those who are confounded, those who are deluded by his Maya do not know the great lord Mahesvara the noble soul, the Atman of all.

# 6.

Indeed the three worlds constitute his body. Hence after bowing to him, I shall recount the splendid detail of the worlds. Formerly, I had mentioned to you about the shape and features of the Cosmic Egg: I shall now describe the features of the worlds in the cosmic Egg.

# 7.

The Earth, the firmament, Svah, Mahah, Jana; Tapas and Satya - these seven are the splendid worlds originating from the Cosmic Egg.

# 8.

O brahmins, beneath these are the seven worlds beginning with Mahatala. Beneath them are the hells one by one:

Mahatala has the golden ground surface, which is rendered splendid by jewels, mansions and shrines dedicated to lord Siva. It is occupied by Ananta, Mucukunda and Bali who is the resident of Patala and Svarga.

# 10.

O brahmins, Rasatala is rocky, Talatala is full of gravels, Sutala is yellow and Vitala has the lustre of coral.

# 11-15.

Atala is white. Tala is black: O men of good holy rites, the extent of all the Talas below is as much as that of the earth, viz, 1000 yojanas each: The sky above each Tala extends to ten thousand yojanas. The magnitude of all the seven along with the clouds is seven thousand lakhs of yojanas. The root (i.e: the space below the last world Patala) is thirty thousand yojanas. O excellent sages, the splendid Rasatala is frequented by Suvarna, Vasuki and by others as well.

The Earth consists of seven continents;281 It is full of rivers and mountains. It is surrounded by seven oceans all round and embellished by them.

The seven continents beginning with the inner one are Jambu, Plaksa, Salmali, Kusa, Kraunca, Saka and Puskara.

Lord Siva is present in all the seven continents, accompanied by Uma (his consort), surrounded by the Ganas, and assuming different guises.

The seven oceans in order are those having, (1) briny water, (2) sugarcane juice, (3) wine; (4) ghee, (5) curds, (6) milk and (7) sweet water. In all these oceans the glorious lord Siva assumes the form of water and sports with the waves along with the Ganas.

Lord Vienu always sleeps in yogic slumber in the milky ocean though he were the nectar from that, with his intellect concentrated on the knowledge of Siva.

# 7.

When the lord wakes up, the entire universe wakes up; when he is asleep it is also asleep; the mobile and immobile beings are identical with him.

# 8.

With the favour of Paramesthin lord of Devas, everything was created; held, protected and annihilated by him alone.

# 9.

O excellent sages, those who are well known as susenas worship Aniruddha the leading Purusa holding conch, discus and iron club.

# 10-14.

O sages, most excellent among the knowers of Atman, those who meditate on Aniruddha Purusa are all similar to Vignu and become endowed with all riches. Sanandana, Sanaka, Sanatana, Valakhilyas, Siddhas, Mitra and Varuna these all worship Visnu who is the origin of the universe: In all the seven continents there are lofty mountains, some rising to great heights, some extending as far as the oceans, others having many peaks and caves. There were many kings in these continents who were overlords and who ruled with efficiency according to the demands of the period. They were powerful, thanks to the lord (Siva), the father of the enemy of Kraunca (i.e. Karttikeya).

# 15-18.

I shall mention the kings in all the manvantaras past and future; beginning with those in the Svayambhuva manvantara. The grandsons of Svayambhuva Manu were all very strong, with similar status, honour and identical purposes. They were the heroic sons of Priyavrata and they are reputed to be ten, viz, Agnidhra, Agnibihu, Medha, Medhatithi, Vasu, Jyotisman, Dyutiman, Havya, Savana and Putra: Priyavrata crowned seven of them as kings over the seven continents.

283. Krauncirih the enemy of Kraudca, i.e. Karttikeya, so called because he split the Himalya range Kraunce, situated in the eastern part of the chain on the north of Astam.

285. Though the number is the same, their names differ in the Puranas.

Delpas and heir Lords
19-24. He made Agnidhra the lord of Jambudvipa and Medhatithi the king of Plakeadvipa: Vapus king crowned Isman the of Salmali, Jyotisman the king of Kusadvipa; Dyutiman the king of Krauicadvipa, Havya the lord of Sakadvipa. O sages of good holy rites, he made Savana the overlord of Puskara. Savana had two sons Mahavira and Dhataki. They were most excellent that men could have: The kingdom of Mahavira is known as Mahavira Varsa after the name of that noble soul. The kingdom of Dhataki is called Dhatakikhanda.

25. Havya the lord of Sakadvipa procreated seven sons. They were Jalada, Kumara, Sukumara, Manicaka, Kusumottara, Modaki and Mahadruma.

26-29. The Varea continent of Talada is called (1) Tala- the Varsa of Kumara is called (2) Kaumara; that of Sukumara is glorified as (3) Sukumara; the Varsa of Manicaka is called (4) Manicaka; the Varsa of Kusumottara is (5) Kusumottara, the Varsa of Modaki is glorified as (6) Modaka; after the name of Mahadruma, the next Varga is (7) Mahadruma; all the seven Varzas are thus named after their rulers:

30-34. Dyutiman, the lord of Krauica Dvipa had seven sons named Kusala, Manuga, Uspa, Pivara, Andhakaraka, Muni and Dundubhi who had splendid sub-continents named after them, in the Kraufca Dvipa. The sub-continent of Kusala is Kusala; that of Manuga is Manonuga; that of Uspa is Usna; that of Pivara is Pivara; the land of Andhakara is Andhakaraka; the land of Muni is called Muni and that of Dundubhi is Dundubhi. These seven shining countries are in Krauiica Dvipa.

In the Kusadvipa, Jyotisman had seven powerful sons.

35. They were Udbhida, Venuman, Dvairatha, Lavana, Dhrti, Prabhakara and Kapila. Udbhida; the second is Venu-

various countries of Salmali Dvipa. They were Sveta, Harita, Jimuta, Rohita, Vaidyuta, Manasa and Suprabha; The land of Sveta is Sveta; that of Harita, Harita; that of Jimuta is Jimuta; that of Rohita is Rohita; that of Vaidyuta is Vaidyuta; that of Manasa is Manasa and that of Suprabha is Suprabha; thus there are seven countries marked after the names of their rulers: I shall mention the divisions in the Plaksadvipa that is beyond Jambudvipa:

Medhatithi had seven sons; they were the kings of Plaksa Dvipa which consists of seven Varsas. The eldest among the sons was Santabhaya. After him were Sisira; Sukhodaya, Ananda; Siva, Kgemaka and Dhruva. The continent was divided into seven Vargas and named after these sons: Formerly in the Svayambhuva manvantara these Varsas were colonised by them: Subjects endowed with the discipline of four castes and four stages of life were colonised in the Varsas by those sons of Medhatithi, the residents of Plaksadvipa.

In the five continents beginning with Plaksadvipa and ending with Sakadvipa, the Dharma was promulgated in accordance with the division of four castes and four stages of life: O excellent brahmins in these five Dvipas; happiness, span of life, handsome features, strength and Dharma were their individual characteristics respectively.

The characteristic common to all the five continents was that the subjects there were all perpetually engaged in the worship of Rudra and devoted to Mahesvara: The kings born in the Pugkaradvipa enjoy the nectar of their devout feelings towards Prajapati and Rudra:

Bhrata sub-continent
1. Leading brahmins, he was an ascetic and great devotee of Siva. He was a young man engaged in the worship of Siva. He was prosperous and intelligent and he possessed many cows.

2. He had nine sons at par. All of them were followers of Mahesvara and devoted to Mahadeva:

- 3. His eldest son was known as Nabhi. Kimpurusa was his (Nabhi's) younger brother. The third son was Harivarea; the fourth son was Ilavta.
- 5. Ramya was the fifth; the sixth was Hiranman. Kuru was the seventh. Bhadrasva was the eighth.
- 6. The ninth was Ketumala. Understand their lands now.

The subcontinent of Nabhi inherited from his father is called Hema which lies in the south:

- 7. He gave Kimpurusa the subcontinent Hemakuta. He gave the subcontinent called Naigadha to Hari.
- 8. To Ilavrta he gave the midlands encircling the mountain Meru; he gave Ramya the subcontinent around Nilacala.
- 9. The subcontinent Sveta to the north of it was given to Hiranman; he gave Kuru the subcontinent Srnga Varea which is to the north of it.
- 10. He gave the subcontinent round about Milyavan to Bhadrasva. He gave Gandhamadana to Ketumala.

11-12. These are the nine great subcontinents. After crowning his sons as the kings in those subcontinents, Agnidhra engaged in penance: After purifying himself by penance he became engaged in the study of the Vedas:

13-15. After being engaged in the study of the Vedas he became engaged in meditation on Siva. There is natural perfection in all the eight excellent subcontinents beginning with Kimpurusa. Without any strain the subjects are always happy. The opposite of joy is not seen in them: They have no fear from death or old age. They have neither Dharma nor Adharma. There is no distinction such as the excellent, the middling and the base: In all these eight subcontinents there are no subdivisions of yugas.

288. According to Litga, Agnidhra was the eldest son of Hiyevats: But according to Veyu version he was the son of Priyavrata's daughter.

16. Those who die in the holy centre of Rudra, whether mobile or immobile, whether devotees or casual visitors, are reborn there: their benefit is eight holy centres.

17. For these were created by Rudra: In all those places Mahadeva was always present.

18. By seeing Mahadeva in their hearts, the residents of the eight holy centres were always happy: He alone was the greatest goal unto them all: the country of Nabhi marked by 'hima' (snow; i.e: Bharatavarsa as mentioned below).

19-20. I shall now recount the intelligent Nabhi, who begot a son of Merudevi, Rsabha by name, who was a great king adored by all ksatriyas: A heroic son Bharata was born to Rsabha: He was the eldest among his hundred sons.

21-25. Rsabha, who was fond of his son Bharata, crowned him as king: By adopting the path of knowledge and detachment, he conquered the serpents of his sense-organs; by all means he stabilised Isvara, the supreme Atman, within his own heart; he was immersed in devout feelings; he observed fasts; he wore bark garments and matted hair: He retired into darkness (i.e: solitary place). Devoid of all desires and his doubts all cleared, (in the end) he attained the great region of Siva. He gave the subcontinent to the south of the mountain Himavat to Bharata. Hence learned men call that subcontinent Bharata Varsa after his name. Bharata's son was the virtuous Sumati. Bharata entrusted the kingdom to his care: After transferring the royal glory to his son, the king entered the forest for penance.

289. Linga ascribes the origin of the name to King Bharate, the eldest of the hundred sons of Rsabha and grandson of Nabhi: Cf, Vayu 33. 51-52; Marka 53. 39-40. For detail see Bhiga [4. [5-17 and Sk [. 37. 55-57. But according to Matsya 114-5-6, Bharata is the name of Manu himself who creates and supports the people here. For further detail, see Avasthi Studies in Skandapurana, PP. 17-23. Formerly Bharata was known as Hima-varva or Haimavata Varsa.

Roll to and fro due to intoxication: The Apsaras (water nymphs) move about all round: There are wonderful lakes, tanks, and rivers, all clustered with full blown lotuses. They have golden lines of steps. Even the sands on their banks are golden: Blue and fragrant golden lotuses abound in them. Thus the whole city shines splendidly: With that city the mountain is considered auspicious.

In the south-eastern side of the mountain is the city of the fire god. It is divine and similar to Amaravati: It is endowed with all means of pleasures:

O sages, most excellent among those who have self-control, in the southern side of the mountain is the city of Yama Vaivasvata: It is full of many divine abodes built in gold and very splendid:

In the south-west is the splendid dark-coloured Suddhavati. Similarly in the north-west is the splendid city Gandhavati: The city in the north is Mahodaya and that in the north-east is Yasovati: Thus cities in all the quarters always shine.

There are the abodes of Brahma, Visnu and Mahesa as well as of others on it: Thus the mountain endowed with all means of pleasures and containing many lakes, is the most excellent among the mountains.

It is full of Siddhas, Yaksas, Gandharvas, sages and the four kinds of living beings.

O leading brahmins, on the mountain towards the left, stands a palace of seven storeys that is as clear as pure crystal.

The river Jambut flows round the base of this mountain. Splendid Jambu (Rose Apple) tree: To its right there is a very tall tree with extensive growth all round: It yields fruits at all times: The Ilavrta sub-continent is splendid and extensive all round the Meru. Some subsist there on the fruit of Jambu and some on nectar: Some have the lustre of gold and others are of various colours. They enjoy all kinds of pleasures: O brahmins, this is the splendid mid-land of the Dvipa, which extends all round the foot of the Meru: There are nine sub-continents in Jambudvipa. I shall recount all of them with their rivers, streams, and mountain ranges. Understand their extent in yojanas.

292. Jambu According to Marka: (55. 28-30) this river springs from the juice of the fruit which the Jambu tree produces on the Gandhamadans.

28. Jambudvipa represents the geographical conception of the territory ruled over by the Aryan people: The territory is divided into nine uio (veraces) of which Bharata was one. St. Epiphanjus (the end of the fourth century A.D.) has recorded that India formerly divided into nine kingdoms (vide B. Ghaudhuri, JIH. Vol. XXVII part III, 1949, PP: 241).

# CHAPTER FORTYNINE

# Ilavrta sub-continent

Snta said :

1. The first Dvipa, it is said, extends to thousand yojanas: The other Dvipas successively extend to twice the previous one.
2. The earth along with all the oceans is stated as extending to fifty crores of yojanas. It consists of seven Dvipas: It is splendid and is surrounded by the Lokaloka mountain.
3. The mountain Nila is to the north of the Meru: The Sveta is to the north of this and the Srngi is still further north of Sveta. Brahmins, these three are the mountains of the sub-continents in the north:
4. The Jathara and the Devakuta are the mountains in the eastern quarter. The Nisadha is to the south of the Meru. Still south of it is the mountain Hemakuta. The Himavat is to its south.
5. To the west of the Meru there are two mountains: Mal and Gandhamadana. These two extend towards the north:

299. Lokaloka a belt of mountains bounding the outer-most of the seven Dvipas and dividing the visible world from the regions of darkness.

294-295. On the eastern side of Meru there are two mountains, namely the Jetbara and the Devakita which run north to south and stretch up to the Nila (Tien Shan) and Nisadha mountains (Voyu 35.8). Jathara is identified with Kuruk-Tegh and Devekuta with Altin Tagh-Nep Shan Tsing-Ling of Sinkiang and Northern China. The Geography of the Puranas, PP: 99-100.

296. Nisadha: Sp. places it to the south of the Meru, along with the Himavat and Hemakuta. It represents Hindukush Kunlun chain.

# Ilavrta sub-continent

6. All these leading mountains are frequented by the Siddhas and Caranas. The inter-space between two mountains is nine thousand yojanas in each case:

7-10. This sub-continent south of the Himavat is known as Bharata. Hemakuta is beyond that: The sub-continent within it is Kimpurusa: Nigadha is beyond Hemakuta. Its sub-continent is called Harivarsa. Beyond Harivarsa and Meru is the splendid Ilavta. Beyond Ilavrta is Nila and the sub-continent Ramyaka. Beyond Ramyaka is Sveta and the sub-continent known as Hiranmaya. The mountain beyond Hiranmaya is known as Srngi and the sub-continent beyond it is Kuru. The two Varsas one in the south and one in the north (i.e: Himavarsa and Ramyaka) are stationed like an arch. The other four are horizontal in shape: Ilavrta is in the middle; to the west and east of the Meru there are two sub-continents and they are smaller (than the four mentioned before): above Nisadha is the area known as the northern Vedyardha (half of the whole Dvipa which is conceived as a sacrificial altar). Thus there are three Varsas in the southern half and three Varsas in the northern half:

13. Ilavrta with the Meru in the middle is in the midst of the two halves.

14-15. The great mountain Malyavan extends towards the north. Its width above is two thousand yojanas. Its length is stated to be thirty-four thousand yojanas. The mountain Gandhamadana is to the west of it.

16-17. Its length and width is similar to that of Malyavan: These six Varsa mountains of good ridges extend to the east and are bounded on both sides by the Eastern and Western seas.

18. Himavat is full of snow. The Hemakuta contains gold. The Nisadha is also golden resembling the morning sun.

19. The golden Meru which extends upwards has four colours. Its girth is symmetrical and cylindrical. It rises high.

Thus the mountains have been succinctly recounted: Again listen to the description of the leading hills or peaks. Mandara and Devakuta are the mountains in the eastern quarter. Kailasa and golden Gandhamadana extend from the east towards south and end within the Ocean: The excellent mountains Nisadha and Pariyatra are stationed in the west; like those in the east: Trifrnga and Jarudhi are the excellent mountains in the north: They are embedded within the ocean and they also extend towards the East. Learned men call these mountains "Maryadaparvatas" (mountains of the boundary):

# 25b-27.

O excellent brahmins there are foot ranges to the lofty golden mountain Meru, extending to the four quarters. Supported by these, the earth consisting of the seven Dvipas, does not move: Their length is mentioned to be ten thousand yojanas: In the east it is Mandara; in the south it is Gandhamadana, in the west it is Vipula and in the north it is Suparsva:

# 28-34.

Four lofty trees grow on these as though they are the fagstaffs of the Dvipas: The great tree on the peak of the mountain Mandara is the Kadamba, the king of fagstaffs. It has long hanging branches. It acts as a caityapadapa (holy big tree in sacred temple). On the peak of the mountain in south (i.e Gandhamadana) there is a Jambu tree (Rose Apple) with holy fruits and flowers hanging in garlands. The Jambu tree is known in all the worlds as the fagstaff in the southern region. On the peak of the lofty mountain Vipula, in the west, a great Asvattha tree (holy fig tree) grows like a great Caityapadapa (a sacred tree in holy temple). On the peak of the mountain Suparsva in the north grows the big Nyagrodha (Indian fig tree), with huge trunk extending to many yojanas in circumference.

# 35-57.

I shall now mention the four sporting grounds of Devas on the leading mountains: They are devoid of human beings and have trees and plants that bloom in all the seasons:

There are groves in the four directions. Understand them by their names. The forest grove in the east is Caitraratha; in the south it is Gandhamadana; it is Vaibhraja in the west; in the north it is the garden of Savity (sun): (The holy shrine) in the east is MitrcSvara:

# CHAPTER FIFTY

# The abodes of Devas

Sita said:

1. Indra stays in the auspicious forest of Parijata (wish-yielding tree) on the peak called Sitanta of Kumuda.
2. To the east of it is the extensive peak mountain. O excellent brahmins, on it are the eight cities of Danavas. In the holy Suvarnakotara, O excellent brahmins, they say, are the sixty-eight cities of the noble-souled Raksasas called Nilakas.
3. There are fifteen cities on the Mahanila which are the abodes of the horse-faced Kinnaras.
4. O men of holy rites, there are three cities of the good Vidyadharas on Venusaudha, the great mountain.
5. The glorious Garuda stays in Vaikuntha. The prosperous Nilalohita stays in Karanja. The Vasus live in Vasudhara.

302. Parijata-vana - forest of coral trees (Erythrina Indica) which lose their leaves in June and are then covered with large crimson flowers.

303. Sitanta - It means 'end of cold' i.e. 'range which marks the dividing line between the cold and hot regions.' If the river Kizil-Su represents the head waters of the Puranic river Sita, Sitanta is obviously the Kashghar range, i.e. the last longitudinal range of the Pamir region facing the Terim basin. On the east, it is a range which, to a traveller coming from the east across the hot and sandy Tarim Basin, stands athwart the route towards the west and promises a cool climate beyond. It is an effective climatic barrier which separates a hot and dry desert on the east from the cold plateau on the west. Coming from the west, it literally marks the 'end of cold' and is therefore rightly qualified for its name, Sitanta." GP. PP. 100-101.

304. Kumuda - Peak Barzengi (16,456 feet) beyond the Pakshif Pass. Most of the mountains mentioned in this chapter are not identifiable.

In these also Lord Siva, assuming hundreds of forms, sports about along with Uma and the Ganas. It is called Sivalaya (abode of Siva). Thus there are hundreds and thousands of shrines of Siva in every Dvipa, O excellent sages; on the mountains, in the forests, on the banks of rivers, lakes and on the junctions of waters.

Mandakini identical with Svarganga. For detail, see Gangavatara-varpana (Vayu, ch. 47; Matsya ch. 124). According to this description, scold and fresh water from the springs of the Kailasa mountain flows into a lake from which issues river Mandakini around which stands the picturesque Nandana forest of vast dimensions. S.M: Ali holds that the river Mandakini probably refers to the river Uma and the Zhong Chhu, which flow through Gauri Kunda (lying on the eastern flank of Mount Kailasa) in the Raksasa Tal (the twin lake of Manasarovar).

dvija here means 'ascetic brahmana:'

All the residents of the Kuruvarsa like the heaven-dwellers die simultaneously: They are delighted and flourishing: They take in all kinds of cooked rice and nectar:

# 23.

They shine always like the moon; they have perpetual youth; they are dark in colour in their bodies and always wear ornaments:

# 24.

Among all the sub-continents in the Jambudvipa the sub-continent of Kuruvarea is extremely splendid. There is a magnificent palace of the moon-crested lord Siva. It has the lustre of the moon.

# 25.

In the sub-continent Bharatavarsa men are auspicious and their longevity depends on their Karmans. They are said to live for hundred years: They are of different colours and their bodies are small:

# 26.

They are engaged in the worship of different Devas; they experience the fruits of different kinds of Karmans; they are richly endowed with knowledge and with different materials. They are weak and have very little pleasures.

# 27-28.

Some of them have gone to Indradvipa and some to Kaseruka. Others have gone to Tamradvipa and some to the country Gabhastimat. Some have gone to Nagadvipa, some to Saumyadvipa, and others to the Dvipa of Gandharvas as well as of Varuna: Some of them are Mlecchas and Pulindas born of different castes.

# 29.

In the Eastern parts of the Dvipa are the Kiratas; in the western extremities the Yavanas; in the middle the Brahmins, Ksatriyas and Vaisvas: The Sudras are everywhere.

317. The glorification of Bharats is one of the common topics in the Puranas. Bharata is one of the nine khandas of Jambudvipa; the other eight being Indradvipa, Kaseruka, Tamra-varqa, Gabhastimat; Saumye, Gandharve, and Varuna.

318. The Puranas are conscious of the foreign tribes that surrounded Bharata (cf. Matga. 50. 75-76; Mark. 57,8.). The Kiratas mentioned along the eastern limit are probably the uncivilized tribe of the forab and mountains with the Burmee type of features. The Yavanas in the west are Greeks originally and afterwards the Mohammedans.

30-31. They are established there maintaining themselves by worship; warfare and business dealings (respectively): Mutual dealings in connection with the activities of the different castes are related only to virtue, wealth and love: They are interested in their own duties. The conception and pride in performing the duties of the various stages of life are maintained properly.

32. It is only here that human beings endeavour for heavenly pleasures and salvation. O leading sages, only here they pursue the duties specified for each yuga, not elsewhere:

33. In the sub-continent Kimpurusa men live up to ten thousand years: Men are golden-complexioned and women resemble the celestial damsels.

34. They are devoid of ailments and sorrow. They are all purified by meditations on Siva: They have Sattva qualities along with the lustre of gold. They live on Plaksa fruits with their wives:

35-37a. The sub-continent Harivarca has men with complexion resembling gold. They are persons fallen from the world of Devas. They have divine forms and features in every respect: They worship lord Siva. They imbibe the auspicious sugarcane juice: Hence old age does not afflict them and they do not decay: They live up to ten thousand years:

37b-38. In the sub-continent Ilavrta that was mentioned by me as situated in the middle of the Dvipa, the gun does not blaze and men do not become old. There is no light in Ilavrta, neither the sun nor the moon nor the stars.

39. The people there have the lustre of lotuses. Their faces resemble the lotus. Their eyes are like the petals of the lotus: They have the fragrance of the petals of the lotus. They are purified by their meditation on Siva.

40. The juice of the Jambu fruits constitutes their diet: They are sweet-scented: They have no duties to perform. They have come there from the world of Devas and have neither death nor old age.

320. Since done by Karmas-Bhumi (hand) for performing actions.

C: vinu cited jo ST, 331.

41. In the divine sub-continent Ilavta, the excellent men live their full span of life which is thirteen thousand years.

42. By drinking the juice of the Jambu fruits they are not afflicted by old age: They have neither hunger nor fatigue: They do not die premature death:

43. The gold found there is called Jambunada. It is the divine metal. It shines and resembles glow-worm.

44. Thus the persons occupying the nine sub-continents have been recounted by me: Their colour, span of life, diet and other things have been succinctly mentioned and not in detail:

45-46. It should be known that the Gandharvas and celestial nymphs reside in Hemakuta. Sesa, Vasuki, Taksaka and all others live in Nisadha: The very strong Brahmanas called Yajiikas live on sacrifices. They number thirty-three thousands and they live happily on the mountain Nila, full of lapis lazuli, the Siddhas and Brahmarsis devoid of impurities.

47-51. The mountain Sveta is the homeland of the Daityas and Danavas. The mountain Srngavan (Srngi) is the abode of Pitrs. The Himavat is the abode of Yaksas, goblins and lord Siva. The lord is seen in all the mountains and forests. He is accompanied by Visnu, Brahma, Uma, Nandin and Ganas. In particular, lord Nilalohita is seen on the mountains Nila, Sveta, and Trisrnga perpetually together with the Siddhas, Devas and Pitrs.

The Nila is of the colour of lapis lazuli. The Sveta is white. The Hiranmaya has the colour of the feather of the peacock. The Trisrnga is golden in colour. All these lofty mountains are in the Jambudvipa.

# CHAPTER FITYTHREE

# Geography of the World

1. There are seven important mountains in each of the seven Dvipas beginning with Plaksa. They extend straight in all directions and form the boundaries of the great continents:

2-4. I shall mention the seven great mountains in the Plaksadvipa. The first mountain is Gomedaka; the second is Candra; the third is Narada; the fourth is Dundubhi; the fifth is Somaka; the sixth Sumanas, the same is called Vaibhava; the seventh is Vaibhraja. These are the seven important mountains in the Plaksa Dvipa.

5-9. There are only seven important mountains in the Salmalidvipa. I shall mention them in order. They are Kumuda, Uttama, Balahaka, Drona, Kanka, Mahisa and Kakudman.

In the Kusadvipa there are seven sub-continents and seven Kulaparvatas. I shall mention them by name, in brief: The first mountain is Vidruma, the second is Hemaparvata, the third is Dyutiman, the fourth is Puepita, the fifth is Kusesaya, the sixth Harigiri, the seventh is the glorious mountain Mandara: It is the abode of the great lord: The word Manda denotes the waters. Since the mountain holds the waters; it is called Mandara.

10. The bull-emblemed lord of the universe, the deity without impurities, stays there in person in an excellent golden palace accompanied by Uma and Nandin:

11-13a. Formerly the lord was propitiated in the great holy centre, Avimukta, by the mountain Mandara. He then obtained great boon. Mahadeva was requested by him for his stay there along with Uma. The lord left Avimukta and stayed on the Mandara along with his Ganas, Nandin and Uma. Therefore, he does not leave this mountain:

13b-16. The Kula Parvatas in the Kraunca Dvipa are seven. They are Krauica, Vamanaka, Ardhakaraka, Divavtt; Vivinda; Pundarika; and Dundubhisvana. These seven mountains in the Kraunca Dvipa are full of gems.

# Lingopurtna

# 17-19a.

There are seven mountains in the Sakadvipa. They are Udaya, Raivata, Syamaka, Rajata, Ambikeye, Ramya containing all medicinal herbs and Kcsari. It is from this Kcsari that wind is generated.

# 19b-24.

In the Pugkara Dvipa there is only one glorious mountain named Mahasaila. It has wonderful peaks full of jewels. The rocky ridges are lofty. In the eastern half of the Dvipa it rises very high with ridges of variegated colours: Above the ground level it is fifty thousand yojanas high. The great mountain goes deep below the ground level thirty-four thousand yojanas. This mountain stretches over half of the Dvipa with the Manasa range to the north of it. Situated near the sea shore it appears like the newly rising moon.

Above the ground level it rises fifty thousand yojanas high. Its total width and girth is also that much. The same is called Manasa in the western portion of the Dvipa. The same mountain of great ridges appears split into two due to its position. There are two meritorious and splendid Janapadas on either side of the Manasa mountain, shining like silver:

# 25-26.

The sub-continent Mahavita is on the exterior of the Manasa. The Janapada in the interior is called Dhatakikhanda.

# 27-28.

The Pugkara Dvipa is surrounded by the ocean of sweet water; All round this ocean extends to as much area as the Puskara Dvipa. In girth and extent it is equal to Pugkara. In the same manner all the seven Dvipas are surrounded by oceans severally and there are seven oceans in all:

# 29.

The seventh ocean is beyond all Dvipas: Thus the comparative sizes of dvipas and oceans are stated, enveloping the Puskara.

# 30.

The great ocean of sweet waters is stationed beyond that is the situation of the world. The earth is golden and twice in extent; The entire thing is comparable to a single rock of delimitation.

# 31.

Beyond it is the globular mountain.

# 32-34.

Mahavita and Dhatakikhanda. There are the two provinces of Pugkara-dvipa (identified with Japan, Manchuria and SE Siberia). The mountain Manasa runs in a circle like the moon and divides the two provinces. The exterior province is Mahavita and the interior is Dhataki.

Geography of the World
It is partially dim and partially bright: It is called Lokaloka.

33. O brahmins, this earth abides, as long as this visible-cum-invisible mountain exists. Its height is stated to be ten thousand yojanas.

34. The extent of the great mountain Lokaloka is also that much. The rays of the sun pass over its inner and nether half: In its other half there is perpetual darkness: Hence it is called Lokaloka Thus, the world Bhur is explained succinctly.

36-39. The Bhuvarloka is up to the sun: O excellent sages, the Svarloka is up to Dhruva (pole star). There are seven wheels of the wind, viz, Avaha, Pravaha, Anuvaha, Samvaha, Vivaha, Paravaha and Parivaha, O brahmins, these are the seven wheels of the wind.

O brahmins, the clouds, sun, moon, stars, planets, seven sages (Great Bear) are one above the other. The distance from the surface of the earth up to the pole star is fifteen hundred thousand yojanas.

40-43. The solar sphere is one hundred thousand yojanas above the surface of the earth. Above it the chariot of the sun is sixteen thousand yojanas. The Meru is eighty-four thousand yojanas above the surface of the earth: The Maharloka extends to a crore of yojanas above Dhruva. O brahmins, the Janaloka extends to two crores of yojanas beyond Maharloka: Tapoloka extends to four crores of yojanas beyond Janaloka: Beyond that the Brahmaloka extends to six crores of yojanas: O brahmins, the holy worlds in this Cosmic Egg are thus seven:

44. Beneath the seven nether worlds are the crores of hells: They are twenty-eight in number beginning with Ghora and ending with Meya cooked in them in accordance with their past activities.

45-46a. The sinners are cooked in them in accordance with their past activities. They say that in each of them there are five hells beginning with Raurava and ending with Avici.

46b-47. The Cosmic Egg has been mentioned by me at the outset: So also the sheaths of the Cosmic Egg: Incidentally the creation of Brahma too was mentioned in great detail. It should be noted that all the Puranas mention eleven divisions of the strato-sphere.



---


# Lingapurana

be known that there are thousands and crores of Eggs like these:

Since Pradhana is present everywhere within each of these Cosmic Eggs there are fourteen worlds in all sides as well as above and below.

The cause of their creation is lord Siva himself: The eight-bodied Siva is present in all the Eggs, in the exterior of the Eggs, in the coverings of the Eggs, in the extremities of the darkness and beyond darkness. Wonderful it is, everything in the universe is the body of the unembodied great Atman; of Mahesa, of the intelligent Mahadeva:

The mistress of the eight-bodied Siva is the divine Prakrti: Mahat etc. are his progeny; all the Pasus (Individual Souls) who identify themselves with their bodies are His servants.

The lord Siva is infinite: He is devoid of beginning and end: He is the Purusa: He is identical with the seven principles beginning from Pradhana. His body is Pradhana itself; having sixteen limbs (i.e: the organs of knowledge, organs of action, elements and mind). He himself is Mahesvara and Astatanu (eight-bodied).

It is due to the power of His command that the earth is held steady. So also the mountains, clouds, oceans; luminaries, Devas beginning with Indra, those who go about in the aerial chariots as well as the mobile and immobile beings:

Devas including Indra saw the lord devoid of specific characteristics in the guise of Yaksa. On seeing him they wondered "What is this?" They went to the Yaksa. Unable to come to any conclusion, fire and others exerted themselves but became weak and inefficient.

O brahmins, in front of that Yaksa the fire-god could not burn even a blade of grass; the wind-God could not shake a blade of grass; all the leading immortal beings failed to exercise their respective powers over him.

At that time, the enemy of Vrtra (i.e. Indra), the lord.

avtamurti, Siva is the householder whose mistress is Prakrti; whose are intellect; ego and five subtle elements. His eight-formed body has sixteen parts, viz. five gross elements, five organs of action, five organs of knowledge and the mind.

Yakea Siva in the form of Yakta is a semidivine being, cf. Brahma-Gita cited in ST.



---


of Devas, the cause of all prosperity, approached him along with the leading Devas. He said to the Yaksa, the lord of Devas, with great curiosity in his mind, 'Who are you, Sir ?"

58. At that time the Yaksa vanished. Then the splendid-faced daughter of Himavat, Uma, shining gloriously with many auspicious ornaments appeared in front of him.

59. Indra and others asked that unborn daughter of Himavat; Uma, the intensely bright one; "O Goddess, O excessively refulgent, what is this? O Uma, who was this shining one in the body of Yaksa?"

60. On hearing it, Uma said the Yaksa is invisible: Devas including Indra bowed down to that deity having the gait of a lion, and to Uma unborn and of red; white and black colour, being honoured by all the leading immortal beings.

61. On the deity, the cause of the activity of Devas and Asuras, said: Formerly I was Prakrti subservient to the behests of the Puruga the Yaksa.

62. Hence; O brahmins, the entire originated from the unborn at his behest and from the Egg originated Brahma. The entire world originated from him along with the luminaries. Thus the universe is identical with the Unborn (aja).

# CHAPTER FIFTYFOUR

# Movements of Luminaries

Sita said

1. In order to comprehend the movements of the planets after observing the holy centres of the lord I shall mention the movements of luminaries within the Cosmic Egg succinctly.

330. The system of stars, planets and constellations known as SinSumara-cakra, conceived rotating like the potter's wheel: In the vast space the stars arranged like the body of an alligator. They move around Dhruva (i.e the fixed centro). But it should be known that Dhruva is relatively fixed, for, in fact, it itself moves in the heavens. (Cf: Linga. 55. 10; Matsya 125.6) For detail, Matsya: Chs: 124-128.

2-3. In the east of the Mcru, the city of Mahendra is situated on the mountain Minasa; in the south the city of the son of the gun (i.e: Yama); in the west is the city of Varuna and in the north the city of Soma (Moon). In all these directions, the deities of the quarters are stationed. They are the cities of Amaravati, Samyamani, Sukha and Vibha in order.

4. Understand the movement of the sun when he has reached quarter over and above the guardians of the quarters in the course of his southern transit;

5. In his southern transit the sun rushes on like an arrow that is shot. Taking the multitude of luminaries with him he revolves perpetually.

6. O brahmins, when the lordly sun comes to the extremity of the city of Indra the sunrise is seen by all the people in Samyamani.

7. At the same time in Sukhavati the sun is seen as at the close of the night. But in Vibha, the lord, the eye of the universe, i.e. the Sun sets.

8. It has been mentioned by me that just as he absorbs waters in Amaravati so also he, the traverser of the firmament, after reaching Samyamani, Sukhavati and Vibha, absorbs waters. When there is afternoon in Agneyi (i.e: south-east),

9-11. O brahmins; it is forenoon in the south-west: When it is terrible latter half of the night in the north-west, it is the earlier part of the night in the north-east. Similarly, when the sucker of waters (i.e: the sun) moves about in the middle of Puskara, the mountain to the north of Manasa, he traverses a thirtieth part of the earth in Muhurta (48 mts). Understand this number in yojanas travelled in Muhurta.

12-17. The speed of the noble-souled sun per Muhurta is three million one hundred and fifty thousand yojanas. When the sun moves to the southern quarter with this speed from the north through the middle of Puskara during his northern transit and when he moves into the northern direction (from

20. Just as the middle of the pottcr'$ whecl moves more slowly (than the end part) $0 aleo in the Uttarayana (northern transit) the sun moves slowly.

21-25 . Hence he traverses a smaller area in thc course of a longer time: That chariot of the sun is occupied by Adityas, sages, Gandharvas, Apsarases, Gramanis, Serpents, and Rak- gasas. The thousand-rayed sun emits his rays in front, behind, below and above. Thereby he illuminatcs the excellent assembly of Brahma. During the sandhyas (dawn and dusk) the brahmins and sages offer water-libations. With thcse waters, the sun kills the demons as and whcn thcy comc ncar him and then goes ahead.

During the latter part of the uttarayana the day extends to eighteen muhurtas, during which the sun moves slowly. He covers the extent of thirteen and a half stars during the night consisting of twelve muhirtas and as many stars during the day consisting of eighteen muhurtas.

26. Just as the wheel whirls slowly at the nave, so also Dhruva whirls like the lump of clay in the middle:

27-28. Those who know the ancient lore, say that thirty muhurtas constitute a day and night during which the sun traverses the space in between the two limits (i.e: the solstitial points). Just as the nave of the wheel of the porter remains there alone (i.e. without moving) so also Auttanapada (i.e: Dhruva) rotates (without moving) as the leader of the luminaries along with the planets.

29-33. The group of the sages and the luminaries moves in accordance with his will (mind). Presided over by him the sun, along with the wind, takes up water from everywhere: The son of Uttanapada attained the state of Dhruva, thanks to the favour of Visnu. It was obtained by Auttanapada on account of his father. Gradually the waters drunk by the sun penetrate the moon being and from the moon they drip down to the clouds. Tossed about by the wind, the cluster of clouds causes shower on the earth: The word bhaskara (sun) is derived as follows: Bhasayet tena bhaskarah - (He who illuminates is bhaskara). There is no destruction of water. The same water revolves:

34-38. For the welfare of creatures, the waters have been evolved by lord Siva as their ultimate resort: The waters alone constitute Bhu, Bhuvah, Svah; anna (cooked rice) as well as nectar. The waters are the vital breaths of the worlds, the living beings, the worlds themselves. Of what avail is much talk? The world of mobile and immobile beings is constituted by the waters. Lord Siva is the overlord of the waters. He is glorified as such. The universe is identical with him. What is there to wonder at in this? The designation Narayana was acquired by Visnu by the grace of the waters. Visnu is the abode of worlds and the waters constitute his abode. When the mobile and immobile beings are being burned by the fire and tossed up.

as smoke by the wind, the vapours that go up purged by the wind form the clouds: of smoke, fire and

39-40. Hence the mixture wind is called cloud: The word abhra (cloud) is derived as follows: that which showers water. The lord of the clouds is the thousand-eyed Indra: The cloud originating from sacrificial smoke is conducive to the welfare of the twice-born. The cloud originating from the smoke of the forest fires, is conducive to the welfare of the forests.

41. O brahmins, the cloud originating from the smoke of the dead bodies brings about evil. The cloud originating from the smoke of the fire during magic rites brings about the destruction of living beings.

42. Thus there is weal or woe unto the worlds due to different kinds of smokes. Hence man shall stifle the smoke arising from the black magic rites.

43. If a brahmin were to perform black magic rites without covering up the smoke thereof; he will wantonly become the cause of destruction of the world.

44. O men of holy rites, the clouds that are receptacles of waters shower waters at the behest of the wind for six months for the welfare of the worlds.

45. The thunder pertains to the wind; the lightning arises from fire. O leading sages, the origin of snow from those clouds is in three ways:

46-48. The word abhra is derived thus: na bhrasvanti yatah (since they do not become destroyed). The word megha is derived as mehanat meghah - It is called megha because it makes waters. The clouds are of different kinds, viz, Kasthavahas, Vairincyas and Paksas.

When kasthas (sacrificial wigs) soaked in ghee come into contact with fire, smoke is generated (and this smoke forms the clouds). The origin of the second type of clouds is from the exhaled breath of Brahma. The origin of the third type of clouds is from the wings of mountains chopped off by Indra: The clouds arising from fires are auspicious and their place of resort is Avaha (a particular region of wind).

49-53a. All those clouds arising from the breath of Brahma

# 214

are in the layer of the wind Pravaha, while the clouds originating from Pakea (wings) Puekara and others shower water. They are respectively silent, noisy and destructive. The different clouds behave differently. Some rain in showers; some have cool winds blowing for a long time, some are enliveners; some are weak being devoid of lightning and thunder. Some stay here and there in the sky within 2 krosa (3 kms) from the surface of the earth: All the clouds clinging to the mountains are within half krosa: The clouds (called) meghas stay within yojana from the surface of the earth. They shower much water on the earth because it is possible for them to do so. They are equipped with lightning:

53b-56. Their way of making downpours of three types has thus been narrated to you. The clouds of the Pakgaja type originate from the clipped wings of the mountains. They are called kalpajas (born in the kalpes). Those autumnal clouds shower at night towards the close of the kalpa bringing about destruction.

When the Pakgaja, Pupkara and other clouds shower water; everything becomes a vast sea of water. During the night, the lord lies down there:

0 leading brahmins, the smoke of the clouds arising from fire, from the exhaled breath and from the clipped wings, is refreshingly enlivening:

57. The showers of the clouds Paundras; (i.e., those falling in the land of Pundra) are accompanied by lightning, are cool and hence conducive to plant growth. They are ice-cool and look like the spray of water from elephant trunks.

58. The clouds called Ganges originate from the waters of Ganga. Through the wind in the Paravaha region these agitate the mountains, rivers and elephants of the quarters.

59. The water separated from the clouds goes from one mountain to another: The wind Paravaha takes the cloud to the Himavat mountain.

60. O brahmins, the remaining shower after crossing the Purkartadyth Puqbre, Avarts, etc: comprise a class of clouds that burst in torrents at the dissolution of the world: of wicked ited-

The sun' $ chariot

Himavat approaches the sub-continent Bharata in order to make the other side flourish:

1. The showers have been recounted now. They are of two types being conducive to the increase of two types of vegetation. I shall mention them briefly according to my knowledge:
2. The sun of great splendour, the lord with the eye of the universe is the creator of rains. O excellent brahmins, he is the great Isana, Siva himself:
3. He alone is the splendour, power and strength; O brahmins. He is fame himself: He is the eye, ear, mind, Mrtyu, soul, Manyu; the quarters and the interstices, truth, order, discipline, wind, firmament, planets, the guardians of the quarters, Vignu; Brahma, Rudra and Mahesvara himself:
4. This glorious thousand-rayed deity lord Siva is very auspicious. He has eight hands, a body semi-female and three eyes. He is the overlord of Devas. O brahmins, it is due to his favour alone that rain of various kinds occurs. The sun takes up water by his rays in order to give it back thousandfold: There is neither increase nor decrease of water, if we consider it duly. The wind presided over by Dhruva withdraws the rain. It falls off the planet sun and spreads through the sphere of the stars. At the close of the movement, it re-enters the sun and is presided over by Dhruva.

# CHAPTER FIFTYFIVE

# The sun' $ chariot

I shall briefly describe the chariot of the sun, moon and other planets as also how the sun traverses drinking up the waters.

# Lingapurana

The chariot of the sun has been created by Brahma for specific purpose of leading brahmins, it is conceived through the parts of the ycar.

The golden chariot of the sun is the abode of all Devas. It has a single wheel with five spokes and three naves.

Its length and breadth is nine thousand yojanas. Twice that length is the distance between the driver's box and the pole shaft.

The horses are stationed on the side where the wheel is. They are unattached but appear to be yoked. There are seven horses. They are evolved out of the vedic passages and 330 metres.

The horses are bound to the side of the wheel. The axle is fitted to the pole shaft: The chariot revolves along with the wheel and the horses, and the pole shaft revolves along with the axle.

The axle prompted (Pole with the single wheel: It is the intelligent Dhruva star) that urges the luminaries by means of the wind and the rays (or by the wind which acts as reins).

There are two reins in the chariot: They are united to the extremities of the yoke and the axle: The chariot tied by means of the reins to the yoke and the axle revolves by the grace of Dhruva.

As the chariot whirls and moves along the firmament there shall be circles of bright lustre: The extremities of the yoke and the axle are to the right of the chariot.

When the horses beyond the wheel are pulled by Dhruva by means of reins, both of them (the yoke and axle) as also the reins follow the pole shaft that whirls.

The extremity of the yoke and the axle of this chariot which has the steed of wind whirls in all directions like a rope fixed to a nail. In the course of Uttarayana as the chariot moves about in the mandalas the reins increase in size.

The horses of the star car are the seven metres, vir-, 8 yetrl, uipik, anuvtup; brhatl, padkti, trittup and jegatI.

Vicakralve when the horses, wheel and Aruna the driver are secured by Dhruva.

are let loose). In the course of the Dakginayana, when the chariot moves about in the mandalas the reins are pulled inwards. In either case; the reins are operated by Dhruva and then the sun seated within, moves about in the mandalas:

14-15. The distance between the two solstices consists of one hundred and eighty degrees. The sun moves about the mandalas externally as the reins are being released by Dhruva: He then encircles the mandalas and moves quickly.

It has white rays in the form of sparkling water particles. The moon increases in force in the bright half and is stationed in the way of the sun. Day by day it gets refilled till the end of that half: The sun develops and nourishes it: It is drunk up by Devas during the dark half. It is being drunk in continuity for fifteen days by Devas. The sun refills it part by part by his single ray Sugumna. Thus the physical body of the moon is developed and nourished by the vigour of the sun.

# 4-6.

On the full moon day it appears with its full white disc. Beginning with the second and ending with the fourteenth day in the dark half; Devas drink up the moon that was nourished and developed day by day during the bright half. They drink the watery honey and nectar that had been accumulated in the course of half a month; thanks to the splendour of the sun. They sit near the moon for a single night on the full moon day for drinking up the nectar from the moon, along with the sages and Pitrs.

# 10b-13.

The digits of the moon facing the sun get diminished daily, being drunk up from the beginning to the end of the dark half: Thirty-six thousand three hundred and thirty-three Devas drink the moon. After the moon has been drunk for half a month, day by day by them, those excellent Devas go away on the new moon day: On the new moon day the Pitrs occupy the Moon.

# 14-18

When the fifteenth part remains as the last digit, the groups of Pitrs occupy this in the afternoon. For the duration of two kalas (units of time) they drink up the remaining digit—the nectar of svadha that has oozed out of the rays on the Amavasya day: After drinking the nectar they attain full satiety for the whole month and then go away: By the time the remaining digit of the moon drunk by the Pitrs gets dissolved, the fifteenth part is replenished. The increase and the decrease of the moon in the beginning of each fortnight is on the sixteenth day: The increase in the moon is thus due to the sun.

# Movements of the Planets

Sita said

1-5. The chariot of the son of the Moon (i.e: Budha = Mercury) is fitted with eight horses, tawny-coloured and very splendid. It has the characteristics of water and fire.

The chariot of Sukra (Venus), the preceptor of Daityas, is fitted with ten stout horses of different colours. It is earthen in nature.

The chariot of Bhauma (Mars) is golden, splendid and fitted with eight horses.

The horse of Jiva (Jupiter) is also golden and fitted with eight horses. The chariot of Mandaeu (Saturn) is made of iron; it is fitted with ten black horses and is watery in nature.

The chariots of Rahu and Ketu are fitted with eight horses each. All these planets are bound to Dhruva (Pole Star) by reins which are of the form of wind. Made to whirl by the Pole Star, they move ahead.

6. There are as many rays as there are stars. While revolving (round it), they make it revolve also.

7. The stars and the luminaries, urged by the circular gusts of wind, move like firebrands. Since the wind bears the luminaries, it is called Pravaha.

8. Along with the planets and constellations, the sun and stars occupy the firmament in a circle looking upwards and sideways.

9. Presided over (i.e: controlled) by Dhruva, they circumambulate Dhruva. They move on in the firmament to see Lord Dhruva that acts like the pivot.

344. Chapter 56-57 describe the movement of the planets - Soma, Budhe, Mangele, Brhaspati, Sukre, Sani and Rahu.

345. Jata-cekre-vat. The imagery of the wheel implies a fixed center (madhibhutan dhruven divi, ch. 57.9) to which the whole system of moving stars is secured by certain pulls, spoken of as wind (vittantmibhih, ibid, V. 5; Matsya 125.7).

10. The diameter of the sun is nine thousand Yojanas. Its circular area is three times this.

11. The extent of the moon is twice that of the Sun: Rahu assumes a size equal to them and moves ahead beneath them:

12. The abode of Rahu is full of darkness and is the third (one in size) because it is evolved out of the circular shadow of the earth:

13. The diameter, the circumference and the distance in yojanas of Bhargava (Venus) is a sixteenth part of that of the moon. Brhaspati (Jupiter) is of three-fourths of the size of Venus:

14-18. Mars and Saturn are three-fourths of the size of Brhaspati. Budha (Mercury) is three-fourths of their size in extent and circumference: The stars and constellations, that have a body are equal to Budha in extent and circumference: The knower of truth must note that the stars that are in conjunction with the moon are ordinarily known as Rksas. The spheres of the comparatively smaller stars extend to five yojanas. Over all these four, three or two there are still clusters of smaller stars which extend only to two hundred yojanas: There is none smaller than this.

19-20. Over and above these starry spheres are the three planets viz, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, which travel at a great distance from them: They should be known as slow-moving ones. There are four other great planets beneath them, viz. the Sun, Moon, Mercury and Venus. They traverse quickly:

21. Altogether there are as many crores of stars as there are constellations. They too are stationed in the orbit of constellations due to the restraining force of Dhruva:

22-26. The sun that has seven horses has an upper and lower position by turns. When the sun is in his northern transit and when the moon on the full moon nights, appears quickly because its position is above, but the rays are not very clear; the moon then is in the southern orbit that is lower. The sun covered by the line of the earth on Full moon and New Moon days is seen at the usual time, but it sets quickly. Hence on the New-Moon day the moon is in the northern orbit: It is invariably not seen in the southern path on account of

the movement of the planets and because it is enveloped by the shadow of the sun. On the equinotical days the sun and the moon rise and set simultaneously.

27-28. In the northern orbits they rise and set without any difference in time on new moon and full moon days. They should then be known as following the groups of luminaries. When the sun is in the southern transit; it moves ahead beneath all other planets.

29. Keeping his sphere wider the moon revolves above it (the sun). All the groups of constellations move above the moon:

30. Mercury is above all constellations; Venus is above Mercury. Mars is above Venus and Jupiter is above Mars:

31. Saturn is above it. Above Saturn is the sphere of seven sages (Great Bear) and Dhruva (Polc Star) is stationed above the seven sages.

32-39. By knowing the region of Visnu, beyond all these, one is liberated from sin. Two hundred thousand Yojanas above constellations, stars, the planets--Sun and Moon which are united with divine refulgence, move ahead day and night in due order. They come into contact with the constellations everyday: Hence they are sometimes stationed below, sometimes above and sometimes in a straight line: They glance at the subjects (below) simultaneously when in conjunction or when separated: but of five distinct features. There are Six seasons overlap one another and their combination should be understood by learned men without overlapping: O brahmins, thus the movement of planets has been succinctly mentioned in the case of the sun and other planets as I have heard and observed.

The thousand-rayed lord Sun was crowned as the overlord of planets by the lotus-born Brahma, like Guha who was crowned by Rudra of purpose and ward off evils at the time of harassment of the planets and the sun, the worship of the planets should be pursued by good men. Offerings should be made to fire in accordance with the injunctions of the Sastras.

The sages said

# 1

Suta, most excellent among the speakers, kindly tell us in detail the exact nature of the luminaries briefly:

# 2

On hearing their words, Sita of great concentration and purity spoke these weighty words in order to clear their doubts.

# 3

In this matter I shall tell you what has already been stated by highly intelligent persons with tranquil wisdom: I shall recount the movement of the sun and the moon.

# 4

I shall tell you how the sun, the moon and other planets are the abodes of Devas. Thereafter, I shall mention the three types of fires and their origin.

# 5-9

The three types of fire are the divine fire, the elemental fire and the terrestrial fire:

When the night of Brahma born of the unmanifest reached the stage of dawn, this visible universe was one that had not been analyzed: It was still enveloped in the nocturnal darkness: When the worlds were still in the state of destruction, when a fourth of the period still remained, the self-born lord, he who achieves all the affairs of the worlds, moved about like a glow-worm, with a desire to manifest: At the beginning of the world, he created Agni (heat) in combination with earth and water. The Lord gathered these together to make it shine and then divided it into three:

# 10-11

The fire in the world of mankind is called Parthiva: The fire that blazes in the sun is called Suci: The fire born of lightning is known as Abja (i.e. originating from the water portion). I shall now mention their characteristics: There are three types of fires with water within; viz, Vaidyuta, Jathara (gastric) and Saura (Solar).

# 12-13

Hence; imbibing water through his rays the sun blazes (further). The Abja (waterborn-lightning) fire even when immersed in water is not quenched by it. The fire that is

mahaprajñaih by the most intelligent men, i.e. by Vyate and others.

# 35+

Threefold fire: (i) celestial, represented by the sun, (ii) atmospheric, symbolized by the lightning, (iii) terrestrial, which is used for the sacrificial and household purpose. Fire is called Pivake on earth, Suci in heaven and Vaidyuta in the firmament.

Form %f solar roys
within the stomach of men is not put out by water: The gastric fire emits flames (i.e: heat), but is devoid of lustre.*

# 14-19.

When the sun is setting, the solar lustre becomes a circular mass without heat and enters the fire at night through his rays. Hence the light of fire is seen even from a distance at night: The heat is transmitted to the sun from fire; when the sun rises only partially does the terrestrial fire enter the sun. Hence the fire continues to blaze: Thus the fire element in both terrestrial and solar fires contains heat and light: They penetrate mutually and develop each other. In the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth, the fire and the sun thus develop each other. The sun rises up from the waters and re-enters them. Therefore; due to this exit (from and into waters) by day and by night, the waters become copper-coloured. Again when the sun sets, the day (i.e. daylight) enters the waters. Hence at night, the waters are seen shining white:

# 20.

By means of this activity he enters waters perpetually, during day and night at the time of rising and setting both in the southern and northern hemispheres.

# 21.

The sun who blazes, imbibing the waters through his rays has the mixture of earthly and fiery particles within it: It is called divine fire:

# 22-23.

This fire (i.e: sun) has a thousand feet (i.e. rays). It is like a circular pot: It takes up waters from various water-resorts through the thousand tubular rays: It takes waters from the rivers, seas, wells, clouds etc. It takes up both mobile and immobile waters i.e. those of the canals and tanks.

# 24-25.

He has a thousand rays emitting snow, rain and heat: Of them four hundred tubular rays have forms of variegated colours. They shower rain. Their collective name is Amrta and the several individual names are Bhajanas, Malyas, Ketanas and Patanas.

# 26-27a.

The tubular rays carrying and emitting snow are three hundred in number. The several names of these rays emitting snow are Resas, Meghas, Vatsyas and Hladinis: Their collective name is Candrabha and they are yellow in lustre.

Fire on earth is the symbol of heat and fire in heaven is the symbol of light and both are interdependent. Cf, Matsya. 128.13. Mlrlea

27b-28a. Suklahb, Kakubhah and Visvabhrt are the individual names of the rays emitting heat; their collective name is also Sukla beings, Pitrs and Devas.

28b-29. The moon sustains human beings through them (the above rays). He propitiates human beings through the medicinal herbs; the Pitrs with Svadha and Devas through nectar:

30-314. During spring and summer the sun blazes by his three hundred rays: During the rainy season and Autumn he showers rains through the four hundred tubular rays. During the early and the late winter he discharges snow through his three hundred rays. Indra, Dhatf, Bhaga:

31b-35a. The twelve suns are Mitra, Varuna, Aryaman, Amsu, Vivasvan, Tvagtf, Parjanya and Vienu: the Phalguna. Varuna is the sun in Magha; Pusan in the month of Caitra, Ansu is the sun. Dhat is the sun in Vaisakha. In Jyestha Indra is the sun. In Asidha, the sun is Aryaman: Vivasvan is the sun in Sravana. In Bhadra the sun is Bhaga. Parjanya is the sun in Asvina. Tvastr is the sun in Karttika. In Margasirea Mitra is the sun and Visnu is the sun in Pausa: While performing the duty of the sun, Varuna has five thousand rays; Pugan six thousand rays; Arsu seven thousand rays; Dhatr eight thousand rays; Indra nine thousand rays; Vivasvan ten thousand rays; Bhaga eleven thousand rays; Mitra seven thousand rays; Tva;tr eight thousand rays; Aryaman ten thousand rays; Parjanya nine thousand rays; Vignu scorches the earth with six thousand rays:

39-40. In the spring the sun is tawny coloured; in the summer he has the lustre of gold. During the rainy season the colour of the sun is white. In the autumn the sun is grey-coloured. In the early winter the sun is copper-coloured and in the late winter he is red in colour:

356. The numerous star rays have their functional division. For instance; four hundred of them function for creating rain (Vxt-26), three hundred for heat (V.e8) and three hundred for cold (V.a6). These rays are distributed over the and bring about the change of cold; heat and rain:

232 Lingapurana

There is no doubt that the three worlds have their source in the sun, including Devas, Asuras and human beings. The entire universe originates from him: He is the lustre of all luminaries and the universal refulgence. The refulgence of Rudra, Indra, Upendra, the moon, the leading brahmins, the fire and the heaven-dwellers comes from the sun. He is the soul of all. He is the lord of all worlds. He alone is Mahadeva, Praja-Pati and the lord of the three worlds. He is the original great deity: Everything originates from him and dissolves in him.

9. The existence and non-existence of the worlds originated from the sun formerly: O brahmins, this refulgent sun of great lustre is an incomprehensible planet.

10-11. All these units of time begin from him and end in him again and again, viz, ksanas (moments), muhurtas (a unit of 48 mins.), days, nights, fortnights, months, years, seasons and yugas. Hence without the sun there is no reckoning of time.

12-15. Without Kala (time) there is no order, no initiation, no daily ritual. How can there be the division of the seasons? Whence are these flowers, roots and fruits? Whence is the outcome of plants? How can there be the different kinds of grass and medicinal plants? The dealings of the creatures in heaven and here too will be non-existent without the sun who is the form of Rudra, the scorcher of the universe: He alone is time, fire, Dvadasatman (one having twelve forms) and Praja-pati: O excellent brahmins, he scorches the three worlds including the mobile and immobile beings: He is the mine of splendour. He is all in all, the whole set of worlds.

The ray Sannaddha is the source of origin of Mars: The ray Sarvavasu is the source of origin of Brhaspati (Jupiter). The ray Svarat nourishes Sanaiscara (Saturn) _ Thus it is due to the power of the sun that the constellations, planets and stars are seen in the heaven. This entire universe is sustained by him:

The constellations are called Naksatres. The word is derived from Vksi with the prohibitive particle 'na' i.e. na keiyante (i.e: those which do not perish).

3. The sun is called Aditya because he takes up the divine and terrestrial splendours as well as the nocturnal darkness:

359. The principal seven rays, Sugumna etc, of the thousand-rayed sun are the source of energy and movement of stars, planets and constellations. For instance; the solar ray, called Sugumna, causes the movement of the moon.

4. The root *tsu'* is used in two meanings to extract juice or to flow: Since the sun extracts refulgence and makes water flow, it is called Savitr.

5. The root *cadi* from which the word Candra is derived means 'to delight'. It implies whiteness, chillness, and nectarine nature of the moon (Candra):

6. The divine discs of the sun and the moon are refulgent; They move in the sky: They are white and are of the nature of fire and water: They are splendid and they resemble a circular disc of

7. The moon is of the nature of dense water. The disc of the sun is white and is of the nature of dense fire:

8. Devas reside in constellations, sun and planets. They live everywhere in these abodes in all the manvantaras.

9. Hence the planets are abodes named after their respective planets: The Sun entered the abode Saura. The Moon entered the abode Saumya: Saukra: Jupiter, the valorous,

10. Venus entered the abode. The Mars with sixteen rays entered the abode Brhad (big). The Mars entered the abode Lohita pertaining to Mars.

11. The Saturn entered the abode Sanaiscara. The Mercury entered the abode Baudha. The evil planet Rahu entered the abode Svarbhanu (named after him).

12. The deities of constellations entered all these abodes: These luminaries are the abodes of meritorious souls.

13. These abodes have been created by the selfborn deity: They began to function at the beginning of kalpa and they stay until all the living beings are dissolved.

14. In all the manvantaras they alone are the abodes of Devas: These deities who have identified themselves with the abodes occupy these divine abodes again and again:

15-20. They occupy these abodes along with Devas of the past, present and future. In this current manvantara the planets are moving about in aerial chariots: In the Vaivasvata manvantara the sun is Vivasvan the son of Aditi; the lustrous lord Moon the son of sage Atri; lord Sukre, Bhargava, is known as the priest of Asuras. The preceptor of Devas; the shining one of massive splendour, is the son of Angiras (Brhaspati) Budha (Mercury) is

the charming son of a sage. Saturn is the ugly son of Vivasvan born of Samjia. Agni was born of Vikesis as the youthful son of Lohitarchis. The constellations named Naksatra and Rksa are Daksayanis (daughters of Daksa). Rahu is the son of Simhika. He is an Asura causing distress to living beings.

21. Thus the constellations and planets in the sun and the moon as also their abodes and the various deities occupying them have all been mentioned:

22. The fiery abode Saura belongs to the thousand-rayed Vivavina: The abode of the snow-rayed moon is watery and white.

23. The abode of Budha (mercury) is watery, dark-coloured and charming: The region of Sukra (Venus) is also watery but white with sixteen rays.

24. The abode of Bhauma (Mars) is reddish and it has nine rays. The abode of Brhaspati (Jupiter) is yellow with sixteen rays and is very large:

25. The abode of Sani (Saturn) is black with eight rays. The abode of Svarbhanu (Rahu) is gloomy and is a place of great distress to living beings:

26. All the stars should be known as the abodes of sages with one ray each: They are the resorts of men of meritorious renown and are white in colour:

27. They are of the nature of dense water (snow). They were created in the beginning of the kalpa. Thanks to the contact with the rays of the sun they have a shining appearance.

28. The diameter of the sun is nine thousand yojanas. The extent of its circular surface is three times that:

29. The extent of the moon is twice that of the sun. Rahu assumes a form equal to both of them and moves about beneath them.

30. The third massive abode of Rahu is dark and dreary: it is created in the form of a circle out of the shadow of the earth.

31. Vikesi. The graha Bhauma (Mangale) born of Vikesi is here called agni (fire). agnirmurdha (RV. 8.44.16) wherein Bhauma is called agni. Vikesi is one of the eight wives of the eight-formed ("lamurti") Rudre, others being Svavarcalt, Um, Sive, and Rohini.

32b-33. The diameter, circumference and distance in terms of yojanas of Venus is sixteenth part of that of the moon. Jupiter is three-fourths of the size of Venus:

34. Mars and Saturn are fourth less than Jupiter: In extent and width Mercury is a fourth less than these two:

35. The forms of those constellations and stars that are embodied are equal to Mercury in width and circular area.

36-39. The constellations that are in conjunction with the moon are ordinarily known as Rksas. The spheres of the comparatively smaller stars are five, four, three or two Yojanas. Over all these there are clusters of still smaller stars which extend to only half a yojana in width: There is none smaller than this: Over and above these starry spheres are the three planets which move at a great distance from them: They should be known as slow moving ones: The speed of these has already been mentioned in due order.

40-45. All the planets are born of constellations. Sages, the sun, the son of Aditi, the first among the planets, is born of the constellation Visakha. The lustrous son of Dharma, lord Vasu, Soma (moon) - the cool-rayed lord of the night; is born of the constellation Krttika. The sixteen-rayed son of Bhrgu, Sukra (Venus) who is the most excellent among the stars and planets after the sun, is born of the constellation Tisya. The planet Brhaspati (Jupiter) the twelve-rayed son of Angiras, the preceptor of the universe, is born of the constellation Purvaphalguni: Prajapati, the nine-rayed.

The planet (Mars) son of red bodied planet is born of the constellation Purvasadha. The son of sun, the seven-rayed Saturn, was born of the constellation Revati:

46-47. The five-rayed planet Budha (Mercury) the son of the moon is born of the constellation Dhanistha. Sikhi (Ketu) the great planet that destroys all, who is dark in nature; who is the son of Mrtyu the god of Death and who is.

the cause of destruction of the subjects, is born of the constellation Aslesa. Dakga's daughters were born of the constellations which have their own names:

- Dark-sphered Rahu who is full of Tamasaic vigour, is the planet that suppresses the moon and the gun. He is born of the constellation Bharani.
- It should be noted that the planets beginning with Bhargava (Venus) are known as star-planets (i.e., planets resembling stars). Persons who are affected by afflictions from their birthday stars are liberated from that defect by devotion to their respective planets. Among all the planets the first one, it is said, is Aditya (Sun):
- Among all the star-planets Sukra is the first. Among all the Ketus (flaglike Meteors) the smoky one is the first (It is usually called Dhimaketu). Dhruva is the first among the planets distributed in all the four quarters. Among constellations the first is Sravisthaw. Among the Ayanas (transits) the Uttarayana (northern transit) is the first. Among the five years the first is Sarvatsara. Among the seasons it is the late winter (Sisira). Among the months it is Magha. Among the fortnights it is the bright half and among Tithis it is Pratipat (first day). Among the division of days and nights, the day is the first. The first of the muhurtas is that the deity of which is Rudra:

Ksana has the nimesa as its first unit of time, excellent ones among the knowers of time. Beginning with the constellation Dhanistha and ending with Sravana shall be yuga comprising of five years. The universe whirls like a wheel due to the movement of the sun. Hence the gun is the lord and deity delimiting time: He is the instigator and castigator of the living beings. Rudra, the lord himself, is the inducer four types of =

A group of five years constitutes Yuga which should not be confused with the cycle of four Yuges: This five-yearly cycle forming yuga corresponds to the Vedic doctrine of panca-devata or five deities who have entered the Puruta: Cr; TB [.4.10.I. The five years with their presiding deities are:

This is a wonderful phenomenon that is caused by the unique Pradhana and is incomprehensible: The movement of the luminarics cannot be understood by thc nian with his physical eye: It can be understood by the learned man only through Vedic treatises, by inference and direct perception, by cogent arrangements and cereful analysis in his mind.

4-5. He had two wives, Suniti and Suruci: highly intelligent son of great renown, named Dhruva was born of Suniti the elder wife: He had great understanding and was the light of the family: When he was seven years old, once he sat in the lap of his father.

6. O leading brahmins, Suruci who was proud of her beauty pushed him away: Delighted in her mind she placed her own son on the lap of his father:

7. The intelligent boy Dhruva became dejected in his mind because he was unable to occupy the lap of his father: He went to his mother and lamented.

8. Overwhelmed by her grief, the mother said to her weeping son: "Suruci is the most beloved of her husband: Her son too is likewise:

9. You, O son born of me, a very unfortunate woman, are also equally unfortunate: Why do you bewail? What for do you weep again and again?

10. If you are distressed in heart you will increase my sorrow. My dear son, you shall by your own power attain more comfortable and stable abode:

11-12. On being advised thus by his mother he set out towards the forest; On meeting Visvamitra, he bowed to him duly and spoke with his palms joined in reverence:

0 holy sir, foremost among the pious sage, it behoves you to tell me how I shall obtain a place above everyone:

13. O sage, I was seated on the lap of my father: My step-mother Suruci pushed me aside: My father, the king, did not protest:

the destroyer of distress: He is born of the right limb of Siva the intelligent great lord

19. 0 highly intelligent one, repeat the Mantra of the lord continuously. It is great; pure and holy, it destroys all sins and yields all desires.

20. Repeat this divine Mantra controlling your sense, with the Pranava "Namostu Vasudevaya" [Obeisance be to Vasudeva]: Meditate on the eternal Vignu: Be interested in japa and homa.

21-24. On being advised thus, the boy of great renown bowed to Visvamitra and began his japa facing the east. He restrained himself and was delighted in his mind. Alertfully he repeated the mantra continuously without break for a year, sustaining himself on vegetables, roots and fruits. Terrible vampires and demons, large fierce beasts like lions rushed at him in order to confound his wits. But, repeating the name Vasudeva he did not take notice of anything else:

25. A female ghost assuming the form of his mother Suniti came near him and wept bitterly and miserably.

26-27. "So you are my only son. Why do you torture yourself? Leaving me helpless, you have taken to penance."

The boy continued his great penance and did not even glance at the lady who spoke thus. With delight in his heart he repeated the name Hari.

28-29. Then all the forms of impediment and harassment subsided from all sides: Seated on Garuda, lord Visnu who resembled the black cloud in lustre, who is the destroyer of enemies, who was surrounded by Devas and who was being culogised by great sages, came there before Dhruva.

30-31. On seeing the lord come near; he simply thought within his mind "who is this?" Drinking as it were Hrsikesa the lord of the Universe, by his eyes the boy of great lustre, seated himself and repeated "Vasudeva". With the tip of his conch the lord touched his face:

32. Thereupon he attained the highest knowledge: With his palms joined in reverence he culogised the lord the most excellent of all divine beings:

367. Vignu is born of the right side of Siva, while Brahma is born of the left.

Origin of Devas and others

33. Be favourable; lord of the chiefs of Devas; O wielder of conch, discus and iron club; O soul of the worlds; O soul of all, O soul of all secrets of the Vedas, O Kesava, I have sought refuge in you:

34. Even the great sages Sanaka and others have not comprehended you, the great Atman: Then how can I know you? O lord of the worlds, obeisance to you:

35. Then Vishnu said to him smiling, "O dear one, come on. You are Dhruva (steady). Attaining fixed and steady abode be the first among all luminaries."

36. You along with your mother shall attain the abode of luminaries: This abode is mine, the greatest, the steady splendid abode: acquired by lord Siva formerly.

37-38. It was me from after propitiating him by penance: The devotee who repeats continuously the name Vasudeva along with the Pranava Om, the word 'Bhagavat' and the word 'namas' denoting obeisance attains the fixed abode of Dhruva:

39-42. Then all Devas, Siddhas, sages and Gandharvas installed Dhruva in that abode along with his mother: Thus, at the behest of Vishnu he attained the abode of luminaries: By means of the twelve-syllabled mantra, Dhruva of great splendour attained the highest perfection.

Sita said: Hence, the man who makes obeisance to Vasudeva attains the world of Dhruva and achieves steadiness.

# 2.

The creation of ancient people was by means of mental conception, direct perception or touch. Subsequent to Daksa the son of Pracetas, creation is by means of sexual intercourse:

# 3-6.

When he began to create the group of Devas, sages and serpents, the world did not increase: Thereupon, by means of sexual intercourse, Daksa begot of Suti, five thousand sons.

On seeing those blessed ones who were desirous of creating different kinds of progeny, Narada spoke to Haryasvas, the sons of Daksa who had assembled together:

(Understand the extent of the earth from above and below, O excellent sages, and then proceed ahead with your special creation.

On hearing his words they went away in all directions.

# 7-10.

Even today - they have not returned like the rivers after joining the ocean: When Haryasvas vanished, lord Daksa Prajapati begot of Suti herself another thousand sons: O brahmins, they were named Sabalas and they assembled together for the purpose of creation.

Narada spoke to those persons of solar splendour, who had assembled before him: "You should proceed with your special creation after understanding the full extent of the earth; or on return after finding out what has happened to your brothers."

They too followed their brothers and attained the same goal as their brothers before:

When they too vanished the Prajapati Daksa the son of Pracetas, begot sixty daughters of Virini:

# 12-15.

He gave ten of them in marriage to Dharma, thirteen to Kasyapa, twenty-seven to the moon, four to Aristanemi, two to the son of Bhrgu; two to the intelligent Krsasva and two to Angiras. Now listen to the names of the mothers of Devas and the details of their progeny from the very beginning: Vasu,

The Bhanus were born of Bhanu; the Muhurtakas were born of Muhurta; the Ghogas were born of Lamba. Nagavithi was born of Yami. Sarkalpa was born of Sankalpa. I shall tell you the creation of the Vasus. Devas who are luminous and who pervade all the quarters are called Vasus: 370 They are the well wishers of all living beings: They are reputed to be eight, viz: Apa, Dhruva, Soma, Dhara, Anila, Anala, Pratyusa and Prabhasa.

20b-22a. The eleven Rudras; 871 the leaders of the Ganas are: Ajaikapad, Ahirbudhnya, Viripaksa, Bhairava, Hara, Bahurupa, Tryambaka the lord of Devas, Savitra, Jayanta, Pinakin and Aparajita.

22b-26. I shall mention the sons Syapa from his thirteen wives: Aditi; Diti, Arista, Surasa, Muni, Surabhi; Vinata, Tamra, Krodhavasa, Ila, Kadru, Tvisa and Danu:

I shall tell you the names of the sons of these: Devas who were known as Tugitas in the Cakgusa manvantara are spoken of as the twelve Adityas in the Vaivasvata manvantara. The following twelve are the thousand-rayed Adityas: Bhaga, Indra, Dhatf, Tvast, Mitra, Varuna, Aryaman, Vivasvan, Savitf, Pusan, Ansumat and Visnu: Kasyapa.

27. We have heard that Diti had two sons from viz. Hiranyakasipu and Hiranyaksa. They

28. Danu bore a hundred sons to Kasyapa. They were mighty and arrogant: O excellent brahmins, among them Vipracitti was the chief:

370. Vesus are a class of deities, eight in number. They seem to have been personifications of natural phenomena. They are Ap: (water), Dhruva (Pole star), Soma (moon), Dhara (earth), Anila (wind), Anala (fire), Prabhate (dawn) and Pratyuta (eight).

371. In regard to the name of the eleven Rudras the Puranas are not unanimous.

Suki duly gave birth to parrots and owls. Syeni gave birth to hawks (falcons), etc. Bhasi gave birth to deers. Grdhri bore the vultures, doves, pigeons and other birds. Suci gave birth to swans, cranes and other aquatic birds.

# 32-34.

Sugrivi gave birth to goats, horses, sheep, camels and donkeys. Vinata gave birth to Garuda and Aruna, two sons, and then daughter Saudamini (lightning) terrible unto all the worlds.

A thousand cobras were born to Surasa. Kadru gave birth to thousand thousand-hooded serpents: Twenty-six excellent ones among them are well known as their chiefs.

They are XSesa, Vasuki, Karkota, Sankha, Airavata, Kambala, Dhananjaya, Mahanila, Padma, Asvatara, Taksaka, Elapatra, Mahapadma, Dhrtarastra, Balahaka, Sankhapala, Mahasankha, Puspadamstra, Subhanana, Sankhaloman, Nahuga, Vamana, Phanita, Kapila, Durmukha and Patanjali.

# 38-41.

Krodhavasa gave birth to the Raksasas wielding great power of deception and also the group of Rudras. The excellent lady Surabhi gave birth to cows and buffaloes as the children of Kasyapa. Muni gave birth to the group of sages and Apsaras: Arista gave birth to Kinnaras and Gandharvas. Ila gave birth to grasses, trees, creepers and hedges. Tvisa gave birth to crores and crores of Yakgas and Rakgasas. Kasyapa narrated these are the immediate descendants of succinctly. These had their own numerous sons, grandsons, etc.

# 42-45.

Their races are many: After the children had been procreated by the noble Kasyapa, after all the mobile and immobile beings had been well established, Prajapati crowned the chief ones among each of them as overlords. He made Vaivasvata Manu the overlord of human beings. Those who were crowned by Brahma in the Svayambhuva manvantara, even.

47-49 In the past manvantaras these had been Others are being crowned when new manvantara arrives. All the kings of the past and future manvantaras are mentioned in detail:

After procreating these sons for the continuity of the race Kasyapa performed penance once again with the desire to have a son who will preserve the spiritual line:

50-51. Even as Kasyapa was meditating thus, two sons of great prowess manifested themselves by the grace of Brahman: Those two Vatsara and Asita were expounders of Brahman: Naidhruva and Raibhya Were born of Vatsara:

52-54. The sons of Raibhya are known as Raibhyas. I shall mention those of Naidhruva. Sumedhas was born of the daughter of Cyavana. She became the wife of Naidhruva and the mother of Kundapayins. The glorious son Devala was born of Ekaparna and Asita. He was a knower of Brahman; the best of all the Sandilyas and one possessing great penance: Thus the descendants of Kasyapa became three branches; Sandilyas, Naidhruvas and Raibhyas. Devas had nine sources of origin. I shall mention

55-58. the line of Pulastya. I have practically passed by After eleven cycles of four yugas when Manu was the lord and half the period of Dvapara had passed by, Dama was born as the son of Narigyanta, a descendant of Manu: Dama's descendant known as Trnabindu became king in the third quarter of Tretayuga. His daughter Ilavila was unrivalled in beauty and the king gave her in marriage to Pulastya:

59. Visravas the great sage was born of Ilavila. His four wives are the progenitors of the family of Pulastya:

60-65. The first wife Devavarnini was the splendid daughter of Brhaspati, The second and third wives were the two

Lingapurane daughters of Malyavan; viz. Puspotkata and Balaka and the fourth wife Kaikasi was the daughter of Malin:

Now listen to the children of these ladies: Devavarnini bore the eldest son Vaisravana to him. Kaikasi gave birth to Ravana, the king of Raksasas, Kumbhakarna, Surpanakha and Viblusana. 0 excellent brahmins, Puspotkata bore him Mahodara, Prahasta, Mahaparsva, Khara and the daughter Kumbhinasi. Now listen to the children of Bali [i: e Balaka]: They were Trisiras, Dusana, Vidyujjihva and the daughter Malika. Thus the Raksasas of ruthless activities belonging to the family of Pulastya are nine:

# 66-68.

Vibhisana is glorified as the knower of Dharma. He was a highly pure soul: animals, tigers, goblins, ghosts, the deer, the fanged serpents, boars, elephants, monkeys, Kinnaras and Kimpurusas were the sons of Pulastya.

In the Vaivasvata manvantara Kratu is said to be issueless. Atri had ten beautiful and chaste wives: Ghrtaci

# 69-70.

Bhadrasva begot of the celestial damsel Ananda ten children viz Bhadra, Abhadra, Jalada, Manda (or Nanda), Bala, Abala, Gopabala, Tamarasa and Varakrida progenitors of the family of Atreya.

# 71-73.

These are the progenitors of the family of Atreya. Their husband is Prabhakara. When the sun was swallowed by Rahu and he fell down towards the earth from the heavens the whole world was enveloped in darkness. At that time Atri spread lustre everywhere: He said 'Hail to Thee" and then the falling sun ceased to fall at the instance of the brahmin sage: Then Atri was called Prabhakara by the great sages.

# 74.

He begot of Bhadra the renowned son Soma (Moon). The sage procreated more sons of those wives:

# 75.

They are well known 28 Svastyatreyas. They were sages and masters of the Vedas. Two of them became well renowned. They had realised Brahman: They were very powerful;

# 76.

Datta was the eldest son of Atri: Durvasas was his younger brother: The youngest sister was Amala, an expounder of the Brahman:

# 77.

Four of them born of two Gotras are well known in the world, viz Syava, Pratvasa, Vavalgu and Gahvara.

Origin %f Devas and Others
78. Four lines of the spiritual family of Atreyas of noble souls are known as Kasyapa, Narada, Parvata and Anuddhata.

79. These were born as mental sons. Now understand the children of Arundhati. It was Narada who gave Arundhati to Vasistha: Due to a curse of Daksa, Narada of great splendour became a bachelor by compulsion.

80-82. Formerly, when a terrible war between Devas and Asuras, on account of the demon Taraka, took place, the world was oppressed due to drought: Along with the guardians of the quarters, the intelligent sage Vasistha sustained the subjects by means of his penance: He made water, cooked rice, roots, fruits and medicinal herbs and out of mercy he enlivened the people with medicines.

83. Vasistha begot hundred sons of Arundhati: Adrsyanti bore to Sakti, the eldest of those hundred, the son Parasara.

84-88. Sakti was swallowed by the demon Rudhira (along with his brothers). Kali bore to Parasara the son Krsna Dvaipayana. Suka and the Dvaipayana begot of Arani the son Upamanyu of Pivari: Know that the following are the sons of Suka viz. Bhurisravasa, Prabhu, Sambhu, Krena and Gaura: There was a daughter Kirtimati: She was a yogic mother, performing holy rites. She was the wife of Anuha and mother of Brahmadatta. The following are the descendants of Parasara viz. Sveta, Krena, Gaura, Syama, Dhumra, Aruna, Nila and Badarika: Thus there are eight lines of these noble-souled Parasaras.

89-91. Henceforth understand the descendants of Indrapramiti: Vasistha begot of Ghrtaci the son Kapiajalya. He who is known as Trimutri is called Indrapramiti. Bhadra was born of Prthu's daughter. His son was Vasu whose son was Upamanyu. There are many descendants of Upamanyu, Mitra and Varuna: Those who are known as Kaundinyas are the descendants of Mitra and Varuna.

878. Kaundinyes and Vaciethas have common ancestry in Mitra and Varuna. Hence the matrimonial alliance does not take place between them.

92-95. There are others of single sage-head, who are well known as Vasisthas: There are ten lines of the noble descendants of Vasistha. Thus these mental sons of Brahma are known on the earth: These blessed ones are the supporters of the spiritual legacy: Their descendants are well known. They are competent to support even the three worlds. They are born of the families of divine sages: Their sons and grandsons are hundreds and thousands. The three worlds are pervaded by them in the same manner as by the rays of the sun.

The sages said:

1. O Suta, O best speaker, it behoves you to recount how Sakti the son of Vasistha was devoured by a demon along with his younger brothers:

Sita said:

2-3. The demon Rudhira devoured Sakti the son of Vasistha along with his younger brothers due to a curse by Sakti on king Kalmasapada: O leading brahmins, urged by Visvamitra, Rudhira haunted the king Kalmasapada for whom 374: There are different versions of this legend in the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Vigpupurana. According to Mahabharata, Kalmasapada, king of the star race, was the son of Sudas and a descendant of Ikshvaku. While hunting in the forest he met Sakti, the eldest son of Vasistha. Since he was out, Sakti refused to get out of his way, Kalmasapada was enraged. He then struck Sakti with the whip. Thereupon, Sakti cursed him to become a raksasa. Thus, Kalmasapada was turned into raksasa Rudhira by panic and he devoured Sakti together with his brothers. But according to Linga, the raksasa King Rudhira catered the body of Kalmasapada when the latter was engaged in sacrifice, under the leadership of Vasistha. Instigated by Visvamitra, who was a rival priest, Rudhira devoured Sakti as well as his ninety-nine brothers: the legend of Visvamitra. According to Valmiki, Linga refers to Rambayana; Sakti was cursed by Visvamitra in the context of Ling Trisanku's sacrifice:

On bearing that the most powerful Sakti had been devoured by that demon along with his brothers, Vasistha repeatedly lamented (my) $Op, hi (my)sn. The wailing sage fell down on the ground along with Arundhati:

6-10. Remembering his hundred sons, the eldest of whom was Sakti, and knowing that the family was extinct, the powerful sage decided to die: Coming to this conclusion that he will not remain alive without his sons, he felt all the more miserable: Vasistha the son of Brahma, the knower of everything, the self-possessed sage who had realized the Atman, climbed to the top of a mountain along with his wife: With tears welling up in the eyes he suddenly fell down on the ground: As he fell down on the ground, the earth (assuming the form of a lady) who had a wonderful necklace and the sportive gait of an elephant, caught him up with her lotus-like hands and as he cried she too bewailed with him. At that time, his daughter-in-law, the wife of Sakti, cried in great fright and spoke thus to Vasistha, the great sage and the best among the eloquent sages.

11. (0 lord, 0 excellent brahmin, 0 powerful sage, preserve this excellent body of yours to see your grandson, that is my son. Leading brahmin, this splendid body should not be discarded by you, since the child that is born of Sakti and that is bound to be one who realizes all objects, is within my womb:

12. 0

13-14. After saying thus, that lady who was conversant with Dharma and whose eyes resembled lotus flowers lifted up her father-in-law by her hands and wiped his eyes with water. Although she was herself miserable she requested the dejected Arundhati to save her father-in-law.

15-16. On hearing the words of his daughter-in-law Vasistha got up from the ground after regaining consciousness: Arundhati embraced him in great distress and fell down. The leading sage touched Arundhati, in whose eyes tears had welled up and cried along with her.

17-18. Thereafter the son seated in the couch of the womb of his mother, like the four-faced lord Brahma in the umbilical lotus of Viepurepeated a sacred verse: The holy sage Vasistha listened enthusiastically to the sacred verse wondering, by whom could it have been repeated. He then meditated with great concentration.

19. Thereupon Viepure whose eyes resemble the lotus petals, who had been stationed in the courtyard of the firmament; who is the soul of the universe and who is the storehouse of mercy spoke to Vasistha mercifully:

20. O dear one; O dear one; O Vasistha the leading brahmin, fond of his son, this sacred verse has emanated from the lotus-like face of your grandson.

21. O sage, this grandson of yours, the powerful one born of Sakti is on a par with me. Hence, O most excellent sage and son of Brahma, discard your grief and rise up.

22. The child in the womb is a devotee of Rudra: He is engaged in the worship of Rudra. Thanks to the power of Rudra he will redeem your family:

23. After saying thus to Vasistha, the leading Brahmin sage, the merciful lord vanished there itself:

24. Vasistha of great splendour bowed his head to the lotus-eyed lord and then stroked the belly of Adrsyanti with great respect: O brahmins, he cried out, "ha my son, ha my son."

25-27. Extremely depressed, glancing at Arundhati who was also crying and remembering his own son he cried out in misery, "O son, come again, come again. O Sakti, after the birth of your son who will sustain this family: I shall undoubtedly come near you along with your mother," Seta said.

After saying this, the crying brahmin embraced Arundhati: Beating her belly she was about to fall.

28-32. The auspicious lady Adrsyanti who was distressed beat her belly—the abode of the child in womb. She cried out in distress and fell down. Arundhati and Vasistha, both of them were extremely frightened: They lifted up the young woman their daughter-in-law and said thus:

0 ailly woman, tell us how you have attempted to destroy the family of Vasistha by striking at the region of womb. For seeing your son, the child born to Sakti and for tasting the nectar of the boyish face of the noble son, the leading sage has decided to preserve his body: Hence protect your body.

Seta said:

# 33-34.

After pulling up her daughter-in-law and the sage, Arundhati the wife of Vasistha stood up and said though highly distressed and agitated:

0 lady of good body rites, since the life of this sage, and that of mine depend on you, you should preserve your life: As nurse do what is beneficial to us.

# AdrSyantf said:

# 35.

If the excellent sage has decided to preserve his life I shall somehow preserve my body pure or impure:

# 36-37.

It is because of my sin that I have to bear the sorrow of separation from my husband. 0 sage, I am burnt with grief; even though I am your daughter-in-law, 0 sage: Alas, a miracle has been seen by me: 0 lord, I am the victim of grief: 0 brahmin, be my saviour from misery, 0 son of Brahma, 0 preceptor of the universe:

# 38.

Still, woman without husband shall be miserable: noble lord (sage), save me from that situation.

# 39.

The father, mother, sons, grandsons, even the father-in-law, all are helpless to such woman. None of them can be a real kinsman unto women: It is the husband alone who is her real kinsman, her greatest salvation:

# 40.

What has been mentioned by the learned men viz. the wife is half of the husband, has turned out to be not true in my case: Sakti has gone: But I still survive:

# 41.

0 leading sage, alas! the hardness of my mind! even after leaving my husband who is like my own vital breath, I could live for even a moment:

# 42.

0 Vasistha, just as a creeper climbing on the holy fig tree, survives even after being cut off from its roots, I too survive.

even after I have become miserable on being abandoned by my husband.

43. On hearing these words of his daughter-in-law, the intelligent Vasietha who observed the duties of his stage of life decided to go to his hermitage along with his wife:

44. The meritorious-souled holy lord Vasistha though suffering badly, entered his hermitage quickly, accompanied by his wife and Adrsyanti; and began to ponder:

45. O leading sages, that chaste wife of Sakti preserved the child in the womb with great difficulty for the continuity of the family line:

46. In the tenth month the wife of Sakti gave birth to a lustrous son in the same manner as Arundhati had previously given birth to Sakti:

47. Sakti's wife gave birth to Parasara like Aditi who gave birth to Vispu; like Svaha who gave birth to Guha and like Arani who gave birth to Agni.

48. When the son of Sakti incarnated on the earth; Sakti, abandoned his sorrow and attained equality with the Pitrs.

49. O leading sages, that meritorious son of Vasistha; stationed in the world of the Pitrs along with his brothers shone like the sun along with the Adityas.

50. O leading brahmins, when Parasara incarnated, the departed father sang, the grand-fathers and great-grand-fathers danced.

51. The Pitrs who previously expounded the Brahman on the earth and the deities in heaven danced: Puskara and others moved about in the firmament showering flowers.

52. O brahmins, in the cities of the Rakgasas there were odd and painful shouts. The sages in their hermitage applauded continuously with delightful experiences.

53. Just as the four-faced lord incarnated from the Cosmic Egg, just as the sun emerges from the clusters of clouds, so also Parasara was born of Adrsyanti:

54. On seeing the son and remembering her husband, O brahmins, even Adrsyanti felt both joy and grief. So was the case with Arundhati and sage Vasistha.

55. On seeing her son, the highly refulgent Parasara, the agitated lady lamented with her throat choked:

56. Even as her sinless son adored by the groups of Devas and Danavas, was born, the mother realized that he was highly intelligent. With tears in her eyes she lamented:

57. 'Ha, son of Vasistha, you have gone somewhere after abandoning me whose wretchedness is visible in the face: You have left me in the middle of the forest as one desirous of seeing her son. O lord; you too, see your bosom-born, sinless son.

58. O Sakti, with his delight evident in his face Mahesvara saw his six-faced son along with his Ganas. Similarly, you too see your son in the company of your brothers.'

59. Hearing her lamentation, the excellent sage Vasistha became miserable and said to his daughter-in-law, "Do not cry, O daughter of Vasistha, that noble lady."

60. At the behest of Vasistha, that noble lady eschewed her sorrow. That lady with roving eyes like the fawn nursed and nurtured her son.

61. On seeing his chaste mother as a weak lady, devoid of ornaments, sitting down dejectedly, with tears agitating the eyes, the boy said to her:

62. "So mother, sinless one, your slender body does not appear to be splendid without ornaments. It is like the night bereft of the disc of the moon."

63. "O my mother, O my mother, O splendid lady, it behoves you to recount to me why you are sitting here setting aside your auspicious marks as a woman without her husband."

64. On hearing the words of her son, Adrsyanti did not tell her son anything, good or bad:

65. The son of Sakti said to Adrsyanti again, "O mother, where is my holy father of great refulgence? Tell me; tell me."

66. On hearing the words of her son, she became extremely agitated and wept; saying "your father was devoured by a Raksasa," she fell down unconscious:

On hearing directly from his mother, "Your father was devoured by a demon," the intelligent Parasara spoke thus with his eyes dimmed and darkened by tears:

# ParaSara said

# 69.

O mother; I think I will be able to show my father in a moment by worshipping the lord of the chiefs of Devas and of the three worlds including the mobile and immobile beings.

# 70.

On hearing these splendid words she was surprised. Smilingly she looked at him and said, "So son, this is true. Worship the lord."

# 71.

On understanding the proposal and decision of the son of Sakti, Vasistha the holy lord, the intelligent leading sage, and the storehouse of mercy, spoke to his grandson as follows:

# 72-74.

O excellent sage of good holy rites; your proposal is proper and suitable: Still, listen, it does not behove you to destroy the world: You can worship the lord for exterminating Raksasas. But, O son of Sakti; what is the harm done to you by the world that you need to destroy it?

Thereafter at the behest of Vasistha the extremely intelligent son of Sakti directed his mind towards the extermination of Rakgasas:

# 75-78.

Parasara bowed down to Adrsyanti, Vasistha and Arundhati: In the presence of the sage he made a single Linga, in trice; out of dust: Repeating the following Mantras from the Vedas he worshipped it. The mantras were Sivasukta, Tryambakasukta, Tvaritarudra, Siva Sankalpa, Nilarudra, Rudra, Vamiya, Pavamana, Pafca Brahman; Hotrsukta, Linga: sikta and Atharvasiras. After worshipping duly he offered the eightfold Arghya to Rudra.

Thereafter the delighted Mahadeva, the suppressor of the Cupid and of Andhaka, blessed the son of Sakti and vanished there itself:

109. The Raksasas are not guilty. It had been so ordained in your father's case - Anger provokes only the fools and not the intelligent people:

110-11. O dear son, who is killed by whom? Man is but the partaker of fruits of his own activities: dear son, fury is but the destroyer of fame and penance which men accumulate after great deal of stress and strain. Enough of these Rajasaic activities of burning innocent people:

19b-21. Ila, his eldest daughter and the most excellent one, had formerly attained the state of a man. O leading sages, it was due to the grace of Mitra and Varuna that she attained the state of man when she was known as Sudyumna.

In fact; the text recorded less than one thousand names, unless we include 'matah (repeated thrice, cf: verse 61, 75, 87) etc: proper nama: It may also be observed that the names are identical in form: Nilah (105, 116), Anibditah (121, 124), GuhavasI (131, 138), Viqpu (126, 162), Jett (55, 81), Dhata (126, 141), Balah (99, 122), Munih (91, 91), Lambitostheh (109, 123), Mehakanthah (108, 142), Vrkyeh (85, 192); Others are repetitive in sense; Smalanavtsi (57), Smalansvan (108); Nareh (59), Nare, Vigrahah (105); Mahtroma (10), Mahakctah (10); Candrah (61), Induh (150); Other than the name of god Vasudevah (92), Adbokanjah (101), Vitau (126, 162) (of Vivpu); Dhata (126) (of Brahma); Devcndra (155), Sakra (126), Amarcte (122), VajrI (154) (of Indra); Vamadeva (92), Kepila (119) (of sage).

ST. explains these anomalies in the following way: (1) Identical forms are interpretable differently. (2) Siva is omni-formed and hence can be identical with (3) Originally, there were ten thousand names whose authorship was assigned to Brahma. They were reduced to one thousand and eight numbers by Brahma himself and handed down to Tandin for propagation among the worshippers:

# CHAPTER SIXTY

# The narrative of Yayali

Sita said:

1-2. By the grace of the lord of Devas as well as of Tandin, Tridhanvan attained assiduously the benefit of thousand horse-sacrifices: Thereafter he gained the lordship of Siva's attendants. He was bowed to by all Devas. The scholarly king Trayyaruna was the successor to Tridhanvan.

3-4. He had an extremely powerful son named Satyavrata. He killed the king of Vidarbha of unmeasured prowess and abducted his wife before the mantras of the wedding celebrations were brought to close. The king Trayyaruna abandoned him because he was defiled by that evil.

5. When abandoned, he said to his father, "Where shall I go?" The father replied to him, "Go and live among the Candalas."

6-14. On being ordered thus, he went out of the city. At the instance of his father, the intelligent Satyavrata went to the Candala colony: On being abandoned by his father thus he stayed near the slum while his father went to the forest. The valiant son and meritorious king Satyavrata became famous in all the worlds under the name Trisanku: Once Vasistha pronounced on him a curse. Visvamitra of great splendour granted him boons and crowned him king in the hereditary kingdom. The sage performed a sacrifice on his behalf: Even as Devas and Vasistha were watching, the holy lord Visvamitra raised him up to heaven in his human form. His wife, Satyavrata born of the Kekaya family gave birth to a spotless son Hariscandra. Hariscandra's son Rohita was very powerful.

12. Harita was the son of Rohita. Dhundhu was the son of Harita. Vijaya and Sutejas were the sons of Dhundhu:

5582. Vidarbha—i.e. the kingdom of Vidarbha, mod. Berar; now placed under the administration of Maharlytra province.

559. Amitaujes—according to ST, it is the name of a king.

561. Kekeye—Kekeyus lived between the Jhelum and the Beas and had their capital at Girivreje (Girijek modern Jelalpur) on the Jhelum river.

13. Vijaya was so called because he conquered the kings of the Keatriyavarna. His son Rucaka was a righteous king:

14. Vrka was the son of Rucaka. From him was born Bahu: Sagara; an extremely virtuous king was his son.

15. Sagara had two wives, Prabha and Bhanumati: The very sage Aurvate was propitiated by both of them; with desire for sons:

16-17. The delighted Aurva asked them to choose a boon of their liking out of the two, viz. one would have sixty thousand sons and the other a single son, who would continue the family line. Prabha chose to have many sons and Bhanumati one son who was Asamanjasa.

18. Thereafter Prabha gave birth to sixty thousand sons. While digging the earth; they were burned by the angry outbursts of Vignuses in the guise of Kapila as if through arrows.

19-20. Asamanjasa's son is well known as Ansuman. His son was Dilipa. From Dilipa was born Bhagiratha who performed Penance and brought the Ganges to the earth. So it is called Bhagirathi. Bhagiratha's son was Sruta.

21. Nabhaga was his successor: He was a valorous devotee of Siva. His son was Ambarisa, from whom was born Sindhudvipa. The earth, ruled over by Nabhaga Ambarisa with the power of his arms became entirely devoid of the three-fold distress.

22. The valorous son of Sindhudvipa was Ayutayus:

23. Rtuparna of great fame was the son of Ayutayus.

24-25. This powerful king was a friend of Nala: He was conversant with the secret of dice. In the Puranas, two Nalas of stable holy rites are well known. One was the son of Virasena and the Other born in the family of Ikvgaku. Sarvabhauma, the lord of the subjects was the son of Rtuparna.

26. King Sudas was his son. He was equal to Indra. King Saudasa was the son of Sudas.

People of all castes including the leading brahmins spoke to the king who was desirous of crowning his youngest son: "O lord, how does the youngest son deserve the kingdom after overlooking the claims of the eldest son Yadu, the son of Devayani and the grandson of Sukra? We are addressing you to keep up the traditional Dharma.

# CHAPTER SIXTYSEVEN

Yayati said: The Narrative of Yoyati

1. Let the members of all castes beginning with the brahmins listen to my words in regard to this why I have decided that the kingdom should in no way be given to the eldest son Yadu. My behest was not carried out by Yadu my eldest son.
2. The son who is mentally opposed to his father is not approved of by good men.
3. The son who acts according to the instructions of his parents is praised by good men. He is the real son who behaves towards his parents in a manner befitting a son.
4. I have been treated with disrespect by Yadu, Turvasu, Druhyu and Anu.
5. My instructions were particularly honoured and carried out by Puru: He is my youngest son by whom my old age had been taken over: Sukra had ordained that I would be attacked by old age.
6. When he was requested, my old age was made transferable by him, given by Sukra himself: "The boon was the kingdom." May son who favours you shall be your heir to all, O sires, approve of it: Puru shall then be crowned king.

ThSagessaid: "The son who is endowed with good qualities and who is always beneficent to his parents deserves all welfare; although he may be the younger son. Lord Puru deserves this kingdom since he is the son who has carried out your instructions. Because of the boon granted by Sukra this cannot be made otherwise.

Szta said: The son of Nahusa was told thus by the delighted people of the land.

1. After crowning his son Puru in his own kingdom he directed Turvasu his son to be the southern border chief:
2. Similarly the king employed the eldest son Yadu in the southern frontier and Druhyu and Anu in the west and in the north respectively.
3. After conquering the earth including the seven islands and seven oceans; the son of Nahuca divided the kingdom into three parts among his sons.
4. With the royal glory transferred to his sons and with the burden placed on his kins, the king became pleased: His mind was filled with delight. Following song formerly sung by the great king Yayati:

A man shall be glorious if only he withdraws all his desires like the tortoise withdrawing all its limbs; otherwise not, even if he performs a crore of holy rites. Lust is never quelled by the enjoyment of desires. Just as the fire becomes all the more blazing with oil poured into it, so also it is heightened by the same.

Whatever grain or barley the earth contains; the entire gold it has, and all the animals and women of the earth are not enough for the insatiable desire of even a single individual: Considering this fact, man should remain tranquil (i.e: free from desires) and has no sinful motives towards any living being.

When man mentally, verbally or physically he attains Brahman.

Narrative %f Yoyali 295

When man is not afraid of others, when others are not afraid of him, when he neither despises nor hates, he attains Brahman. Happiness is attained by one who eschews covetousness which is difficult to avoid by wicked men, which does not age even if he ages and which is an ailment that ends only with his life:

When one ages, his hairs, his teeth, his eyes, his ears all do age. But greed alone remains free from old age.

Everything in respect of person does age of its own accord, not otherwise: But the yearning for life and the craving for riches do not age even if the person ages.

The happiness arising from the fulfilment of desires in the world, and the great divine happiness of heaven do not merit ever sixteenth part of that happiness which one has when thirst for objects is dispelled.

After saying this that saintly king entered the forest accompanied by his wives.

25-28. He performed penance on the peak Bhrigutunga. There the renowned king practised fast and attained heaven along with his wives. His line of successors consisted of five holy kings who were honoured even by divine sages. The entire earth is pervaded by these descendants like the rays of the sun. By reading or listening to the holy narrative of Yayati a man becomes intelligent, rich, long lived, famous and blessed with issues. Liberated from all sins he shall be honoured in the world of Siva.

After bowing to the sage, Krishna obtained the divine Pasupata Yoga: At his behest he shaved off the beard, moustache and the hair on the head, applied ghee all over the body and wore the girdle of the Munja grass. Thus initiated, lord Krishna the scorcher of foes performed great penance:

76. He performed the penance in various poses: He stood with arms raised up and without support, he stood on the tips of his toes. He spent three seasons sustaining himself on fruits, water and air.

77. Satisfied with his penance, lord Siva granted him boons. He gave Samba the son of Jambavati to Krishna the noble soul.

78. On getting the son Samba from Krishna, his wife Jambavati became highly delighted in the same way as Aditi when she obtained Aditya:

79. O leading sages, by the curses of Lord Siva the thousand hands of Bina were cut off by Krishna.

80. Then with Balarama to assist him he carried out the destruction of Daityas: He sportively killed several wicked kings in the battlefield.

81. He killed the leading Daitya Naraka born of Devas:

of Bapa. For slightly different version, see HM: p.t2.

# Srikrsad, his birth and life

thanks to a boongranted by the noble brahmin Ordhvacakra:

The excessively strong one, Krsna took up sixteen thousand one hundred girls for his own pleasure:

Under the pretext of a curse from the brahmins he destroyed the family of Vrsnis: After that he, the lord, remained in Prabhasa.

More than hundred years elapsed thus even as Krsna ruled over Dvaraka removing the distress due to old age: He acceded to the curses of Visvamitra, Kanvase and Narada, as also the words of Durvasas (and stayed) in Pindaraka.

Krsna abandoned the human form under the pretext of the arrow of the hunter Jaraka, and after blessing that hunter he returned to heaven of Astavakra as also due to his own Maya (power) the wives of lord Krsna were abducted by thieves. Balarama abandoned his human form and assuming that of Sesa went to his heavenly abode: The auspicious queens of Krsna Rukmini and others entered fire along with the body of their lord: O brahmins, the gentle lady Revati too entered the pyre along with her husband Balarama and followed his path: The extremely powerful Arjuna performed the obsequies of Krsna, Rama and also of other Vrsnis.

# CHAPTER SEVENTY

# Various Creations

The sages said:

1. O Suta, the primordial creation had been indicated by you but not clarified: O person of good holy rites, it behoves you to recount it in detail now.

Suta said: leading sages, the great lord Siva is stationed beyond Prakrti and Purusa. He is the greatest soul.

2. The unmanifest originated from that lord as the greatest cause: Thinkers on metaphysical reality call it Pradhana or Prakrti.

3. It is devoid of smell, colour and taste: It has neither sound nor touch: It is unageing, stable, imperishable and perpetually stationed in the soul:

4. It is the source of origin of the universe. It is the eternal great Brahman, the massive being: It is the physical body of all living beings. It is induced by the command of the lord.

5. At the outset the Pradhana existed in the form of Brahman. It had neither beginning nor end. It was unborn and subtle consisting of the three Gunas. It was the source of

origin of the universe as well as eternal. It was neither manifest nor comprehensible.

1. When the Gunas were in equilibrium, when it had not been differentiated, when it was identical with darkness; all this visible universe had been pervaded by its existence due to Siva's will: of creation, as the Pradhana was presided over by the individual soul - Purusa, the principle Mahat manifested revealing itself as subsidiary to Prakrti:
2. At the time it was enveloped by the subtle and great Avyakta (unmanifest). At the outset, when the principle of Mahat had the predominance of Sattva, then only it revealed existence.
3. The Mahat should be known as the Cosmic Mind. It is said to be the sole cause of creation. It originated as presided over by the individual soul and only as beneficent symbol:
4. Its forms Dharma etc., are the causes of the principles and objects of the world. Induced by the desire to create the Mahat carries on the activity of creation:
5. It is named variously as Manas (mind), Mahat (great), Mati (intellect), Brahman; Pib (city), Buddhi (intellect), Khyati (faculty of discriminatory knowledge), Isvara (lord), Prajia (perfect knowledge), Citi (consciousness), Smrti (memory), Samvid (cognition), and Visvesa (lord of the universe).
6. It is called Manas because it ponders over the fruit of the activity of all living beings [from the root man to think]. Subtle as it is, the fruits of its activities appear to be divided i.e. many and different:
7. It is called Mahat because it originated at the outset prior to all other principles as well as due to its magnitude: It is greater than Visesasse1 and Gunas.
8. It possesses magnitude [Manam Bibharti]. It ponders and causes differentiation: It is also greatly related to the enjoyment (i.e. experience) of Purusa. Hence, it is known as Mari.
9. It is defined as Brahman because of its brhatva (massiveness) and brmhanatva (state of becoming swollen).

19. Since enjoyment of is based on the knowledge thereof, and also since each item of enjoyment is dependent on knowledge, it is known by the word khyati.

20. The principle of Mahat is called by the term 'Khyati" also because objects in many instances are named (khyayante) through its qualities such as knowledge; etc.

21. It is a great soul and it directly perceives everything: Hence, it is called Isvara. Since it follows up knowledge it is called Prajna.

22. Since it collects such forms as Jiana (knowledge) etc, and the fruits of many holy rites, for the sake of enjoyment, it is called citi from the root ci).

23. Since it remembers all affairs of the present; past and future it is called Smrti (from the root smp).

24. It is called Sanvid because it obtains the entire knowledge and knows the greatness of everything [from the roots vid to know and vind to obtain]:

25. O excellent sages, (for another reason also) it is called Samvid by great men. It exists [from root vid to exist] everywhere and within it one obtains everything [vindati]:

26. From the root Jna (to know) they call it Jnanam: For the lord is the fountainhead of all knowledge. Since it repudiates bondage etc, [the Mahat] is called Isvara by learned men.

27. This first excellent tattva Mahat has been thus explained by many synonymous words by those who are conversant with the nature of tattvas and who always think about the existence of the lord.

28. The Mahat carries out the work of creation when it is induced by the desire to create: Samkalpa (volition) and Adhyavasaya (effort) are its two traits.

30. From the same ahamkara with tamas over the other two came about the creation of Bhutatanmatras (the essence of sound, etc). It is called Bhutadi (cause of the elements) and it is tamasa in nature:

31. The Bhutadi on disintegration created Sabdatanmatra (the essence of sound). From this was born Akasa (ether) (also called) Sugira (hole) = that is marked by sound

32-34. Akasa characterised by sound enveloped Sparsatanmatra which on disintegration created Vayu characterised by touch. Vayu on disintegration created Rupatanmatra: Therefore; it is said that Jyotis originated out of vayu, with colour as its quality. Jyotis on disintegration created Rasatanmatra. Apah (waters) originated from it with taste as their main quality.

35. Waters on disintegration enveloped Rasatanmatras. created Gandhatanmatra.

36. From it the sanghata (solid earth) originated: Its special attribute is smell when each of the elements remains within its specific quality (sound, etc) it is called tanmatra and this exclusive nature is called tanmatrata.

37. The Tanmatras are also called Avisesas, because in that stage they do not define anything in particular (as distinct from others): They are Avisesas for another reason also they are Prasantas (quiescent) or Ghoras (terrible) or Mudhas (confused).

The organs of speech (the tenth Indriya) are the organs of function or activity. Their activities are respectively gait (movement), evacuation, pleasure, arts, crafts and speech:

# 43.

Both ether and the element of sound penetrated the element of touch: Hence wind has both the attributes - sound and touch.

# 44.

Similarly both sound and touch entered colour. Hence, the fire has three attributes, viz, sound, touch and colour.

# 45.

The attributes of sound, touch, and colour penetrated the element of taste. Hence; waters have four attributes including taste as their special attribute.

# 46.

Sound, touch, colour and taste penetrated smell: Combined with the element of smell they pervaded the earth.

# 47.

Hence, the earth contains all the five attributes and is considered the grossest of all elements. They are quiescent, terrible or confused: Hence, they are called Visesas.

is the quality of earth alone: It is because the particles of earth have got mixed with water and wind that the smell appears to be present in them.

These seven massive beings beginning with intellect (Mahat) and ending with Visesas (gross elements) create the cosmic egg because they depend upon one another, because they are presided over by Purusa and because they are blessed by the unmanifest:

53. Like the bubbles in the water the cosmic egg is born at once from the Visesas. The whole egg is embedded in water.

54. The cosmic egg is encircled by waters ten times in extent. The waters are externally encircled by the fire ten times in extent:

55. The fire is externally encircled by the wind ten times in extent and the wind is externally encircled by the ether ten times in extent:

56. The wind is encircled by the ether. The ether is encircled by the ego. The ego is encircled by intellect and intellect is encircled by the unmanifest:

57-59. Sarva is stationed in the cosmic egg. O persons of good holy rites, Bhava is stationed in waters; Rudra is stationed in the middle of fire. Ugra is stationed in the wind. Bhima is stationed in the middle of the earth: Mahesvara is stationed in ego. Lord Isa is stationed in intellect. Paramesvara is stationed everywhere. The egg is encircled by the seven coverings originating from Prakrtis. These eight Prakrtis are thus stationed encircling one another:

60. Stationing themselves thus at the time of creation they attract one another. Thus mutually interdependent they uphold one another.

595. Read mabadadi for mahadayo (Linga. 1.3.18). The principle of intellect and mind and the five gross elements constitute each Egg: These seven constituents of the Egg are also known as the seven Angirases (Cf. Linga. 1.70.51) - unmanifest Prakrti (avyakta) and in

61-63. The vikaras (effects) exist in the vikarins (cause) by means of the relationship of the support and the supported: MaheSvara is beyond Avyakta. The cosmic egg is born of Avyakta: The game lord is born of the cosmic Purusa with solar lustre. In it the generating of the effect is achieved by his own free will. He alone is the primordial embodied being, called Purusa. Vignu who is bowed to by all Devas is born of his left limb.

Thanks to the wish of Paramesthin; the lord Vignu originated together with goddess Laksmi; Brahma the preceptor of the universe is born of the right limb of the lord along with Sarasvati.

65-67. These worlds are in that Cosmic egg. This universe is within the Cosmos. The moon and the sun along with the stars, planets, wind and the Lokaloka mountains are stationed within the Cosmic Egg: O Brahmins, whatever time interval is necessary for the creation I have enumerated above, that period is the daytime of Paramesvara. His night also extends over the same duration:

68-70. The period of his creation is his day and the period of dissolution his night: Really, it should be known that he has neither day nor night [as we conceive of it]. It is used metaphorically for the facility of the people:

The objects stay during the day of the lord, viz. -the sense-organs; the objects of the senses, the five great elements, all living beings, intellect and the deities:

71-73. At the end of the day they get dissolved: At the end of the night they originate again. When the unmanifest is stationed in His soul, when the effects are dissolved, both Pradhana and Purusa remain quiescent i.e. with their common characteristics, tamas, sattva and rajas in equilibrium: They remain interlinked like threads woven together in the same warp and woof:

It should be known that there is dissolution when the gunas are in equilibrium and when they are upset there is creation.

74. Just as there is oil latent in the gingelly seed, just as the ghee is present in the milk, so also the universe is present in tamas, sattva and rajas.

Various Creations
75. After enjoying the goddess throughout the night the creator begins to function in the beginning of the day when Prakrti originates from Him:

76. The great lord penetrates Pradhana and Purusa agitating them by means of yoga.

77. The three deities originate from the great lord, the lord of the Universe: They are permanent, extremely worthy of concealment and protection, embodied ones, and the souls of all.

78. These alone are the three devas, the three Gunas, the three worlds, and the three fires.

79. They are mutually supported and they devotedly follow one another. They exist on mutual help and they hold one another together and are mutually interdependent:

80. There is not even a moment's separation among them. They do not eschew one another.

81. Siva is the greatest lord; Visnu is beyond or above intellect. Brahma is endowed with rajas. He functions at the beginning of Creation.

82-87. That Purusa is known as Para and Prakrti as Para. The Prakrti which is presided over by the great lord begins to function when it is induced from all sides. The principle of intellect functions following this. Since it is permanent and stable, it resorts to the object of the sense, by itself: When there is disturbance in the Gunas (qualities) of Pradhana the period of creation functions from that which is of Existent-cum-nonexistent nature and presided over by Isvara:

Rudra became fully equipped for evolving the effects at the very outset: He is unequalled in brilliance, intelligent and illuminating: He indeed is the first embodied soul and is called.

597. When the life-principle enters into Prakrti, there occurs an agitation (Lesobbe) in the form of contraction and expansion. Out of this agitation which is a process of Coming and Going, the universal seed is created, which has both the characteristic of the male and female. For detail, see MP. 4 study, PP: 36-37.

598. Out of this agitated there come into existence the triadic principles known as Brahma, Visnu and Siva identical with three Gunas—Rajas, Tattva and Tamas: birth and joint activity of the trinity:

599. The Purines refer to the joint.

Puruta Lord Brahma, the four-lacedeo Prajapati was born of Him. He also became fully equipped for evolving the effects (i.e: creation): So, the same lord is stationed in three forms:

# 88.

He is endowed with positive knowledge and lordship: They, (i.e: the three devas) are also endowed with positive virtue and detachment: has been mentally conceived or uttered by

# 89.

Whatever them is born out of the unmanifest, since it has been made to be subservient, and since the activities are dependent on the three Gunas by nature.

# 90.

The self-born deity has three conditions in the capacity of Brahma he is the four-faced one; in the capacity of Kala (i.e Rudra) he is the destroyer; he is the thousand-headed Purusa (i.e: Vignu) also.

# 91.

In the capacity of Brahma, he creates the worlds; in the capacity of Kila, he destroys the world; in the capacity of Purusa, he is indifferent: Prajapati has three stages

# 92.

Brahma has the lustre of the interior of a lotus; Rudra is like the fire at the time of dissolution; Purusa is lotus-eyed. This is the form of the great soul.

# 93.

The lord takes up single body, two bodies, and then many bodies: He creates and destroys these bodies, and dispels them too.

# 94.

The great lord creates and destroys bodies of different shapes; activities, forms and names.

# 95.

Since he assumes three different forms, he is called Triguna: When divided into four, he is called Caturvyuha. (having four arrays)

# 96.

He is defined as atman (soul) because he attains the sense objects (Vap to attain), because he takes up (a + Vda to take up) the sense objects and because he swallows up (Vad to eat) the sense objects. Moreover, he has perpetual existence:

# 97.

He is called Rgi because he goes everywhere: He is Saririn because he is its (body's) lord. He is (called) Svamin because he possesses everything: He is called Vignu because he enters everything: he possesses Bhaga

He is called Bhagavin because

(loveliness, excellence, fortune, glory). He is called Siva because he is devoid of impurities. He is called Parama because he is distinguished and eminent: Since he protects he is called Om, knows everything.

99. He is called Sarvajna because he perfectly knows everything. He is Sarva because he is identical with all. He divides himself into three and functions in the three worlds.

100. By means of three forms he creates, swallows and protects. Since he is primordial he is called Adideva. He is called Aja because he is not born.

101. Since he protects people he is known as Prajapati. Since he is the greatest among Devas he is called Mahadeva.

102. He is Omnipresent and not subservient to Devas: Hence, he is Isvara. He is Brahma because he is massive: He is called Bhuta because of his existence.

103. He is called the knower of the field (i.e., body); he comprehends the inner organs, mind, etc. Since he is single he is called Kevala. Since he lies down in the soul he is called Purusa.

104. He is known as self-born because he has no beginning and he is prior to all: Since he is worthy of worship he is called Yajna. He is Kavi because he can see what is beyond the sense organs.

105. He is Kramana because he has access to all (or is accessible to all). He is Palaka because he protects all: He is Aditya because he is tan-coloured. Being born at the outset he is Agni (fire) because of the origin of all golden things.

106. Because he is the golden Egg, he is called Hiranyagarbha. The time that has gone by after the self-born has been in existence cannot be reckoned even in hundreds of years.

107. The first half Parardha in the age of the present Brahma has already elapsed and another period of equal duration, i.e., the second half still remains. At its end begins the dissolution of the worlds.

108. Crores and thousands of crores of the days of kalpas.

Lingopurana

have come and gone. As many yet remain: The kalpa that is current now is known as Varaha kalpa:

# 10-12.

O brahmins, this is the first kalpa (Brahma's day) within that Varahakalpa (age). In this there are fourteen Manus beginning with Svayambhuva. This entire earth consisting of the seven continents and mountains are to be protected by those great lords (i.e: the fourteen Manus) past, present and future by means of their penance and through the subjects. Listen to their detailed account:

# 13.

If one manvantara is recounted, the other manvantaras are also recounted: If one kalpa is explained, all the other kalpas too are explained.

# 14.

The past kalpas are such that leave their consequences on the future ones along with (or including) the dynastics of Kings etc. and the same reasoning should be applied to future kalpas by the knowing man (i.e., the past has left its marks on the present and in the same way the future will carry the marks of the present).

# 115-117.

The waters were in existence at the outset when the whole surface of the earth had been destroyed. In the vast quiet and sparkling waters nothing else was known. When the mobile and immobile beings are destroyed in that vast, sealike expanse of water, Brahma assumes a form with thousand eyes, thousand feet; thousand heads. He is then called Narayana. He is the golden-coloured Purusa beyond the sense organs. He had his slumber in that expanse of water.

# 118.

When sattva guna was prevalent he woke up and found the world a void: They cite this verse about Narayana.

# 119-125.

We hear that the word Nara means waters or sons of waters. He filled the void with waters and made it his resort: Since he lies down in the waters he is known as Narayana. After spending the night consisting of a thousand cycles of four yugas in the water, at the end of the night he assumed the form of Brahma for the purpose of creation. Brahma adopted gaseous form and moved about over those waters like the glowworm at night during the rainy season. He knew that the

Various Creations
The earth had gone under the water by means of inference: But he did not get disillusioned over the lifting up of the earth (from the waters). In previous eras in the beginning of the kalpas he had assumed another body. Then the lord of great soul pondered over that divine form. Seeing the earth submerged in water all round he thought, "What form shall I adopt to lift up this Earth?" He adopted the form of a boar as befitting the sport in water. The form was unassailable to all living beings: It had speech and was actually Brahman itself: He entered the nether worlds in that form for lifting up the earth.

In that boar form he approached the earth enveloped by water and quickly lifted it up.

The waters immediately filled up the oceans and the rivers: For the welfare of the worlds, the lord lifted up the earth by means of his curved fangs, the earth that had submerged and got embedded in the nether worlds. The holder of the earth, Lord Vishnu, the lifter of the earth held it, brought it to its original place and left it there as it was before: The earth stood like a great ship above that vast collection of water and on a par with it. Because of its massive body the earth did not sink and get submerged. After lifting it up the lotus-eyed lord with the desire to fit the world firmly turned his attention towards the demarcation of the earth: He made the earth level and then collected the mountains.

When everything of the previous creation was burnt by the fire at the time of dissolution the mountains got scattered over an extensive area. Due to chilliness in that vast sea-like expanse of water the scattered pieces of mountains were heaped up by the wind. Wherever they were deposited they became the stable mountains.

Mountains are called acalas because they never move, they are called parvatas because they have knots (parvans). They are giris because they are absorbed and hidden. They are called Siloccayas because they keep lying down.

Thereafter when crores of mountains were scattered about, Visvakarman the architect of the gods, divided and classified them again and again at the beginning of every kalpa: He again divided the earth into seven continents.

occans and mountains. Thercafter he cvolved the four worlds beginning with Bhuh:

138. After evolving the worlds, the self-born Brahma, the lord who was desirous of creating different subjects; began creating them at the beginning of the

139-14la. He created everything kalpa in the same manner as it was before. While he meditated on creation beginning with intellect and simultaneous with it, Illusion, ignorance identical with darkness, originated from the soul in five stages viz. tamas (darkness), moha (delusion), mahamoha (great delusion), tamisra (murkiness), and andhatamisra (blinding gloominess).

141b-143. This first creation of the meditating and self-confident lord came to stay as a fivefold one; viz. (1) those enveloped by darkness; (2) half open and half covered like the sprout from a seed; (3) those that have no light inside or outside; (4) those that are stiff and rigid; and (5) senseless: Because their intellect, miseries and senses were all enshrouded, they are called important immobiles with covered souls.

144. On seeing this first creation in that situation as well as useless for any action (being immobile) he became dissatisfied in mind, and thought about another: Tiryaksrotas creation.

145. Even as he meditated over it the (moving sideways) was developed. Since it functioned sideways it is called Tiryaksrotas.

146. The animals etc, (i.e birds and reptiles) constitute this well-known creation. O brahmins, they are those who adopt wrong paths. So he meditated on another Creation and the Sattvika creation was evolved: Ordhvasrotas.

147-148. This third creation is which is directed upwards. Since it functions upwards it is called Ordhvasrotas. The beings created under this category are mostly happy and delighted. They are enshrouded within and without as well as illuminated on both sides.

603. Avidya - the scheme of ninefold creation is mentioned in all the Purapas. It is said that the creation arose out of ignorance (avidya) clasti- (dloomined), and moha (confusion) labaroba (ducutn), Umina andhatamisra (blind gloominess).

149. Because they have been created with the union of Sattvaguna; they are known as originating from Sattva. This third creation of Ordhvasrotas is that of Devas:

150. The creations originating in the category of Ordhvasrotas are brilliant within and without: The Ordhvasrotas creations are stated by the learned to be satisfied souls.

151. When Devas, the creations in the category of Ordhvasrotas were created Brahma, the lord who grants boons, became delighted, but he still meditated on another creation.

152-153. He pondered over the creation that will be "Sadhaka" (active and fit for action). Even as he was meditating thoughtfully, the active Arvaksrotas creation manifested itself from the unmanifest Prakrti. Since it functions downwards it is called Arvaksrotas:

154. The beings created thus are mostly brilliant; rajas predominates in them and there is a mixture of tamas also. Hence; there is a predominance of misery and they do their tasks again and again:

155. They are human beings enshrouded within and without, and active: They are classified into eight categories through their redeeming feature:

156. They are men who have realized souls with attributes similar to those of Gandharvas. Thus, the creation of Arvaksrotas is called Taijasa (luminous, fiery).

157-158. The fifth creation is Anugraha (the creation of blessings) - It is fourfold according to the distinctive feature of contrariety, power; achievement and satisfaction. The contrariety inheres the beings that are immobile; the power is the element that characterizes the Tiryakyoni (animals); men are characterized by their realized souls. Of Devas and sages satisfaction is the distinctive feature:

159. This group is called Prakrta (pertaining to Prakrti). This fifth (fourfold) Vaikarika creation is the best (anavamah) among all. The creation of the origins of gross elements and the gross elements, siddhas, sages, etc.; is the sixth. The creation of the roots of creation: CI.

160-161. They (of the sixth group represented by the sages) know what has taken place in the past, what is taking place at present, and what will take place in future. These (sages, etc.) remain detached though they enjoy and share the fruits of their activities:

[62-164. This creation is characterized by contrariety and imperfection. The first (1) creation of Brahma is that of Mahat; the next (2) that of tanmatras; the third (3) is Vaikarika (i.e., of the nature of transformation and ramification). This three-fold creation was evolved prior to intelligence: (4) The primary (mukhya) creation (of insentient beings) is the fourth. The immobile beings are the mukhyas.

165. Then there are (5) tiryak (horizontal); (6) urdhva (upward) and (7) arvaksrotas (downward) creations. (8) Then comes the anugraha creation, the eighth in the serial order. It is both Sattvika and Tamasa.

166. Thus with the five vaikrta types and three prakrtas there are eight types of creation. (9) The ninth creation, i.e., of Kumaras is both prakrta and vaikrta.

167. The three prakrta creations are prior to the creation of intellect: But the other six creations (Nos. 4-9) are posterior to intellect:

168. I shall now give the detail of Anugraha sarga which you will understand properly. It stands in four ways among all living beings:

605. The text is corrupted: The commentator's interpretation is far-fetched. He explains prakrtah (V-159) prakrta-nirupana-vigayah the subject of present discourse. He dissolves vaikrto navamah vaikrtah anavamah and explains anavamah as fresthah, superior.

606. The anugraha creation is characterized by contrariety (viparyeye), power (Jakti), satisfaction (tusti) and perfection (siddhi).

The scheme of ninefold creation as outlined in the Puranas can be summarised as follows:

| (i) Mahat     | (creation of the great principle)                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (ii) Tanmatra | (creation of subtle elements)                                               |
| (iii) Bhuta   | (creation of gross elements)                                                |
| (iv) Mukhya   | (the principal creation comprising the immobile world of insentient beings) |
| (v) Tiryek    | (the animal)                                                                |

Various Creations
# 169.

The Prakrta and Vaikrta creations together are nine: The learned consider them interconnected through causes.

# 170.

At the outset, Brahma created the mental sons equal to himself: Among them Rbhu and Sanat were sages of sublimated sexuality. They were born at the outset. They were senior to all others. After the eighth kalpa was over, these two ancient ones, the witnesses of the worlds, constricted their splendour and settled themselves in the terrestrial world in the Varahakalpa. They performed such actions leading to salvation after steadying their mind in their soul. Eschewing progeny, ritualistic activities and affection, they adopted detachment. Sanat continued to have the same child-like form as at the time of his birth. Hence, his name is celebrated as Sanatkumara.

# 171-173a.

Brahma created Sananda, Sanaka and Sanatana. By means of their perfect knowledge, those sages of great power abstained from worldly acts. These yogins were enlightened in the diversity of the world and so refrained from worldly activities. Without creating progeny, they passed away at the time of dissolution. After they had gone away, Brahma created other mental sons who were fit for action and who took pride in their positions: These sages by whom this earth was sustained remained until the final dissolution of all fire.

# 178-182.

Brahma created the waters, earth, firmament, heaven, oceans, rivers, mountains, herbs, creepers, trees and plants, the units of time such as lavas, kasthas, kalas, muhurtas, junctions, nights, days, fortnights, months, ayanas (half-yearly transit of the sun), years and yugas: All these who identified themselves with these abodes are known by the names of their abodes. He created Devas and sages too. They created the following:

| (i)   | Deva (creation wherein the stream of life is horizontal) (tiryaksrotes)                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| (ii)  | Deva (creation of Devas in which the stream of life moves upwards) (ardhvasrotas)                                                          |
| (iii) | Minuta (creation of mankind in which the stream of life moves downwards) (arvak-trotas)                                                    |
| (iv)  | Creation of Feeling such as propriety, Power, satisfaction and perfection found respectively in immobile, mobile, human and divine beings. |

This type of creation (Nos iv-viii), born of intelligence, is said to be secondary; but it includes snugraha in the primary creation: (ir) Kumara's creation of the mental and secondary: to be both primary.

werc Marici, Bhrgu; Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Dakea, Atri and Vasietha. Brahma created these nine sons mentally. They are stipulated in the Puranas as the Nine Brahmas.

As belore; the lotus-born deity assigned abodes to all the expounders of Brahman, who were equal to Brahma himself:

Then the lord created Samkalpa and Dharma: Dharma through enterprise and Samkalpa out of determination: Then another mental son Ruci was born of lord Brahma.

Brahma created Daksa from his vital breath and Marici from his eyes. Bhrgu was born of the heart of Brahma. He created Angiras from his head and Atri from his ears. He created Pulastya from the organic wind Udana and Pulaha from the wind Vyana. Vasistha was born of Samana: He created Kratu from Apana. Thus these divine sons of Brahma are eleven altogether. Dharma are the first born sons of Brahma.

Bhrgu etc. expounders of Brahman: They were ancient householders who propagated Dharma. Among them, twelve were the lords of Devas. Their dynasties were divine, endowed with sattvic qualities. They were active, had good progenies and were adorned among the.

Rbhu and Sanatkumara were sages of sublimated sexuality: They were first born and therefore senior to all others. When the eighth kalpa had elapsed these ancient sages, the cosmic witnesses, shone in the world after constricting their splendour: Both of them did abide, by performing yogic rites after super-imposing the individual soul over the supreme soul. Eschewing progeny, worldly rites and affection they adopted detachment: Sanat continued to have the child-like form. Hence his name has been stabilised as Sanat:

Thereafter, as he (Brahma) continued his meditation, mental sons were born to him; Individual souls were born out of the body of that intelligent lord through the cause and effect process:

Thereafter he was desirous of creating the four groups; viz. Devas, Asuras; Pitra and human beings. He infused.

Various Creations
himself in the waters Even as he did $0, cven as he assiduously meditated on creation, the particles of darkness grew up in excess. Then out of his buttocks were produced the Asuras. The word 'asu' means vital breath: Those born of the vital breath are called Asuras.

200. And he then eschewed that body whereby the Asuras were created and cast it off. It then became Night:

201. Since Night is mostly constituted of darkness it is something that restricts movement. The subjects enveloped in darkness, sleep at night.

202-203. After creating the Asuras he took up another body: It was unmanifest and it mostly consisted of the quality of goodness. So he adored it. Even as he united that body in yogic activities he was pleased: Then from his shining mouth were born Devas.

204-205. Since they were born of him even as he was shining they are called Devas (shining ones). The root 'Div' means 'to play'. Therefore, Devas were born sportingly. After creating them the lord of Devas took another body:

206. That body was cast off by him and when cast off it became day: Hence, Devas adore the day that consists of Dharma:

207-209. Then he took up another body characterized by the quality of goodness. The lord considered himself like a father meditating on sons. Hence, the Pitrs were born in between the night and day from his two sides. Hence, Devas are the Pitrs and their state of being Pitrs is due to that: He cast off that body too. That body cast off by him, immediately became the Twilight: day pertains to Devas and the night to Asuras.

210-241. The two is stationed the body that belongs to Asuras. In between the Pitra. Hence, all Devas, Asuras, sages and men adore the body that lies in between night and day:

212-213. Then Brahma adopted another body characterized by the particle of passion: The lord created with his mind the mental sons of passionate activities. Thereby, the passionate sons were born of him.

214-215a. After creating them he cast off that body: That body cast off by him; immediately became moonlight: That is why the people become delighted when moonlight spreads:

324 Lingapurena

215b-216. Thus the bodics cast off by that noble sul became immediately night, day, the morning twilight and evening twilight and moonlight: The moonlight, the twilight and the day, these three consist of the quality of goodness.

217-218a. The night is characterized by the quality of darkness. Hence it is called Nisa. Because Devas were created by day, through pleasure and out of Brahma's mouth, they are said to be dayborn and powerful by day.

218b-220. The lord created Asuras by night from his loins. That body of the lord became night: Since they were born at night the Asuras are powerful by night. These times become the causes for all (past and) future Devas, Asuras, Pitrs and human beings in all past and future manvantaras.

221-224. The morning twilight, night, day and evening twilight, these four are the bodies of Brahma. They are called 'Ambhamsi'. The root bha means to 'shine'. The word Ambhamsi is traced by the learned to this root: After creating these, Prajapati created Devas, human beings, Danavas and Pitrs from his body. Thereafter he foresook that body which turned into moonlight and assumed another form characterized by passion and darkness: The lord created other beings during the night; these beings were overwhelmed with hunger.

225-228. These hungry beings created by him attempted to seize the bodies of the lord. Some of them who said, 'We will protect these bodies' were known as Raksasas. They were night-walkers who were overcome by hunger: Those who said, 'We will eat them up,' were called yaksas as also guhyakas because of their secret activity. The root 'raks' means 'to protect' and the root 'yaks' means 'to eat'. On observing this creation, the hair of the intelligent lord Brahma became withered due to displeasure:

229-233a. Those of the withered hair that slipped off his head and glided downward became snakes. Since they were defective they are known as Ahis. Since they fell from his head they are known as Pannagas and they are Sarpas because they creep. The fire of his terrible anger turned into poison and entered the serpents; that is why they are born along with poison. After creating the serpents the angry lord created other irate souls, who looked savage in their tawny colour:

Various Creations
They were fierce and fascinating goblins. Since they came into being they are known as Bhut and as Pisacas because they ate flesh: singing2336-234. From him then were born the Gandharvas joyously. The root Dhai means to imbibe: They were born even as they were imbibing speech: Hence they are known as Gandharvas.

After these eight divine beings had been created that lord created birds from his own youthful stage out of his own inclination. Since they are able to move as they please are known as such. They are named Vayas birds because they were created from his youth: After creating the animals the lord of Devas created the flocks of winged animals.

He created goats from his mouth; he created sheep from his chest; he created cows and bulls from his belly and sides. From his feet he created horses, elephants, donkeys, deer, camels, mules and other kinds and classes of beasts. Plants and fruit trees were produced from the hair of his body. After creating the cattle and plants, he engaged himself in sacrifice.

They call these the domesticated animals, viz. the cow, the bull, the man, the ram, the horse, the mule, the donkey. Understand the wild animals.

They call these the wild animals, viz. the beasts of prey, the cloven hoofed elephants, monkeys, fifthly, birds, sixthly, aquatic beasts and seventhly, the reptiles. The following seven are forest animals, viz.-buffaloes, gavayas (a species of ox), bears, monkeys, Sarabhas (the fabulous animal of eight feet), wolves, and lions.

From his front face he created Gayatri and the Mantras, Trivrt Saman, Rathantara and Agnistoma verses.

From his southern face he created Yajur hymns, Tristubh metre, Pancadasama Stoman, brhat Saman and Ukthya verses:

From his western face he created Siman, the metre Jagati, Saptadatama Stoman, Vairupa Saman and Atiratra verses.

From his northern face he created the set of twenty

# 326 Linigopurina

Onc Atharvan hymns, Aptoryama, Anustubh metre and the Vairaja metre.

247. At the beginning of the kalpa the lord created the lightning, the thunderbolts, the clouds, the reddy rainbows and the luminaries: living beings.

248. The high and the low were born from his limbs.

249-250. After creating the four groups, viz. Devas, Asuras, human beings and Pitrs he created beings, mobile and immobile: Jacas, Gandharvas, Apsarases, Naras, Kinnaras, Yaksas, Raksasas, birds, cattle, wild animals and snakes.

251-261. There are mobile and immobile as well as changing and unchanging created beings: Whatever activities they had in a previous creation they resume the same activities in succeeding creations. They have the same nature, etc: whether savage or timid, kind or cruel, righteous or evil, true or false. Urged by their attributes they adopt and take pleasure in their respective qualities.

When the great elements - the objects of the senses - their forms were created, the creator himself settled the application of the elements as objects of the sense organs. Some men say that human effort is the cause of various activities; others say that it is divine fate: The materialists say that it is Nature: But really manly effort, working of fate and nature all depend on the nature of the fruit or result: They know that none of these by itself is superior to the other nor can one be separated from the other. This is their nature. They cannot be all one nor are they two together, because they have separate entities.

Those who abide by activities may call that result contrary, those who abide by the quality of goodness observe impartial outlook names and forms of the elements and the further development of the created ones were evolved by the great lord at the beginning itself through the words of the Vedas.

607. The Purāṇas assign the division of society and the distribution of functions to the primeval being - Mahatvara; Cf: yajuo janturanlioyam Itmanah rukhadunkhayoh Iivara-prerito gacchet svargam parabam cve (cited in ST).

Various Creations
lord assigns names and activities in regard to the Vedas, to the sages born at the end of the night of dissolution in the same manner as before. Such are the creations of Brahmi of unmanifest origin. The mobile and immobile beings created through his mental perfection are seen at the end of his night. They resort to the mental perfection. When these excellent subjects created by him did not prosper, Brahma who had been enveloped by the quality of darkness became miserable with grief:

262-263a. Thereupon, he applied his intellect to come to a fixed decision. Then he saw within his mind that the particles of darkness were the controlling factors eschewing both the particles of goodness and passion.

2636-264. Therefore; the lord of the universe was miserable due to that sorrow. Then he prodded the tamas, and rajas and covered both with sattva: The tamas thus prodded became twin.

265-267. Adharma (sin) was born of tamas and Himsa (violence) was born of grief: When this pair of terrible nature originated, the life (vital breaths) left the lord and pleasure resorted to him. Then Brahma eschewed his shining body and bifurcated it. With one half of his body he became a man. With the other half he created a woman Satarupa.

268. With love the lord created Prakrti, the mother of the elements. With her greatness she stood pervading heaven and earth.

269-270. The first half of the body of Brahma envelopes heaven and stays there: The woman Satarupa born out of the other half performed difficult penance for hundred thousand years and obtained a man of brilliant renown as her husband:

271. That man is at the outset called Manu the self-born. Seventy sets of four yugas constitute his manvantara.

272. That man obtained as his wife Satarupa who was not born of a womb. He sported with her. Hence, she is called Rati (pleasure):

608. The Purana speak of Brahma splitting his body into two parts.

328 Lirigopurana

273. The first mutual relation of two souls took place at the beginning of the kalpa when Brahma created Virat: He became the Virat (massive) Purusa.

274. Satarupa was the empress. The son of Virat is Svayambhuva was known as Manu. Manu Vairaja created the subjects. From the heroic son of Virat (i.e Vairaja) Satarupa gave birth to two sons Priyavrata and Uttanapada who were honoured by the worlds.

275. She gave birth to two blessed daughters from whom the subjects of the world were born. They also were the gentleladies Akiti and Prasuti.

276. The lord Svayambhuva Manu gave Prasuti to Daksa. Daksa should be known as Prana (vital breath); Manu is Sankalpa (Idea):

278-279. He gave Akuti to Ruci the Prajapati, Ruci the mental son of Brahma begot auspicious twins of Akuti. Yajna and Daksina were born as twins = Yajna begot of Daksina twelve sons.

280. The devas called yamas were born as his sons in the Svayambhuva manvantara. Hence; they too are known as Yamas: Two groups, the Ajitas and the Sukras were created by Brahma. The Yamas who were born at the outset became heaven-dwellers.

281. Lord Daksa begot of Prasuti; the daughter of Svayambhuva, twenty-four daughters who became the mothers of the worlds.

282. All of them were highly blessed, lotus-eyed, pleasure-seeking and yogic mothers, expounders of the Brahman.

284-285. All of them were well as mothers of the universe: Lord Dharma took as his wives thirteen of the daughters of Daksa, viz: Sraddha (faith), Lakemi (fortune), Dhrti (fortitude), Tusti (satisfaction), Pusti (nourishment), Medha (intellect), Kriya (rituals), Buddhi (wisdom), Lajja (bashfulness), Vapuh (beauty), Santi (peace), Siddhi (achievement) and Kirti (renown) the thirteen.

286-292. The lord Dharma took these daughters of Daksa.

as his wives. Their younger sisters were the eleven splendid ladies, viz- Sati, Khyati, Sambhuti, Smrti, Priti, Ksama, Sannati, Anasuya, Urja, Svaha and Svadha. Other great sages took them as their wives - they were Rudra, Bhrgu, Marici, Angiras, Pulaha, Kratu, Pulastya, Atri, Vasistha, Vahni and the Pitrs. He gave Sati to Bhava; Khyati to Bhrgu; Sambhuti to Marici; Smrti to Angiras, Priti to Pulastya; Ksama to Pulaha, Sannati to Kratu, Anasuya to Atri; Urja to Vasistha, Svaha to Agni and Svadha to the Pitrs: All these ladies were highly blessed; they closely followed their progeny in all the manvantaras until the dissolution of all living beings: Now listen to their progeny.

293-298. Sraddha gave birth to Kima: Darpa was the son of Laksmi; Niyama of Dhrti; Santosa of Tusti; Lobha of Pushti; Sruta of Medha; Danda and Samaya were born as the sons of Kriya; Bodha and Pramada of Buddhi; Vinaya (Humility) was born of Lajja; Vyavasaya (Enterprise) of Vapus; Ksema of Santi; Sukha of Siddhi and Yasah of Kirti - these were the offspring of Dharma: Harsa was Kama's son born of the gentle lady Priti. Thus, the creation of Dharma has been recounted: Himsa bore to Adharma, Nikrti and Anrta.

299-302. Pairs of twins were born of Nikrti: Bhaya and Naraka; Maya and Vedana. Maya gave birth to Mrtyu, the dispeller of living beings. Raurava got a son of Vedana called Duhkha. From Mrtyu were born Vyadhi, Jara, Soka, Krodha and Asuya. All these ending with Duhkha had the characteristics of Adharma. These had no wives nor sons. They live in perpetual chastity: Thus, the Tamasa creation was evolved with Adharma as the controlling factor.

303-304. Nilalohita was given the direction by Brahma to create the subjects. Medie on his wife Sati he created thousands of hide-clad beings as his mental sons who were neither superior nor inferior but equal to him.

305-313. They were all equal to him in form, splendour, strength and learning: They were tawny-coloured. They were equipped with quivers. They had their matted hairs of reddish hue: They were having special features. Their hairs were greenish. They held skulls. They could kill with their eyes. They had massive figures. They were deformed.

had universal forms. They had his own forms. They had chariots, shields, coats of mail, and protective front-fenders in their chariots. They had hundreds and thousands of arms. They could go to heaven, firmament as well as walk over the earth. They had stout heads, eight curved fangs, two tongues and three eyes. They were eaters of cooked food. Some were eaters of flesh, some imbibers of ghee and some drinkers of Soma juice. Some were bountiful; some had great skulls; some were blue-necked: They had sublimated their sexuality. They were partakers of offerings; they were conversant with Dharma. They were virtuous and adorned with peacock feathers fixed to their clubs. They were seated, they were running in groups of five and there were thousands of such groups; some were teachers and some students; others performed japas and yogic practices; some emitted smoke and blazed; some lived on rivers; some were very bright; others were intelligent; they engrossed in meditation on Brahman; they were of auspicious visions; they were blue-necked; they had thousand eyes; they were mines of mercifulness and patience; they were invisible to living beings; they had great yogic practices; they had great powers and splendour: Thousands of them roamed about, rushed on and jumped up here and there: He created these excellent beings; the Rudras, even before a Yama (a period of 3 hours) had elapsed.

On seeing him (i.e. Rudra) Brahma spoke to him: Do not create subjects like these: O lord, do not create subjects equal to yourself. Obeisance be to you! Welfare unto you. Create subjects endowed with death: Subjects devoid of death will not start holy rites:

On being urged thus, he told him: I will not create the subjects equipped with death and old age. Welfare unto you. I am standing by; you create the subjects yourself: These beings of great strength will be known by the name 'Rudras'. They will resort to the earth, firmament and all quarters.

A hundred Rudras will be devoted to sacrifice: They will partake offerings in sacrifices along with the groups of Devas.

They will stay till the end of a yuga. They will be worshipped along with Devas in different manvantaras.

314-317.

320. Thus addressed by the intelligent lord, Brahma the delighted patriarch bowed down to him and replied.

321. "O lord, welfare unto You. Let it be even as it had been mentioned by you: When it was approved by Brahma, everything happened in that manner.

322-324. Ever since that day - the lord of Devas (i.e., Rudra) did not procreate progeny. He remained as Sthanu with sublimated sexuality till the time of Dissolution. Since lord Mahadeva, the Purusa shining like the sun said "I am staying" he is known as Sthanu (motionless).

325. He has the female form in one half of his body: In splendour he is comparable to the fire. By his own will he divided himself into two, a separate woman, and a separate man.

326-327. The same lord stationed himself in eleven halves. The great goddess mentioned before as the highly blessed lady sharing half the body of the lord became Sati for the welfare of the worlds. The goddess had been formerly propitiated by Daksa.

328-329. For the sake of creation, divide yourself into two, right half being white and the left black. On being asked thus by lord Siva, O brahmins, she bifurcated herself into white and black. I shall mention her names; listen attentively. They are: Svaha, Svadha, Mahavidya, Medha, Lakshmi, Sarasvati, Sati, Daksayani, Vidya, Iccha Sakti, Kriyatmika, Aparna, Ekaparna; Ekapatali, Uma, Haimavati, Kalyani, Ekamatrka, Khyati, Prajna Mahabhaga, Gauri, Ganambika, Mahadevi; Nandini, and Jatavedasi. These are some of the names when she was one (i.e., before division). After she had divided into two, her names are: Savitri, Varada, Punya, Pavani, Lokarisruta, Ajia, Avesani, Krsna, Tamasi, Sattviki, Siva, Prakrti, Vikrta, Raudri, Durga, Bhadra, Pramathini, Kalaratri, Mahimaya, Revati, Bhutanayika.

At the end of Dvapara yuga, sages of holy rites, her names are as follows:

Statement of NandikeSvara

# CHAPTER SEVENTYONE

# The statement of NandikeSvara

The sages said:

The splendid process of creation has been mentioned succinctly and in detail by you. How did Pasupati, MahcSvara happen to burn the three cities of Asuras?

O holy lord, how did Devas including Brahma become Pasus? The set of cities was formerly built by Maya by performing penance: It was an excellent set of three cities of divine nature, made of gold, silver and iron. We have heard that these along with their forts were burned by the lord of Devas. How did the lord who struck down the eyes of Bhaga burn these cities by discharging a single arrow even though it was divine, not burned by the goblins?

That set of three cities was created by Visnu. The entire details of the origin of the cities and the acquisition of boons have been heard formerly:

O sage of good holy rites, it behoves you to narrate the burning of the cities wholly.

On hearing their words, Suta, the most excellent among the knowers of the Purinas, said what he had heard from Vyasa in the manner as he had indicated all the necessary topics.

Sita said:

Due to the curse of the three worlds originating from mind, speech and body, the asura Taraka, the son of Tara, was killed along with his kinsmen by Skanda assiduously. His sons, all of noble soul, great strength and exploits, viz: Vidyunmalin, Tarakaksa and Kamalakga, performed penance:

Those excellent Danavas, while performing fierce penance, observed great restraints. By means of penance they emaciated their bodies. The delighted Brahma, the bestower of boons granted them the boon of their choice:

The Daibyas said: We want not to be killed by any living at any time.

Thus they jointly requested the grandfather of all worlds. Then the eternal lord of the worlds spoke to them thus:

13. "O Asuras, there is no universal immortality. Desist from this desire; Choose another boon that may appeal to you.

14. Then the Daityas after consulting one another bowed to Brahma; the preceptor of the universe and said to him:

15. "By your grace, O lord of worlds, O preceptor of the universe, we shall roam over this earth and live in three cities.

16. Once in thousand years we shall meet together. O sinless one, these cities shall then fuse into one city.

17. The lord who strikes at these when they have fused into one with a single arrow shall be death unto us.

18. Replying, "It be so," the lord entered the heaven. Thereafter the heroic Maya built the cities by means of his penance.

19. The cities of those noble asuras were stationed as follows: the golden one was in the heaven; the silver city was in the firmament and the iron city was on the earth.

20-22. Each of these cities was a hundred yojanas in length and in breadth: The city of Tarakaksa was made of gold; the city of Kamalaksa was made of silver; that of Vidyunmali was made of iron; they had three types of excellent forts. Maya was worshipped by the Daityas and Danavas there. This powerful architect built his own abode in every one of them and lived there.

23. Thus, O men of good holy rites, came into existence the well-fortified three cities. O leading brahmins, they were like the three worlds.

24. When the trio of cities grew up, the Daityas in the three worlds entered the three cities and became superior in strength.

25. The cities were full of kalpa trees. They also sounded in elephants and horses. There were innumerable mansions richly decorated with clusters of jewels:

26-27. There were aerial chariots that resembled the solar kalpa-druma—one of the five trees of Indra paradise fabled to fulfill all desires, the other being Mandara, Parijataka, Santana and Haricandana.

disc and that had faces on every side: The palaces were splendid did with rubies studded: They were as relulgent as the moon. Their ornamental gateways were divine and resembled the peaks of Kailasa. Their three cities shone with the excellent mansions built separately.

28. O excellent brahmins, it was filled with divine ladies (i.e: ladies of divine beauty and excellence) - Gandharvas, Siddhas and Caranas. There were shrines of Rudra in every house and Agnihotra was performed every day:

29-37. They were filled with wells, tanks, large oblong lakes all round - Herds of elephants in their rut; splendid horses, chariots of every shape, wonderfully made with faces on all sides - all these abounded there. There were drinking sheds, assemblies, playgrounds, etc. Different kinds of halls and chambers for the study of the Vedas were found all round: The cities were well fortified and made unassailable even mentally by others, due to the illusionary power of Maya. O leading sages, the cities were frequented by chaste ladies everywhere: There were many Daityas. Although they committed great sins they got rid of them through their worship of Sankara. O brahmins, the leading Daityas were highly blessed: They were accompanied by their wives and sons. They were conversant with the holy rites laid down in the Srutis and Smrtis. They were engaged in those virtuous rites always. They abandoned all lords other than Mahadeva and were engaged in the worship of that lord alone. They had broad chests and shoulders like those of bulls. They used to hold all weapons. They were always hungry. Their eyes shone like the forest fire: Some of them were quiescent; some were infuriated. Some were dwarfish and some were hump-backed; they had the lustre of blue lotuses; their hairs were dark coloured and curly: They resembled the blue mountain and the Meru; their voice was comparable to the sound of the rumbling cloud: All of them were protected by Maya. They were well-trained and were desirous of fighting: That trio of cities was well frequented by the firm and steadfast suppressors of Devas (i.e: Daityas) who were interested in fighting always and all round, who had perfectly achieved prowess and virility by the worship of Siva and who resembled the sun, wind and king of immortal beings:

0 excellent brahmins, thanks to the prowess of the Daityas; Devas including Indra were burned by the fire of the set of three cities like the trees consumed by the forest fire:

Devas who were thus scorched saluted lord Visnu of unrivalled splendour and said to him.

The glorious lord, Narayana thought within his mind as to what should be done in the affairs of Devas. Janardana, whose form is sacrifice; who was himself the performer of sacrifices, who was the partaker of the fruit of sacrifices and who is the lord and bestower of benefits unto those who perform sacrifices, remembered the sacrifice:

The sacrifice remembered by him for the achievement of the objects of Devas bowed down to that lord and eulogised him.

Seeing the smiling sacrifice; the eternal lord Visnu observed Devas including Indra and said:

Sri Visnu said:

For the destruction of the three cities and for the prosperity of the three worlds, O Devas, worship the lord with the Upasad sacrifice:

Suta said:

On hearing the words of the intelligent lord of Devas, Devas made great leonine roaring sound and eulogised the lord of sacrifices.

Thereafter, lord Vispu himself thought once again. The lord of Devas again spoke to all Devas:

Even after killing and burning all living beings and even after enjoying pleasures without the basic justice, if one worships Mahadeva, one is undoubtedly sinless:

There is no doubt that sinless persons should not be killed and only sinners should be killed assiduously. O excellent Devas, how could the wicked Asuras be killed by Devas although they are sinners and Devas are very strong? Hence they should not be killed due to the power of Rudra Paramesthin.

Without the grace of the lord who am I? O Devas,

Statement of Nandikesvara

who is Brahma? Who are the Daityas? Who are the slayers of the enemies of Devas? Who are the noble-souled sages?

51. He is the lord, greater than the greatest: He is perpetual; he is the twenty-seventh principle; who is worthy of being saluted, who is the lord of all the immortal beings in the universe and who is Mahesvara, the support of the universe.

52. He alone is the lord of all Devas. He is the benefactor of all. He has made a distinction between Devas and Daityas sportingly.

53. It is by worshipping a part of himself that Devas attained immortality; Brahma attained his status as Brahma and I attained my status as Visnu.

54. Without worshipping him, which man attains perfection in this world? Thanks to the worship of Linga, they could be killed by him alone.

55-56. Moreover, all of them abide by their Dharmas. They adhere to the injunctions of Sruti and Smrti. Still we shall worship Rudra by performing the rite of Upasad pertaining to that lord and become victorious over the excellent Daityas. Excepting the sole lord, the three-eyed deity, who else is competent to destroy the Tripuras? They are well protected by Maya along with Tirakaksa. They have the sole lustre of crystals and they are well stationed in themselves.

Sita said:

57. After saying this, Visnu performed the worship of the lord by means of Upasad sacrifice. Sitting there he saw thousands of goblins.

58-59. They were armed with spears, javelins and iron clubs. They had various weapons; they were in various guises. They resembled Rudra fierce as the fire at the time of dissolution; they were comparable to Rudra the destroyer: They bowed to him and halted. Lord Visnu then spoke to them.

Visnu said:

1. "0 heroic ones, go to the three cities of Daityas, burn them, split them and swallow them. Then return to the surface of the earth in the manner you had gone:
2. Thereafter, the groups of goblins bowed down to the lord of Devas and entered the three cities. Like the moths in fire, they became destroyed.
3. At the behest of the lord of Daityas, all the goblins were destroyed: Thousands of Daityas rejoiced, danced and sang: They eulogised Rudra the lord of Devas, the great soul:
4. Devas including Indra, who had been defeated in trice and whose prowess had been destroyed, came unto Visnu, the lord of Devas and resorted to his support out of fear. On seeing them the lord Visnu thought thus:
5. (What is to be done?) After thinking thus he became distressed as he looked at the distressed Devas including Indra: After a while He thought again (How shall I destroy the army of Daityas assiduously and carry out the tasks of Devas without the grace of the supreme lord. If one ponders over it, there is no doubt about this that those who are virtuous have no sin at all. Daityas
6. Hence, know that the cannot be killed by those Bhutas originating from the Upasad sacrifice: They dissin by means of Dharma. Everything is founded on Dharma. The eternal Sruti says that prosperity originates from Dharma. All these Daityas, the residents of the three cities, are virtuous: Hence, 0 leading brahmins, they have attained immortality and not otherwise. Even after committing a very great sin, people are liberated from all the sins if they worship Rudra. They are not affected by sins like the lotus leaves which are not affected by water. 0 brahmins, the achievement of worldly pleasures definitely takes place through his worship. Hence, those Daityas who are devoted to the worship of the Linga do enjoy worldly pleasures: Hence, 0 Devas, for your purpose I shall create obstacles in the holy rites of Daityas by means of my Maya and so shall conquer the three cities instantaneously."

Sita said: thinking thus, the lord Visnu decided to bring about impediments in the holy rituals of asuras.

73. Visnu of great splendour, wielding Maya generated an illusory Purusa born of himself to create obstacles to the holy rites of Daityas.

74. Visnu the ruler of all, the person who could assume any form he liked, the wielder of Maya; evolved a holy treatise that could fascinate everyone and that had within its basic principles the belief in what is seen.

75. This sacred treatise contained one million six hundred thousand verses. Lord Visnu taught this scripture to the Purusa born of his own limbs.

76-77. It was against those treatises that followed the Srutis and the Smrtis. It was devoid of the discipline pertaining to the four castes and four stages of life. It was taught in it that heaven and hell are here itself. There was no belief otherwise: Visnu himself taught this scripture to that Purusa. For the destruction of the three cities he said to that Purusa,

78. "O, undoubtedly it behoves you to go there for the quick destruction of the residents of the three cities: May their Dharmas in pursuit of the Srutis and Smrtis be destroyed."

79. The wielder of Maya, the expert in the deceptive scripture, bowed to him. After entering those cities the sage immediately created his Maya. Daityas who

80. On account of his Maya, those were the residents of the three cities, eschewed their holy rites based on the Srutis and Smrtis and became his disciples.

81-82. They left off Sankara, Mahadeva, the great Isvara.

613. According to the present context, Visnu created a delusive teacher called Mayamoha who created Mayasastra of sixteen lakhs of verses preaching a-dharma for misguiding the Asuras. Mayamoha created disciples for the propagation of a-dharma; He preached non-violence, forbade Srauta and Smarta rituals, discarded Varvasrama system, created an order living their home and leading the life of nuns for women that resulted in lea.

In some versions, the role is assigned to Brihaspati, the preceptor of Gods who in the guise of the preceptor Sukra deludes the Asuras: For detail, see Mayamoha prakarava in Padma, Visnu, Matsya and Stva puranas.

At the behest of the lord, the wielder of Maya, Narada, the practitioner of deception, also entered the trio of cities and associated himself with the wielder of Maya. That sage was himself surrounded on all sides by his disciples and their disciples: He ordained rules of conduct for women that would give them the benefit of licentious activities. They followed those rules and achieved the result immediately: These women began to censure the ladies faithful to their husbands and themselves became enamoured of other people: Even today in the Kali age, base women give due honour to the sage Narada, abandon their husbands and move about unfettered. Really it is the husband who is mother, father, kinsman, comrade, friend and relative unto the women. There is no doubt about this. Still he said thus through his Maya. Really the woman who has love towards her husband shall attain the greatest heaven even after committing great sin. She who does contrary to this attains hell.

O leading sages, formerly, chaste ladies forsook all Dharmas, all Devas and other preceptors of the universe and worshipped their husbands always. After attaining the heavenly world they became free from ailments and rejoiced. But those who were the followers of Maya attained hell. Hence, it is the husband who is the greatest goal.

Yet on account of the Maya of the lord of Devas and at the behest of lord Visnu, the women abandoned their husbands and became self-willed and unrestrained in their conducts. Misfortune went to the three cities at the behest of that lord himself: The glory and prosperity that they had obtained from Brahma, the unborn lord; the lord of Devas, abandoned them and went out of the cities.

The lord thus preached delusion of the intellect as evolved by the Maya of Visnu. The Purusa deluded the Daityas and Narada the wielder of Maya deluded the ladies: In order to create obstacles in Dharmas these two were comfortably seated there. They were unexcited and unchanging.

The preaching in regard to sexual freedom is attributed to Narada, the disciple of Mayamoba.

Statement of Nandikesvara
when the splendid Dharma pertaining to the Srutis and the Smrtis, perished; when heresy was proclaimed by Visnu, the source of origin of the universe; when Mahesvara and the worship of his Linga were abandoned by Daityas; when the virtuous activities of the women were entirely destroyed and wicked conduct was stabilised; the lord of Devas Visnu appeared contented: After practising penance he approached the consort of Uma along with Devas and eulogised him. Lord Visnu said

Obeisance to you, to Lord Mahesvara, to the great Atman; obeisance to Narayana; to Sarva, to Brahma, to one having the form of Brahman; obeisance to the permanent one, to the infinite one; to the unmanifest one.

Suta said:

98-99. After eulogising the great lord and after bowing down like a longstaff, the lord Visnu stationed himself in water and performed the japa of the Rudra Mantra ten million times. All Devas including Indra; Sadhyas, Yama, Rudras and Maruts eulogised lord Siva.

Devas said

100 - Obeisance to you the Atman of all; obeisance to Sankara the dispeller of affliction, to Rudra, to Nila Rudra, to Kadrudra and to Pracetas.

101 - You are our perpetual goal; the suppressor of the enemies of Devas should be always worshipped and honoured by us: You are the primordial one; you are the endless one; you are the infinite imperishable lord:

103-104. You are the granter of boons; you are identical with speech: You are worthy of being directly expressed; you are devoid of the expressed and expression. For the sake of salvation, you are worshipped by the yogins and by those who whirl in the yogic practice: You are stationed in the

105. O lord, the noble sages say that you are reality, the mass of splendour, greater than the greatest and the greatest Atman in this world:

106. O preceptor of the universe, you are everything that is seen, heard, stationed or born. They call you minuter than the minutes and greater than the greatest:

107. They call you one with hands and feet everywhere, one with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere. You have ears all round and you stand enveloping everything in the world:

108-110. They call you Mahadeva, the omniscient; one without ailment; one who cannot be specifically pointed out, one having universal form, one with deformed eyes, Sadasiva without ailment; one who makes others in the world function, one who makes Prakrti work, the great-grandfather, the lord who bestows boons, the self-born deity, the abode of all and the lord of twenty-six principles. You resemble ten million Suns in refulgence; you are similar to ten million moons in brightness, you are on a par with ten million fires that blaze at the time of dissolution and you have no other lord to control you.

111-144. The Srutis and the people who are conversant with the essence of Srutis call you the essence of the Srutis. O deity with many forms, that which is evolved in the world without you has not been seen by us. You alone protect the Daityas, Devas, Bhutas, the mobile and immobile beings, O Sambhu; we have no other goal. Protect us by killing all the Asuras.

Paramesvara, all are deluded by your Maya. Just as the waves and billows in the ocean come into clash with one another and ultimately become water, so also Devas and Asuras and all creations of Brahma (fighting one another) are rendered insentient by the lord [a pun on the word jala water) which is also pronounced as jada when it means insentient; inactive]:

Glancing at Devas, he said in majestic tone: S0 leading Devas, this task has been understood by me now.

At the behest of Mahadeva Nandisa, the favourite sage of the lord came there riding on a white bull: He had matted hair and held the trident and the iron club: He wore garlands, necklaces, ear-rings and bangles. On seeing Nandin, the Kumbhodara bowed to Nandin with his lowered head and hastened along with him. Nandin of great splendour was seated on the back of a bull. He had the bull banner. He was the commander-in-chief of the Ganas and was accompanied by the Ganas like the great lord himself, riding on the back of the cloud. The white umbrella of Nandin stretched to ten Yojanas. It was bedecked in clusters of pearls. It shone like the firmament: The splendid pearl necklace suspended from it from within appeared like the Ganga falling from the sky over the head of the lord.

Satisfied with that shower he shone with real and sincere satisfaction. Nandin was drenched in fragrant water dropping from the moon on the forehead of the lord: The back of the bull shone with different kinds of flowers. O sages of good holy rites, just as the firmament is scattered with stars so also the back of the bull was covered with flowers. Covered by them Nandin shone on the back of the bull, like the moon on the back of the firmament.

Then the Devas strenuously made the chariot through their artificer Visvakarman assisted by Brahma, for the use of Siva the intelligent lord of Devas.

# CHAPTER SEVENTYTwo

# Construction of Rudra's Chariot

With great assiduity and eagerness the divine and cosmic chariot of lord Rudra was made by Visvakarman:

It was identical with all living beings; it was bowed to by all Devas; it was identical with all Devas; it was golden and it was honoured by all.

The sun was the right wheel and the moon was the left wheel. The right wheel had twelve spokes and the left wheel had sixteen spokes.

O leading brahmins, the twelve Adityas were in those twelve spokes on the right; O sages of good holy rites, in the sixteen spokes of the left wheel were the sixteen digits of the moon.

The constellations were the ornaments of the left wheel alone. The six seasons were the rims of those two wheels, O leading brahmins.

The firmament was the roof; the interior of the chariot was the Mandara. The mountain of rising sun and the mountain of the setting sun were the poles to which the yoke was fixed:

Mahameru was the pedestal and the mountain Kesara was the supporting seat: The year was its velocity and the two transits of the sun were the joints of the wheels.

The Muhurtas were holes to fix the nails.

In the Purapas, Vifvakarman is invested with the power and offices of the Vedic Tvastṛ. He is the great architect, executor of handicrafts and the builder of great cities. He is the son of Prabhas, the eighth Vasu; by his wife Yogasiddha.

The cosmic chariot represents the cosmic powers with seven worlds as wheels, with five gross elements and all gods as its constituents.

Vima i.e. the moon; the left side of the cosmic chariot.

Puskara - vacuum, it stands in apposition to antarikta - the atmospheric region, the sky.

Ratha-nideh - Sirathi-sthanam, the place for the charioteer.

# Lingapurana

Kalas were the pins of the yoke: The Kasthas were its nostrils and the Ksanas were its axles.

The Nimesas were its Axle-tree and the Lavas constituted its shafts: The sky was the fender of that chariot. The heaven and salvation were its flags.

Virtue and detachment were its staffs and were the supports of the staffs: The monetary gifts were the joints and the fifty fires were the iron pieces or bolts.

Dharma and Kama (love) were the tips of the two yokes; the unmanifest principle was the poleshaft; the cosmic intellect was its connecting shaft.

The ego was its angular points; the elements were its strength; the sense organs its ornamental fittings all round.

Sraddha (faith) was its movement; the Vedas were its horses; the Padas (words) of the Vedas its ornaments and the six ancillaries were its trinkets.

O sages of good holy rites, the Puranas, Nyaya (science of logic), Mimamsa (treatise on holy rites), the Dharmasastras (ethical literature) were its perfect screen cloths and supports of the tails. It was equipped with all characteristics.

The mantras, syllables, feet and the four stages of life were its bells. Ananta the serpent adorned by his thousand hoods formed its bounding limit.

The quarters and the interstices were the pillars of this chariot: The Puskara and other clouds were its golden banners studded with jewels.

The four oceans formed the blankets spread on its surface: The Ganga and other rivers appeared splendid in female forms, bedecked in all ornaments and holding the chowries in their hands: They occupied different parts in the chariot and rendered it beautiful.

The seven layers of winds, etc. were the seven excellent golden steps. The charioteer was lord Brahma and he held the reins.

Pranava with Brahman for its deity was the whip. The mountain Lokaloka was its landing ground with stairs all round, The splendid Manasa mountain was its external precipice. The other mountains constituted its noses all round [the upper timbers].

The Tala and the residents thereof constituted its pigeon holes, and the pigeons: The mountain Meru was the great umbrella and the Mandara constituted the side drum.

# 23.

The king of mountains (Himavan) was his bow and the bowstring was the lord of serpents (Vasuki) himself, along with Kalaratri (the night of nightmares) and Indradhanus (rainbow).

# 24.

The bell of the bow was goddess Sarasvati of the form of the Srutis (Vedas). Visnu of great splendour was the arrow and Soma (moon) was the spike-head of the arrow.

# 25.

The Kalagni fire at the end of kalpa was the sharp and terrible point of that arrow. The army originated from the waters. The winds were feathers fixed to the arrow.

# 26-27.

After making the divine chariot, bow and arrows with Brahma the lord of the worlds as his charioteer, Siva mounted the divine chariot wearing martial decorations. He was accompanied by the groups of Devas and he shook heaven and earth by his movements.

# 28-31.

Eulogised by the sages and saluted by the bards, the shining splendid lord, the bestower of boons occupied the chariot glancing at the charioteer: The groups of Apsarases, skilled in dancing, danced in his presence (to honour him). When he got into the chariot, evolved out of the different material; the horse originating from the Vedas fell headlong over the earth. The lord Dharanidhara (uplifter of the earth i.e., Visnu), assuming the form of a leading bull lifted up the chariot for a while and tried to stabilise it: But at the next moment even that leading bull slipped down to the earth on his knees.

# 32.

At the instance of the lord Siva, lord Brahma who held the reins in his hands lifted up the horses and steadied the splendid chariot.

# 33.

Then he drove the horses that had the speed of the wind, towards the cities of the swift and courageous Danavas. The cities till then had peace and comfort.

# 34.

Thereafter looking at Devas, lord Rudra said:

# Lingapurana

Give unto me the lordship of Pasus. Then I shall kill the Asuras.

35. O excellent Devas, only after assigning you status of animal souls distinct from that of Devas and others, can they be killed, not otherwise, O excellent ones.

36. After hearing these words of the intelligent lord, all of them became suspicious and uneasy over this change and felt great distress.

37. On realizing their mental reaction, the lord spoke to them thus: O excellent Devas, let there be no fear or misgiving in you in regard to your becoming Pasus.

38-41. Now listen and try to pursue the means of liberation from the state of Pasu. He who performs the divine holy rite "Pasupata" will be liberated from the state of Pasu. O pure ones, I solemnly promise this to you. O excellent Devas, there is no doubt in this that those others too who perform the Pasupata rite will be liberated from the state of a Pasu. He who renders service steadily for twelve years or even half that period or even three years can be liberated from that state. Hence, O excellent Devas, perform this great and divine rite.

42-50. "So be it," said Devas to Siva, who is bowed to by all the worlds. That is why Devas, Asuras and human beings are called Pasus. Rudra is the lord of Pasus and the liberator of Pasus from their bondage: He who is Pasu, shall eschew that state through this holy rite. The scriptures declare that even by committing sins he does not become a sinner.

628. paSinim idhipatyam--lordship of the individual souls (jivas); Cf. "bravid varam vrna ahamcva pasunim adhipatir asini" ~ cited in ST.

629. Siva is named Pasupati, the lord of animals. According to the legend, recorded in the present chapter, every deity was asked by Siva to declare himself a mere Pasu or animal before Tripuras could be slain in the battle: The Gods accepted the proposal, declared themselves as animals and fought brutally. Lord Siva won them the battle but Gods were still distressed. The lord then enjoined the observance of Pasupata vrata for the attainment of their release from animal nature.

This legend forms the basis for the formulation of Pasupata sect which aims at the release of Pasu (the individual soul) from the bondage of rebirth.

Then Vinayaka himself, the boy with the exploit of an adult, forbade Devas as he had not been duly worshipped by Devas and said thus:

Svi Vindyaka said:

Which man, may he be a Deva or Danava, attains perfection in this world without worshipping me by means of splendid foodstuffs, edibles, etc. Hence, O leading Devas, I will cause impediments in a trice in your tasks. O leading Devas, how is it that you had attempted to perform this without worshipping me?

Thereafter all Devas including Indra became frightened. After worshipping that lord and propitiating him with all kinds of edibles and foodstuffs; with loaves and sweet-meats they spoke to lord Ganesa:

"Let now our task be achieved without impediments."

Lord Rudra, the chief of all leading Devas, embraced his son and kissed him on the head. He worshipped and propitiated Ganesa with flowers of sweet fragrance and juicy edibles and foodstuffs.

After worshipping Vinayaka the leader of chieftains, worthy of being worshipped, lord Rudra who had the lord of mountains for his bow started along with the groups of Devas and the chiefs of the Ganas, in order to burn the three cities.

51. The groups of Devas, Siddhas, Bhutas, Ganas and their lords beginning with Nandin followed Isa, Mahesvara, the lord of Devas, with their respective vehicles.

52. Mounted on a chariot as huge as the lord of mountains, Nandin went ahead of Devas and the chiefs of Ganas, in order to strike at the trio of the cities, like the great lord Isa going ahead to strike the god of Death.

53. Mounting on lordly elephants, huge bulls and stately horses, Devas, the lords of Ganas, and the Ganas, with their respective weapons and symbols in their hands followed their leader Nandin the lord of the birds (i.e. Garuda).

54. Mounting on huge as the lord of mountains the bird-bannered lord Visnu of great prowess hurriedly went ahead, on the left side of Rudra in order to burn the three cities for the welfare of the worlds.

55. All Devas followed that lord of the world; the lord of Devas and Asuras, the incomprehensible deity, with their excellent weapons such as the sharp lances, axes, iron clubs, tridents and swords.

56. In the middle of Devas, lord Visnu whose vehicle was bird and whose complexion was like that of the lotus leaf (petal) shone in the same manner as the thousand-rayed fierce sun when he ascends the peak of Sumeru:

60. Yama, Fire, Kubera, Vayu, Nirrti; Varuna and Isana followed Rudra:

61-64. Virabhadra who was very efficient in battle, followed at the south west side of the chariot: He was mounted on huge bull and surrounded by the beings born of his hairs: He thus served the three-eyed lord of Devas in order to destroy the Asura cities: Mahakala of great splendour who appeared like another Mahadeva, served the chariot on its north-western side. The six-faced deity Karttikeya who resembled the king of mountains, who was born of the fire god, and who was surrounded by the army of Devas; served the chariot along with the Siddhas, Caranas, warriors and elephants

65. After creating impediments unto the leading Asuras and after removing obstacles in the case of Devas, lord Ganesa Vighnesvara went to the camp of Iszana, accompanied by the groups of Vighnas (his followers) -

66-67. At that time, Kali went ahead of Ganesa along with the intoxicated Pisicas and Ganas. She had skulls for her ornaments. She was whirling in her hand a trident that shone like Kalaratri. She was intoxicated by drinking the blood of Asuras which tasted like wine (unto her). She made the leading Asuras tremble. She had the gait of the elephant in rut. Her eyes were tremulous due to inebriation. Her body was covered with the hide of the elephant.

68. Saying "Be victorious," the chiefs of the Gandharvas, Pisacas, Yaksas, Vidyadharas, lordly serpents, and leading Devas bowed to the goddess, the daughter of the mountain of snow, and eulogised her loudly.

69. The mothers (Brahmi, Mahesvari, etc.) who were respectfully adored by the groups of Devas and who were bent on killing the Raksasas went to the great Mother (Amba, Gauri) on their vehicles, along with their followers who held banners all around:

70. Riding on a lion, the goddess Durga went forth to chastise Daityas. The auspicious deity was one whose orders could not be transgressed. In her mighty arms, she held weapons of different kinds such as the trident, axe, goad, noose, discus, sword, and conch. She burned and scorched the pathway with her eyes as dazzling as thousands of midday suns and fires. Though a woman, her exploits were uncommon among women.

71. The leading chiefs of the Ganas who shone like the lord of Devas and the sun followed lord Isa on elephants, horses, lions, chariots, and bulls in order to destroy the three cities.

85. The thirty-three, the three hundred and three and three thousand and three Devas went forth on all sides.

92. His white umbrella interspersed with the rays of jewels shone like the full disc of the moon at the time of its rising.

93. The gem-set necklace round the neck of Siva suspended along with his silken upper cloth near the extremity of the umbrella shone like the excellent river Ganga falling from the sky.

94. Then the lord whose lotus-like feet were bowed to by Indra, Brahma, fire-god and others, went to the three cities along with Amba for the welfare of the world.

95. The trident-bearing lord is competent to turn mentally, within a trice; the entire universe including the mobile and immobile beings: Why should then the Pinaka-bearing lord go there himself along with the Ganas in order to burn the three cities?

96. Devas, Vishnu, Brahma and Indra said: 'Of what avail is the chariot to Sambhu? Of what avail is the excellent arrow to him? What has he to do with the groups of Devas? He is never wanting in power to burn the three cities. Then what is this?

97. We think that just for his pastime the Pinaka-bearing lord set about doing all these things: Otherwise, what other benefit has he to derive from this elaborate show?

98. Delighted in the company of leading Devas and Ganas headed by lord Nandin, and with the universe for his chariot he shone along with the goddess, like the mountain Meru with its eight peaks. He shone thus as he neared the three cities.

99. On seeing Isvara, the lord of Devas seated in the arena of the three cities along with Ganas and the daughter of Himavat, the group of Devas followed him.

100. O leading sages, the three cities appeared like another set of the three worlds (because it was occupied) by leading men, the Ganas, Devas and the three kinds of Asuras.

arrow, joined it with the miraculous missile pertaining to Pasupati and thought of the three cities:

102. When the great lord stood ready with the bow well-drawn, the three cities merged into one:

103. When the three cities had attained fusion into one, the delight of the noble-souled deities was tumultuous and excited.

104. Cologising the deity with eight cosmic bodies, all the groups of Devas, Siddhas and sages shouted the words, "Be victorious" auspicious Pusyayoga.

105. Even when the victory was attained, the lord, the husband of Uma, who had destroyed the eye of Bhaga indulged in sportive pastime: Then lord Brahma spoke to him;

106. O Mahadeva, Paramesvara, this gesture on your part is but proper, since, O lord, Asuras and Devas are equal to you.

107. Still, in view of the fact that Devas are virtuous and Asuras are sinful, it behoves you, O lord of the universe, to eschew your sportive pastime:

108. O Isa, O lord, of what avail is the chariot; or the banner or the arrow, or Visnu, or I or even these goblins unto you for burning the three cities?

109-143. It behoves you to burn the trio of the cities even as the Pusya conjunction still prevails: O lord of Devas, it behoves you to burn the three cities quickly lest they should get separated: Then the great lord Virupaksa glanced at the three cities. Instantaneously they were reduced to ashes. All those deities, viz, Soma (Moon), lord Venu, Kalagni (Black fire) and Vayu who were stationed in the arrow bowed down to the lord and said: "O lord of Devas, although the trio of the cities has been burned by your glance it behoves you to discharge the arrow for our welfare." Thereupon O leading brahmins, Isvara, Tripurardana, laughingly brushed the string of the bow, pulled it as far as his ear and discharged the arrow. After burning the three cities.

Three cities that contained hundreds of crores of Daityas, on being burned by that arrow, shone like the three worlds burned by Rudra at the end of the kalpa. Those Daityas who had been worshipping Rudra even at that stage along with their kinsmen, attained the chieftainship of the Ganas, thanks to the power of the duly performed worship. Devas including Rudra and Visnu and the lords of Ganas, looked at the lord and the goddess, the daughter of the Himavat with awe and fear. They did not say anything: On seeing Devas thus frightened, the leading Deva, i.e., Rudra asked them, "What next?" But they merely bowed to him from all sides. They saluted Nandin who had the moon for his ornament. They saluted the daughter of the king of mountains. They saluted the son of the daughter of the mountain, viz Ganesa. They saluted Mahesvara. With due attention, Brahma culogiscd lord Bhava, Isvara the enemy of Tripuras, along with Devas and Visnu.

Brahma said:

1. Be pleased, O lord of the chiefs of Devas; be pleased, Paramcsvara; be pleased, O lord of the worlds; be pleased, eternal lord, the bestower of bliss.

Sita said:

170. Thereupon, after bowing to the lord of Devas, the lotus-born deity became delighted in his mind and spoke with palms joined in reverence:

Brahma said:

171. O lord Sankara, O lord of the chiefs of Devas; O destroyer of Tripuras, O Paramesvara, be pleased to confer on me the greatest devotion towards you.

172. O lord, the bestower of all riches on all Devas: Be pleased with our devotion towards you always as well as with my charioteership.

173. Lord Visnu also bowed down to Mahesvara: Joining his palms together in reverence he said thus to the three-eyed lord accompanied by Uma.

174-175. So lord, be pleased with me; O lord obeisance be to you. I perpetually desire to be your vehicle: I wish for your devotion as well as my efficiency to bear you: O Sankara, the bestower of boons, I wish for omniscience and all-pervasiveness.

Siva said:

176. On hearing their submission Paramesvara, Mahadeva, Bhava engaged them respectively in charioteership and the position of vehicle:

177. After burning Daityas, and after giving boons to Brahma and Visnu, Siva, the noble-souled lord of Devas, vanished along with the goddess; Bhutas and Nandin.

When the lord had gone away from the battlefield along with his Ganas, the awe-struck lords of Devas bowed down to Bhava and Parvati. They became devoid of misery and returned to heaven on their vehicles. The lords of Devas, the chiefs of sages, the lords of Ganas and Bhaskaras went to heaven.

O brahmins, he who reads this chapter on the exploits of the destroyer of Tripuras; originally composed by Brahma formerly or he who narrates this devotedly to the brahmins at the time of Sraddha or during the rites of Devas goes to the world of Brahma. O excellent brahmins, the individual soul is liberated from all kinds of sins mental; physical or verbal. He is liberated from the principal as well as subsidiary sins, gross, subtle or subtlest on hearing this splendid chapter: His enemies will perish and he will be victorious in battle: He will never be harassed by any sickness. Adversities will not afflict him. He shall attain wealth; longevity, renown, learning and incomparable prowess.

# CHAPTER SEVENTYTHREE

# Glory of worshipping Siva

When lord Mahesvara departed thence after burning the three cities in a trice, the lotus-born deity (Brahma) spoke thus in the assembly of the leading Devas.

Brahma said:

Due to the Maya of Lord Visnu the following Daityas forsook Mahadeva and perished along with their cities and citizens. They were the grandson of Tara of great brilliance; the powerful son of Taraka, the asura Tarakaksa, the powerful Kamalakga, Vidyunmalin, the lord of Daityas and many others along with kith and kin. They left the worship of the lord Mahesvara and so they perished: Hence Sadisiva in the Linga form should always be worshipped since Devas have stability.

Glory of Worshipping Siva
only as long as they worship the lord Siva should always be adored by the leading Devas with faith: The entire world is based on the Linga. Everything is founded in the Linga.

# 7-9.

Hence; he who wishes for perfection of the soul shall worship the Linga. It is only through the worship of the Linga that Devas, Daityas, Danavas, Yaksas, Vidyadharas, Siddhas, Pisitasanas, Pitrs, Sages, Pisacas, Kinnaras and others have undoubtedly achieved Siddhi. Hence; O Devas, by any means whatsoever one should always worship the Linga.

# 10-21. The holy rite Pasupata.

We are all Pasus of that intelligent lord of Devas. Eschewing Pasutva and adopting the holy rite Pasupata, the eternal Mahadeva in the Linga form should be worshipped. The five elements should be cleansed simultaneously by means of five Pranavas along with five Pranayamas (control of breath), O leading Devas: Then the process should be repeated with four Pranavas; then with three; and then with two, always accompanied with an equal number of Pranayamas. He shall then utter Omkara and control the Prana and Apana: He shall fill all the limbs with the nectar of perfect knowledge as well as Pranava. He shall then purify the three Gunas, the fourth called Ahankara (ego) and the tanmatras; O Devas of good holy rites. Then he shall cleanse the elements, the organs of sense and the organs of action. After cleansing the two, viz, the Purusa and the Cidatman he shall repeat Agnih Bhasma (the fire is the Ash) and touch the body. He shall then say similarly that the wind, ether, water and earth are ashes and then smear his body with ashes during the three sandhyas throughout life: (By doing so) one becomes Yogin conversant with all tattvas (principles). This is the Pasupata vrata pertaining to Siva. O excellent Devas, it was for the liberation from bondage that this has been mentioned by the lord himself. By performing the Pasupata rite in this manner and by worshipping the great lord in the Linga formerly seen.

by me and the noble-souled Vienu, O Devas, people cease to be Pasus within a year. All rites should be performed assiduously by us after worshipping lord Isvara externally and internally. O excellent Devas, this is my divine vow as well as that of Visnu:

22-25. There is no doubt that it is the vow of the sages also. Hence one should worship Siva: If one does not think about the only God Siva, even for a moment; it is loss, it is a great blemish, it is delusion; it is silence. Those who indulge in devotion to him, those who mentally bow down to him, and those who attempt to remember Bhava are never subjected to misery. The fruit of the worship of Siva is as follows: Pleasant and charming abodes, divine ornaments, women, and riches till one is satisfied: May those who wish for enjoyment of great pleasures or the kingdom of heaven, worship Mahesvara in the Linga form, at all times:

26-29. Even after striking and destroying all living beings, and after burning this entire universe if one should worship the only God Virupaksha (i.e., Siva), one is never tarnished with sins.

After saying; "My Linga is made of rock, it is bowed to by all Devas;" Brahma worshipped Rudra, the lord of the three worlds at the outset and eulogised the three-eyed lord of Devas with pleasing words. Ever since then, Indra and others too worshipped the lord directly after performing the Pasupata rite and smearing their bodies with ashes.

# CHAPTER SEVENTYFOUR

# Description of Siva Lingas

Snta said bidding of Lord Brahma, Visvakarma made the following Lingas befitting the office of Devas and gave those Lingas to them:

# Description %f Siva Lingos

1. The Linga made of Sapphire was worshipped by Vienu: Indra worshipped that of ruby. The son of Visravas worshipped the Linga made of gold.

2. Visvedcvas worshipped Silver Linga, Vasus the auspicious magnetic Linga, Vayu the Linga made of brass; and Asvins the Earthen Linga.

3. King Varuna worshipped the crystal Linga; the excellent Linga made of copper, and king Soma the excellent Linga made of pearls:

4. Ananta and the other great serpents worshipped the Linga of coral; Daityas and Raksasas the ferrous Linga:

5. Guhyakas worshipped the Linga of three metals, Ganas that made of all metals and O excellent brahmins, Camunda and Mothers worshipped the Linga of Sand.

6. Nairrti worshipped the Linga of wood; Yama that of emerald; Nilarudra and others the pure and splendid Linga made of Bhasman (ashes).

7. Laksmi worshipped the Linga of Lakgmivrksa (Bilva tree) Guha the Linga of cowdung: O leading sages, the sages worshipped the excellent Linga of Kusa grass Puepa.

8. Vamadeva and others worshipped the linga and Manonmani the Linga made of scents: Sarasvati worshipped the Linga made of jewels:

9. Durga worshipped the Linga made of gold along with the pedestal: All the Mantras worshipped Ugra in the form of sacrifice with the splendid Linga made of ghce:

10. The Vedas worshipped the Linga of curds; Pisacas the Linga of lead. All the worshippers attained the suitable region by the favour of Brahma.

11. Of what avail is much talk? There is no doubt in this that it was due to their worshipping the Linga that the universe of mobile and immobile beings could stand:

12-15. Due to the difference in the material, say, there are Six types of Lingas. Their subdivisions are forty-four in number. The first type of Linga is called Sailaja (made of rock). It has four sub-divisions. O excellent sages, the second type is made of jewels. It has seven sub-divisions. The third type originates from metals and it has eight sub-divisions. The fourth Linga originates from wood and it is of sixteen sub-

Lingopurana

0 excellent brahmins, the fifth type of Linga is made of clay; it has two subdivisions. The sixth type of Linga is the Keanika (momentary) and it is of seven subdivisions:

The Linga originating from jewels bestows fortune; that originating from rock yields all Siddhis. The Linga made of metals bestows wealth and the Linga made of wood yields the achievement of worldly pleasures.

0 leading brahmins, the Linga of clay is splendid and brings about all Siddhis. The Linga of rock is very excellent; the Linga of metals is the middling one:

Lingas are of numerous types. In brief, they are of nine types. Of the Linga, Brahma is stationed at the root. Vishnu, the lord of three worlds, is stationed in the middle. Above is stationed Rudra, Mahadeva, Sadashiva who is called Pranava. The pedestal of Linga is the great goddess having three Gunas, the mother having three attributes.

The goddess as well as the lord is adored by the person who worships with that pedestal. The splendid Linga whether of rock, or of jewel or of metals, or of wood or of clay or of momentary type, should be installed with devotion. The result is very splendid:

The person who worships the Linga is eulogised by Indra, Brahma, Agni; Yama, Varuna, Kubera, Siddhas, Vidyadharas, the king of serpents, Yaksas, Danavas and Kinnaras with the sounds of the divine drum. He is a meritorious soul: Shining brilliantly with splendour he gradually occupies and passes through Bhuh, Bhuvah, Svah and Mahar worlds and then beyond Janaloka he shall go on to Tapas and Satya; illuminating them with his own brilliance: He shall unhesitatingly pierce the cosmic Egg by means of the large sword deposited in the holy path wherein the Lingas had been installed: After eschewing the Lingas of rock, or of jewels, clay or of metals, or of wood or of the momentary type he shall establish his entire body in the Linga.

The man who installs the splendid Linga white as the kunda trimayl_brohma-vigpu-rudramaya ST, of the form of Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra.

O leading brahmins, his merit cannot be mentioned by me even in hundreds of yugas. Hence one should install the Linga in the above manner.

The Sakala (one with attributes) and divinely splendid body of the lord is worthy of being conceived by all men: But the Niskala (attributeless) body of the lord can be conceived only by the yogin.

# CHAPTER SEVENTYFIVE

# Monism of Siva

The sages said:

1. How did the lord who is niskala (attributeless), nirguna (pure), and nitya (eternal) adopt sakalatva (the state of being with attributes). It behoves you to tell us about this in the same manner you had learnt it formerly.
2. O leading brahmins, persons who know reality recognize the lord in the form of the Pranava, Vijñana (perfect knowledge) after hearing about the unborn lord in the Vedantic treatises.
3. The knowledge that has sound, etc. for its object is called Jnana. Others say that jnana is devoid of error: Still others say that it is not so.
4. O brahmins, some sages say that knowledge which is pure, devoid of impurities, has no alternatives as objects and does not require support and is made manifest through teacher, is the real one.
5. Salvation results only from perfect knowledge. Grace of the lord is conducive to the achievement of perfect knowledge.

Both kelp to liberate the yogin and make him blissful.

6. Some sages say that His contact can be acquired by means of holy rites. By one's own free will, the form that is conceived fancifully shall be withdrawn:

7-1. The heaven is the head of Lord, the sky is his umbilicus, the moon, sun and fire are his eyes, the quarters are his ears. The nether worlds constitute his feet, the ocean is his cloth; Devas are his arms, the constellations are his ornaments, Prakrti is his wife, Purusa is his Linga. From his face issued forth all the Brahmins, Brahma, Indra, and Visnu: The Ksatriyas issued from his arms. The Vaisyas issued from his thighs and Sudras from his feet: Puskara Avartaka and other clouds are his hairs. The winds are born of his nose: The Sruti and Smrti texts constitute his gait.

12. The lord in the form of Karman makes Prakrti function by means of this cosmic body: The glorious Purusa is comprehensible to man through perfect knowledge, not otherwise.

13-14. Tapoyajia (sacrifice in the form of austerity) is superior to thousands of Karmayajnas (sacrifice in the form of holy rites). Japayajia (sacrifice in the form of Japa) is superior to thousands of Tapoyajias. Dhyanayajia (sacrifice in the form of meditation) is superior to thousands of Japayajias. There is nothing greater than Dhyanayajia. Dhyana (meditation) is a means of perfect knowledge:

15. When the yogin stands firmly by equal elegance and sees through meditation, when he is engaged in the Dhyanayajia, Siva becomes manifest in him:

16. All people conversant with the knowledge of Brahman are pure; thanks to that Vidya. There is no expiatory rite or any injunction in regard to Vijnanins (knowers); nor do they have purificatory rites.

17. On consideration it is clear that there is no holy rite in regard to the real knowledge and divine grace the yogin can attain the Supreme bliss. Cf: "Anandamayo'bhyasat" cited in ST. khem - the world of mortals. ST. quotes Visva in support of this meaning.

660. Anandamayah i.e: by the real knowledge and divine grace the yogin can attain the Supreme bliss. Cf: "Anandamayo'bhyasat" cited in ST. khem - the world of mortals. ST. quotes Visva in support of this meaning.

661. The divine origin of society and its division into four classes, viz. Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras, can be traced as far back to the Purana-tika of the Rigveda:

The lord devoid of attributes appears in the hearts of yogins and is identical with the universe: He appears to the wise ones only. The physical body of the great lord is of three types:

31. O excellent brahmins, the first one is Niskala, the second one is Sakala-Niskala and the third one is Sakala:

32-33. Some worship the Sakala-Niskala form, some worship in the heart; or in the Linga or in the fire. Some worship the Sakala form along with their wives and sons:

34-35. Just as Siva so also is the goddess. Just as the goddess so also is Siva. Hence people worship the deities with the consciousness of non-difference. They worship the twenty-seven principles in the body as well as outside, in the mystic diagrams of four, six, ten angles, twelve, sixteen and three sides:

36. Siva, the lord, devoid of difference of Sat and Asat is stationed out of his own free will along with the goddess for the protection of the world.

37. Some call him one, some call him one with two Gunas: Trigunat. Some call him Siva. Others, the knowers of the Vedas speak of him as the cause of the universe:

38. All Brahmins equipped with devotion and auspicious yoga are persons of special characteristics. They are interested in the twenty-seventh category: (Cf. 171. 51). But this classification is only empirical, not real. However, the physical and mental worship of Siva.

In Dharma: In the middle of the hexagon they worship the lord of yogas, having all the forms (or no form).

Those who perceive Siva in the three-sided (mystic diagram), in the middle of the three principles, attain him; not the other yogins: They perceive the three-eyed lord with the three Gunas, the ancient Purusa along with the goddess.

Sata said:

Henceforth, I shall mention the benefit accruing from the installation of the idol entirely, for the welfare of the world. The idol may be in accordance with one's own wish.

After making the idol of the lord seated in an elegant seat along with Skanda and Uma and after installing it with devotion one shall fulfil desires.

In the manner I had heard, I shall mention the benefit that man obtains by worshipping the lord along with Skanda and Uma (even) once (but) in accordance with the injunctions.

Until the dissolution of all living beings, he becomes yogin and sports like Siva in aerial chariots resembling crores of suns wherein everything desirable is available and where virgins of Rudra sing and dance: In the aerial chariots where everything desirable is available he enjoys great pleasures: He then goes to the following worlds one after the other viz the world of Uma; of Kumara, of Isana, of Vienu, of Brahma and of Prajapati: The deity of great splendour passes through the Janaloka and Maharloka: After reaching the world of Indra he assumes the role of Indra for ten thousand years: Again, after enjoying divine and brilliant pleasure in the.

The lord who created twenty-eight crores of Rudras, and then the twenty-fifth principle Puruga, brilliant in all the limbs, from his heart the lord who created Prakrti from his left cosmic intellect from the region of the intellect, the cosmic ego from his own ego and the Tanmatras therefrom. The great lord sportingly created the sense-organs from his own sense-organs. He created the earth from the root of his foot and water from the private parts; He created fire from the umbilical region, the sun from the heart, the moon from his neck, the soul from the middle of his eyebrows and the heaven from the forehead. One shall install the image of the lord who is stationed thus after creating the entire universe inclusive of the mobile and immobile beings:

The man will enjoy great pleasures there for hundred thousand kalpas: He shall be happy and in due course return to his world as master of all sacrifices.

If the devotee makes the idol of the lord who rides on bull accompanied by Uma and with the crescent moon as his ornament, he attains that merit which one usually obtains by performing ten thousand horse-sacrifices. He goes to Siva's divine city in golden aerial chariot having clusters of tinkling bells and he is liberated there itself:

In the manner I have heard, I shall mention the benefit that one attains by making the idol of the lord accompanied by Naudin and Uma and surrounded by all Ganas:

# The Temples of Siva

What avail are the temples he should make for the lord? Still, the devotee of the lord who is saluted by the chief of Devas and the lotus-born deity Brahma makes divine and excellent temples or shrines even with bricks and stones. Even as a childish prank if they make the primordial Siva's image with clay or stone or even with dust and his abode also in the same manner and worship him, they do attain identity with him. Hence, for the achievement of virtue, love, and wealth, the abode of Siva should be made by devotees with devotion, assiduously:

1. By devoutly making the abode of Rudra of the type of Kesar, Nagara, or Dravida one is honoured in the world of Siva.
2. He who makes his mansion called Kailasa, rejoices happily in the aerial chariots of the shapes of Kailasa peaks.
3. Or the devotee shall make in accordance with the injunctions the temple of Mandara for him. He shall devoutly make it in accordance with his means. It may be of the middling or inferior type. Thereby the man goes to the beautiful city of Siva in aerial chariots which resemble the mountain Mandara, and which have faces all round, which are occupied by groups of Apsarases and which are difficult of access even to Devas and Danavas. He enjoys all pleasures, attains the path of knowledge and finally the chieftainship of the Ganas.
4. Even by means of great sacrifices no one attains that benefit which accrues to the person who makes the mansion called Meru: He attains all the benefits of sacrifices, penances, gifts, visits to holy centres, and study of all Vedas. Like Siva, he rejoices for a long time: who makes the mansion.
5. The intelligent devotee like Siva Nigadha with devotion attains Siva's world and rejoices for a long time.
6. O brahmins, he who makes the excellent mansion called Himasaila, goes to the splendid city of Siva by means of vehicles comparable to the mountain Himavat: Attaining the path of knowledge, he shall achieve the chieftainship of the Ganas: man obtains by making the splendid mansion named Niladrisikhare.

He need make it only in accordance with his riches. He shall dedicate it to Rudra with devotion.

18-21. He obtains all those benefits which I have mentioned to you before as the benefit of making the mansion HimaSaila devoutly [see Verse 15]. Then he is bowed to by all Devas. Reaching the world of Rudra he rejoices along with them.

I shall mention the benefit that one attains by making the mansion named Mahendrasaila. He goes to the divine city of Siva in the aerial chariot as huge in size as the mountain Mahendra, yoked to bulls. O leading sages, he enjoys all pleasures and attains perfect knowledge after deliberation with Rudras. He eschews worldly pleasures as though they were poison and attains Sayujya (union) with Siva.

22-23. He who makes a jewel-studded mansion in accordance with the injunctions, of the type of Dravida, Nagara or Kesara or makes the peako; or platform square or oblong in shape attains great merit. His merit cannot be mentioned even in hundreds of yugas.

24-28. If anyone repairs or rebuilds the old, dilapidated, fallen or broken temples and reconstructs them with doors, etc: or if he repairs the mansion, platform, rampart or the ornamental gateway, he derives more benefit than even the original maker. There is no doubt about this. The man who does some job in the temple of Siva though it be for his sustenance undoubtedly goes to the heavenly world along with his kinsmen. If a man does some job in the temple of Rudra even for once and for his own pleasure he attains happiness and rejoices: Hence, O excellent sages, the man who devoutly makes the temple by means of wood, bricks, etc., is honoured in the world of Siva.

29-32. O leading sages, for the grace of Mahesa, for the purpose of achieving virtue, love, wealth and liberation; the mansion of Mahesa should be built assiduously. O excellent sages, if one is incapable of building a mansion he shall serve the lord by means of sweeping and other activities. He who performs the sweeping job with a soft and delicate broom shall attain all desires.

The place within the radius of half a Krosa from the Linga of Siva is called Siva-ksetra (holy centre of Siva). He who casts off his life (within that centre) usually very difficult to be cast off, shall obtain Sayujya with Siva: O sages of good holy rites, measuring units of the self-born these are the Bana Linga. In the Svayambhuva, O excellent brahmins, the measure of the holy centre shall be half; in the Arsa (pertaining to the sages) it shall be half of that: In the Manusa (pertaining to human beings) it shall be still half of that: O excellent brahmins, the measure of holy centres in the abode of ascetics is thus.

He who casts off his vital breath in any of these places shall attain Sayujya with Siva: viz: Rudrivatara, Naravalara, the holy Sriparvata and its boundary line. The benefit shall be extended to his disciples and the disciples of disciples.

(After sprinkling) with scented cowdung water the devotee shall make the mystic diagram of the auspicious lotus along with the pericarp. For this purpose, the dust particles of pearls, sapphires, rubies, crystals, emerald, gold or silver may be used: Those who are not sufficiently rich may use other powders similar in colour to the powders mentioned above. The mystic diagram shall extend up to ten Hastas. It should be described near Mahadeva. Mahadeva accompanied by the nine Saktis shall be invoked therein. The devotee shall invoke the lord who bestows the desired things by means of five elements, six sense-organs and eight cosmic bodies. Again the devotee shall worship Isana in the ten-cornered (mystic diagram) through the eight cosmic bodies or the ten organs of sense and knowledge externally. After the worship, the devotee shall bow down and offer food offerings to the lord of Devas. He shall thereby obtain the benefit of the charitable gift of earth. The indigent person shall make the mystic diagram of the lotus by means of the powdered grains of Sali rice: Even then he shall obtain the merits as mentioned before.

In the middle region, he shall worship the goddess of Devas, Prakrti, in the form of Brahman. To the right, he shall worship the deity of Sattva-Guna; to the left that of Rajo-Guna and in front.

that of Tamo-Guna: He shall worship the goddess Ambika in the middle: To the right he shall worship the five elements and the five Tanmatras: To the north he shall worship the five organs of action and five organs of sense: In the six-sided figure he shall worship the two Atmans, viz, Atman and Antaratman as well as the cosmic intellect and ego along with the principle Mahat. He shall then attain the benefit of all sacrifices.

Leading brahmins, thus the great Prakrta Mandala (the mystic diagram pertaining to Prakrti) has been mentioned to you. Henceforth I shall mention the means of achieving all desired objects.

The devotee conversant with the mantras shall sprinkle the ground duly with water and scrub it with cow-dung: He shall then make the mystic diagram in the form of square measuring 90-carma (i.e: 150 Hastas a side). He shall then decorate it with canopies, or charming umbrellas. He shall embellish them with globe-like bubbles or crescent-shaped trinkets made of gold or the leaves of Asvattha tree. He shall decorate it with full blown white, red or blue lotuses; also strings of pearls shall be suspended from the extremities of the canopies. He shall embellish it with white banners and silken Vaijayantis (Ensigns) or garlands of sprouts and fruits. There shall be white mud-pots and elegant water-jars filled with water. He shall have fifty lamps in a row and five kinds of incense: The devotee shall make an excellent lotus with fifty means of powders of different colours or only with petals by white powder: The lotus shall extend to one Hasta in magnitude. It shall be made in accordance with the injunctions: He shall fix the lord Rudra, the lord of Devas along with the goddess in the pericarp: Beginning with the petal in the east and proceeding gradually he shall fix the syllables in the petals along with the Rudras. O sages of holy rites, the syllables are to begin with the Prapava and end with Namas. O excellent sages, after duly worshipping thus with scents and fragrant flowers; he shall feed fifty brahmins in accordance with the injunctions. He shall give those leading sages the charitable gifts of garlands of rosary, sacred thread, ear-rings, water-pots, etc.

staf, turbans and clothes. He shall offer Mahacaru a8 Naivedya to Sambhu the lord of Devas and dedicate the black (i.e: black cow and a black ox). In the end he shall offer the mystic diagram made of powders to the lord of Devas. He shall then offer materials of utility in a sacrifice to Siva. The intelligent devotee shall perform the Japa of the letters one by one with Omkara in the beginning: I shall briefly mention the benefits that a man attains after describing this excellent Mandala amongst all with devotion:

# 95-98.

By seeing the coloured Mandala and by worshipping it one attains the same benefit as a yogin attains in the following circumstances: When he has learned the Vedas duly along with their Angas (ancillary subjects); when he has worshipped God by means of sacrifices, such as Jyotistoma etc., ending with that of Visvajit; when (as householder) he has procreated sons like himself; when he has adopted the stage of life of forest-dweller with earnestness maintaining the sacrificial fire, and performing all rites such as Candrayana, etc.; when he has renounced all holy rites, learned Brahmavidya assiduously and attained perfect knowledge; and when with perfect knowledge he has seen what should be seen.

# 99-100.

After scrubbing and cleaning the front yard of the shrine by any material, O excellent brahmins, if a devotee describes a mystic diagram in the form of a square to the north or south or to the west of the shrine and embellishes it with the powders, flowers, raw rice grains, etc., and then worships the deity with flowers, raw rice grains, etc., he is liberated from all sins.

# 101-102.

He, who devoutly scrubs and cleans the sanctum sanctorum all round, even once, scatters scented flowers all round, offers fragrant articles like sandal paste, camphor, etc., makes the place sweet-smelling with incense of four kinds and prays to the lord Isana, goes to the world of Siva.

# 103-104.

The man enjoys pleasures for hundred crores of kalpes: His body emits sweet fragrance like that of flowers with which he fills the temple of Siva. Gradually he goes to the world of Gandharvas and is worshipped by the Gandharvas: He comes to this world in due course and becomes a powerful monarch.

105-106. Mahadeva is the primordial lord. He is the cause of creation, dissolution and sustenance: Sadasiva is pervasive and is the overlord of the worlds. The nectar of Siva-Brahman should be known as the excellent means of salvation: One shall always worship the lord; the manifest and the unmanifest being the lord beyond imagination.

# CHAPTER SEVENTYEICIT

# Scrubbing and cleaning the shrins gf Sive

Spta said:

1. O excellent sages, the holy shrine of Siva should be scrubbed and cleaned by means of water filtered and purified with cloth. Otherwise no Siddhi is attained.
2. O leading sages, waters that have no foam, particularly from the rivers, should be taken: When filtered with a cloth they become pure and holy.
3. Hence, O excellent brahmins, all divine holy rites should be performed by the used waters for achieving the results in purifying rites.
4. Waters are mixed with minute germs. By using the unfiltered waters one attains the same sin as by killing them.
5. O brahmins, householders adopt violent means always while sweeping or wiping, while using fire, threshing, pounding things or while fetching water. But one shall eschew violence: Non-violence is the greatest virtue to all living creatures.
6. Hence, by all means one shall practice water purified by cloth: The meritorious and charitable gift of giving protection is the excellent of all charitable gifts.
7. Hence, violence should be avoided always and at all places: All violent creatures do not harm man who abstains from violence mentally, verbally and physically. They harass one who injures others. A man who abstains from violence obtains crore times the benefit that one attains by gifting away the three worlds to one who has mastered the Vedas. Those who are engaged in the welfare of living beings...

tally, verbally and physically and those who follow the path pointed out by kindness go to the world of Rudra.

# I-15a.

Those who protect persons of various sorts like a loving master or with love as if they were their own sons and grandsons, go to the world of Rudra. Hence; by all means, sprinkling should be performed by means of water filtered with cloth: The ablution should be carried out particularly. Even by killing a single person in the premises of Siva's temple one attains the sins that accrue from destroying the three worlds: But, O excellent brahmins, violence to flowers must always be pursued for the worship of Siva, violence to the animals for the sake of sacrifice: The chastisement of the wicked by the Ksatriya caste can be pursued,

# 15b-17a.

In the case of yogins expounding the Brahman these rules regarding what is laid down and what is forbidden are not applicable: They shall not be killed even if they resort to forbidden things. Similarly expounders of Brahman shall not be killed since they have eschewed all actions and taken to Sannyasa, even if at times they are prone to sinful activities:

# 17b-18.

Women are holy ones as they are born of the family of Atri. Even when they are engaged in sinful acts they should not be killed. They are to be worshipped always. By killing Atreyis one incurs a sin equal to the slaughter of a brahmin.

# 19-20.

Women from any caste should not be taken up for the Yajnas at any time; by anyone or in any place, O leading brahmins. Women engaged in sinful activities, whether they be dirty or beautiful, ugly or robed in ugly clothes should never be killed by men due to the suspicion that they may be Siva.

# 21.

Those who practice the holy rites and conduct of life outside the pale of the Vedas, those who are excluded from the rites laid down in Srutis and Smrtis and those who are notorious as heretics should not be conversed with by the twice-born:

violence incurred by plucking flowers (puspa-hirnea) for Siva worship is painful, also the slaughter of animals in propitiation of Siva. V-19 (below) prohibits the slaughter of women in sacrifice implying thereby that man-slaughter (nara-vali) was a common practice: ST interprets 'quriyah' 0 'manura-striyah' and explains that the restriction of slaughter did not apply to the female animals: ST quotes scriptural laying (rut) in support of this view.

The mode of worship of Siva

22. They should neither be seen nor touched. After seeing them one should look at the sun. Still they should not be killed by kings or other creatures:

23. O brahmins, by worshipping lord Siva even for once, thanks to the contact with good men; man attains Rudra's world.

24. Excellent sages, all unkind persons become miserable: So also, all men who are devoid of devotion towards the great lord.

25. Those who are devotees of Siva, the lord of Devas, are fortunate: After enjoying pleasures here itself they become liberated.

26. The minds of men are attached towards sons, wives and houses just as the minds of ascetics and sages are attached towards the primordial lord: But if men turn their minds towards the lord at least once by chance the world of great Isa is not far for them.

# CHAPTER SEVENTY-NINE

# The mode of worship of Siva

The sages said:

1-2. O sages of great intellect; how should the great lord, the lord of subjects be worshipped by tardy and dull-witted men who are short-lived, whose strength is trifling and whose virility is insignificant: Even after worshipping lord Siva by means of penance for thousands of years, Devas do not see him: How then do they worship the lord?

Sita said:

3. O leading sages, what you have said is quite true. Still with faith the lord can be seen and pleased and even conversed with: O brahmins, if those who are devoid of devotion even incidentally worship the lord, he bestows fruits befitting the emotion:

5. The base brahmin who worships the lord after being defiled by the leavings of food becomes a Pisaca. The man of deluded intellect who worships the lord in a fit of anger shall attain the abode of Raksasas.

6. The wicked man who eats forbidden food and worships the lord becomes a Yaksa. A man who practises music and worships the lord attains the abode of Gandharvas. A person who practises dance also attains the same state.

7. The base man attached to women and yearning for fame attains the abode of the moon (by worshipping the lord). A person afflicted by pride and arrogance, worshipping Rudra, shall attain the abode of Soma (moon?).

8. By worshipping the lord by means of Gayatri verses, one shall attain the world of Prajapati. By worshipping by means of Pranava, one attains the abode of Brahma or Visnu.

9. By worshipping the lord with faith even for once, the devotee attains the world of Rudra and rejoices along with the Rudras. The splendid Linge, worshipped by Devas and Asuras, should be cleaned by the holy waters. The lord should be invoked devoutly in the pedestal.

10-22. After visiting the lord duly and after worshipping him, he should be installed in the conceived seat which has the splendid form of perfect knowledge, which is richly endowed with detachment and prosperity, which is bowed to by all the people, which is in the middle of the lotus of Omkara and which has its origin from the moon, sun, and fire. After offering Padya, Acamana, and Arghya to Rudra, the devotee shall bathe the deity with pure waters, ghee, and milk. He shall bathe Rudra with curds and clean Him. Thereafter he shall bathe the deity with pure water and worship it with sandal-paste. After worshipping with yellow pigment, he shall worship it with red flowers, unbroken Bilva leaves, blue and red lotuses, Nandyavarta flowers, Mallikis, Campakas, Jati flowers, Bakulas, Karaviras, Sami and Brhat flowers, Unmattas, Agastyas, bunches of Apimarge flowers, and splendid ornaments. After offering incense of five kinds, he shall offer milk pudding as Naivedya. Other food offerings shall be rice with curds, rice soaked in honey and ghee, then pure cooked rice.

After eulogising lord Itana and after worshipping Siva he shall adore him by repeating the mantras of Isana, Tatpurusa, Aghora, Vamadeva and Sadyo-jata. With this mode of worship lord Mahesvara becomes delighted. Excellent brahmins, those trees which are utilised in the worship of Siva through their flowers leaves, etc., and the cows too, attain the supreme goal:

# 25.

There is no doubt in this that a man attains Brahma world by seeing Mahadeva who has been worshipped or is being worshipped. Hearing about the lord approves of it and rejoices therein attains the greatest goal.

# 26-30.

He who on once; offers a ghee lamp in front of the Linga attains that by means of the stages in life goal which is difficult of access and which is steady. By offering a tree of lamps either made of clay or of wood in the temple of Siva one is honoured in the world of Siva along with hundred members of his family: He who duly and devoutly offers lamps to Siva made of iron, copper, silver or gold shall go to the city of Siva in splendid vehicles refulgent like ten thousand suns.

He who offers a ghee lamp in front of Siva in the month of Karttika or he who sees the great lord being duly worshipped with faith, O excellent sages, goes to the world of Brahma: It is mentioned that the rites of invocation, Welcome presence; installation and worship shall be conducted through Rudra Gayatri, the Asana (seat) by means of Pranava, the ablution by means of five mantras (Sadyojata etc.):

One shall thus perpetually worship Uma's husband, the lord of Devas: One shall worship Brahma with Pranava on his right side:

35-37. To his north; he shall worship Visnu the lord of the chiefs of Devas by means of Gayatri, after performing Homa in the fire duly by repeating the five mantras and the Pranava. By thus worshipping the lord he attains Sayujya with Siva. Thus, succinctly the mode of worshipping Siva has been mentioned: After hearing this directly from Rudra, this was mentioned to me by Vyasa in former times.

# The holy PaSupata rite

The sages said

1. How is the liberation of the Pasu (Individual soul) from the Pasa (bondage) effected on seeing Pasupati? It behoves you to tell us how Devas eschewed their Pasutva?

Suta said

2-5. Thanks to the grace of omniscient lord, formerly Devas came to him as he had stationed in his city called Bhogya on the peak of the Kailasa, for the welfare of Devas. Lord Visnu, mounted on the wings of Garuda, came along with Brahma. He approached the lord of Devas along with Devas. Along with Yama, Indra and the Sadhyas, they came to the splendid and excellent mountain and bowed down to the excellent mountain as well as to the lord. The Garuda-bannered lord Visnu got down from Garuda and climbed the Meru along with the foremost Devas:

6-7. Meru was devoid of all sins: It bestowed each and every object of desire: It was the chief means of enjoyment: The flocks of sparrows rejoiced therein. Herds of elephants.

702. Bhogya or Bhogya. The city is located on the mountain Kailasa.

The holy Pifupata rite
made it resonant: There was sweetrattling music. Even the darkness was welcome to people: The region of the forest was well laid with footsteps: The waters at the borderland were sparkling and the wind was attractive. It consisted of hundreds and thousands of abodes resembling suns. It was blended with the flocks of swans adept in elegant movements: It contained trees, such as Dhava, Khadira; Palasa, sandal, etc: and groups and flocks of excellent birds, such as the cuckoo etc. and also the bees.

8. In some places it abounded in divine trees. There were Kurabaka, Priyaka and Tilaka trees. The excellent mountain had many Kadamba trees and was surrounded by the creepers of Tamala. The mountain had many Peaks.

9. The city of lord Siva was built by Visvakarman on the top of this mountain for the sports of lord Siva.

10. Devas including Indra and Visnu saw that city and with great concentration and attention they bowed down from a great distance due to the power of the trident-bearing lord:

11. The great primordial lord went to the mountain Kailasa, part of the Meru, which is as refulgent as thousand suns, and which is great and which has thousands of virtues blended with it:

12. Then Brahma and Visnu the destroyer of Asuras reached the gateway of the city which resembled the lofty mountain and which abounded in women; horses, elephants, chariots; Ganas and their chiefs.

13. It was surrounded by big mansions full of gold and bedecked in jewels. It contained lofty palaces of various shapes and also ramparts of the city of Siva.

14-20. On seeing the exterior of the city of lord along with Devas including Brahma, Visnu with beaming face became delighted in his mind. He then entered the city which had great palaces and mansions with lofty upper storeys: The second city of the lord of Devas was also splendid. It had four entrances. It was encompassed by diamonds, lapis lazuli, rubies and clusters of jewels and hanging swings: It was bedecked with bells and chowrics, and resonant with musical instruments, such as Mrdanga, Muraja, Vina and Venu: It was surrounded by dancing Apsarases and Bhutas (goblins). There were mansions.

Lingapurane

Charming to the eyes, they resembled the abodes of the leaders of Devas. On the tops of these palaces, thousands of lady citizens stood with flowers, fruits, and Aksatas (raw rice grains) in their hands. As on the head of Lord Siva, they strewed these on the head of Visnu from all directions. On seeing Visnu, the women rejoiced immediately, danced, and sang. Their eyes were roving due to inebriation, and they had ample buttocks. On seeing Visnu, some women wore smiling faces; their garments became loosened, their waistbands and girdles dropped. They sang passionate songs.

21-35 Visnu then went beyond those excellent cities (one within the other) the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth. Then he reached the highly splendid city of Siva. It was perfectly circular and very splendid, stationed on the auspicious peak of Kailasa. It was adorned with lofty mansions resembling the sphere of the sun. In different quarters, it contained crystal Mandapas and splendid platforms made of gold and different jewels. The ornamental gateways were adorned with different kinds of jewellery and many jewel-studded Sarvatobhadras (temples with openings on all four sides). There were twenty-eight fort walls of different forms and shapes. There were side doors and main doors in the interstices of the quarters; all firmly built and of diverse kinds. There were hidden apartments and houses. There were splendid abodes of Guha: O highly blessed ones, they were built in the rural model and other types. There were charming pearls too. The divine abodes of the leaders of Ganas were full of rubies. There were many splendid flower gardens of various shapes with sandal trees in them. There were many lakes and tanks with golden rows of steps. They were frequented by swans that had been defeated by the gaits of women. The tanks had divine and nectarine water, and the water fowls (Karandas) - peacocks, cuckoos, and ruddy geese heightened their splendour. There were thousands of Rudrakanyas (virgins) who were bedecked in all ornaments, who were adepts in conversation and elocution, who stooped down due to the weight of their heavy breasts, whose eyes were roving due to inebriation, and who were engaged in singing and playing on instruments.

blown lotuses difficult of access even to Devas. There were excellent birds of all kinds. There were the womenfolk of Rudras lustrous as rubies, engaged in aquatic sports. There were groups of women engaged in amorous festivals of great elegance: They were passionately fond of rural notes and strains of music. On seeing these things in the abode of lord Siva the great lord of Devas stood in surprise:

36. There itself they saw Rudraganas and thousands of their heroic leaders.

37. They saw the crystalline aerial chariots, lofty palaces bedecked in diamonds, lapis lazuli and golden steps.

38-41. On the tops of palaces there were delighted women with lotus-like eyes, and ample buttocks. There were Yaksas, Gandharvas and Apsarases, Kinnaris, Kinnaras, serpents, and siddha girls. They had different kinds of dresses: They were bedecked in different ornaments: They had diverse efficiency. They were fond of pleasure and amorous dalliance: They had the lustre of the blue lotus petals. They had eyes as large as the petals of lotus. They looked resplendent by their upper garments resembling the filaments of lotus: They were bedecked in bangles, anklets, necklaces and umbrellas of variegated colours as well as attractive garments. They were fond of embellishments and they were bedecked in various ornaments also.

42. On seeing these beautiful women of the chiefs of Ganas, the leading Devas—Indra and others went to the mansion of the destroyer of Tripuras:

43. On seeing the first palace of the lord, that had the colour of a thousand rising suns, in the middle of the city, the groups of Devas and Siddhas beginning with Indra halted there.

44. Then all Devas with Indra at their head saw Nandin, the lord of Ganas standing at the doorway of the palace:

45. On seeing Nandin the leader of Ganas, Devas bowed down to him and said Be Victorious. On seeing them the leader of Ganas replied:

46. So highly blessed Devas, why have you come here? O persons of good holy rites, you who have shaken off your sins; ye the lord of all worlds; it behoves you to say:

47. They then spoke to the lord, the bestower of boons, the lord having the lustre of a lordly elephant. For our liberation from the bondage of Pasus kindly show lord Mahesvara to us.

48. Formerly in order to burn the three cities, the Pasutva was stipulated. O you of good holy rites, now we are worried over this Pasutva.

49. The holy rite Pasupata was mentioned by lord Siva. O leader of Bhutas, thanks to this holy rite, the state of Pasu ceases to exist.

50-53. By performing this excellent Vrata for twelve years, or for twelve months or for twelve days; all Pasus are liberated from the bondage of worldly existence: Nandin, the son of Silada, the leader of the Bhutas showed the lord to all Devas including Visnu. On seeing lord Siva the unchanging deity accompanied by Amba and Ganas, Devas were thrilled with pleasure: They bowed to the lord and eulogised him. After submitting to lord Siva, their desire for liberation from bondage; Devas stood in front of lord Siva bowing again and again.

54-57. After glancing at them and purifying their souls, the full-bannered lord of Devas, the great lord taught the Pasupata Vrata to them. He then seated himself along with Uma and the sages. Since then, all Devas are known as Pasupatas (belonging to Pasupati). All those who consider the lord of Pasus as their direct deity are said to be Pasupatas. Thereafter, Devas performed penance again.

58-60. The excellent Devas performed penance for twelve years and became free from bondage: They went back with Brahma and Visnu: Thus everything that had been heard from Brahma has been mentioned to you: It had been heard by Sanat and by Vyasa from him: The man who remains pure and hears this or narrates this to the brahmins attains different body and is liberated from the bondage of Pasus.

# CHAPTER EIGHTYONE

# The holy rite for the release of Pasus

The sages said:

1. This holy rite that liberates Pasus (individual souls) from bondage has been mentioned by you. This holy rite of Pasupati pertaining to the Linga had been performed formerly by Devas. It behoves you to mention this to us in the manner you had heard it formerly.

Sita said: Formerly, Nandin, the son of Sanatkumara, was earnestly asked by Silada. What Nandin spoke to him I shall mention succinctly. This excellent vrata called Dvadasa Linga and capable of liberating Pasus from bondage had been performed by Devas, Daityas, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Caranas and the highly blessed sages.

5. It yields worldly pleasures, liberation; yogic power and whatever one desires. It is auspicious, holy and conducive to perseverance and energetic efforts. It destroys entanglement in worldly affairs in the case of devotees.

6. It has been evolved after churning the Vedas and their six ancillaries. It excels all charitable gifts and is holier than ten thousand horse-sacrifices.

7. It is sacred, bestows all auspicious things; destroys all enemies, brings about salvation even to those creatures that are immersed in the ocean of worldly existence.

8. It dispels all sickness and destroys all fevers: It had been performed formerly by Devas as well as by Brahma and Visnu.

703. N.S. edition reads saviyoga-karem' for abbiyoga-karam' evi-yogakaram Jarvada fiva-tannidhyedayakam ST that which brings about the devotee's proximity to Siva.

704. Sadanga six ancillaries to the Veda, namely (i) Siksha - the science of proper articulation and pronunciation, (ii) Chandus - the science of prosody, (iii) Vyakarana - grammar; (iv) Nirukta - etymological explanation of difficult Vedic words, (v) Jyotisa - astronomy, (vi) Kalpa - ritual or ceremonial.

May Mahalaksmi the mother of the universe dispel my sin. She is the eldest, most excellent, bestower of boons and bedecked in excellent ornaments.

May the highly blessed Mahamoha (the great delusion), surrounded by the great groups of goblins and engaged in the worship of Siva dispel my sin:

May Laksmi who is endowed with all attributes, who has all the characteristics; who is the goddess that bestows all and who is omnipresent, dispel my sin.

May Durga engaged in the worship of Siva dispel my sin. She is the great goddess riding on a lion. She is the unchanging daughter of Parvati: She is Mahamaya of Visnu constituting his slumber: She is worshipped by Devas.

May all the mental sons of Sati, the Rudras who sustain the Cosmic egg, and who are worshipped by all the worlds, dispel my fear.

May the Bhutas, Pretas, Kugmandas, the leaders of Ganas and of Kusmandas dispel my sin.

Devas eulogised the lord with this hymn and then bowed down their heads as far as the ground. O excellent brahmins, he who reads this divine hymn every month, or he who listens to this, sheds off all sins and is honoured in the world of Rudra:

He who seeks a virgin obtains her; he who is desirous of victory shall attain victory; he who is desirous of wealth shall attain wealth and he who wishes for sons will obtain sons. He who seeks learning obtains learning; he who seeks enjoyment of pleasures will attain pleasures.

By listening to this, man obtains immediately whatever he desires. He will be favourite of Devas. If this meritorious hymn is read on behalf of someone, the ailments arising from gas, bile, etc., do not harass him. He courts no premature death nor is he bitten by snakes: the hymn obtains many.

By repeating this hymn, the merit of visiting holy centres, and giving charitable gifts and performing the vratas in particular: The slayer of cows, the ungrateful wretch, the murderer of heroes, brahmins, mother and father, the slayer of those who seek refuge, the sinner who is guilty of breach of faith towards friends, all these wretched men dispel their sins and are honoured in the world of Siva.

33-34. The "Om" is the single-syllabled Mantra. The all-pervading Siva is stationed in it: The five syllables constitute his body. He is stationed in the six-syllabled subtle Mantra in the form of the 'expressed and the expression.' Siva is Vacya (the expressed) since he is comprehensible: The Mantra is his Vacaka (expression).

35-36. The relation of the expressed and the expression is a primordial one between the two. In the Vedas and in Siva-gamas the main Mantra is the six-syllabled one but for the purpose of secular activities it is the five-syllabled Mantra. Why should he have many Mantras and extensive scriptures?

37. If anyone has retained this Mantra in his heart he has studied the Vedas; he has heard the sacred lore; he has performed everything: performs its japa after learning.

38. If a scholar studies the Vedas in accordance with the injunctions it is enough; the perfect knowledge of Siva is this much; the greatest goal is thus far.

39-41a. Brahmavidya (learning pertaining to the Brahman) is this much: Hence; the learned man shall continuously perform its japa. This Mantra consisting of the Pranava and the five syllables is my heart; it is the greatest esoteric secret greater than all else; it is the excellent knowledge leading to salvation. I shall mention the sage, the metre and the deity controlling this Mantra, its Bija, Sakti, Svara (vowel), Varna (letter), Sthana (place of origin), letter by letter:

41b-43. The sage is Vamadeva; the metre is Pankti. I, Siva alone; am the deity of this Mantra, O lady of excellent face: The syllables "ma" etc. are the Bijas; they are in the form of the five elements; know that the Pranava is the unchanging Atman that is all-pervasive; you alone are its Sakti, O goddess bowed to by all Devas:

758. The five-syllabled mantra of Siva prefixed by om: "Om aamas Sivaya."

44. Something is your Prapava and something is my Pranava. O gentle lady, your Pranava is undoubtedly the Sakti of all the Mantras.

45-46. The letters 'a', 'u' and 'm' are present in my Prapava, the letters U, m and &#x26; constitute in order your Pranava, which has three Matras and the Pluta tone (prolated vowel). The Svara (Note) of Omkara is Udatta (high), the sage is Brahma and the body is white.

47-54. The metre is Daivi Gayatri; it is the presiding deity; the first, second and fourth letters are Udatta (high). The fifth is Svarita (neither high nor low), the middle one is Nisada. The letter n is of yellow colour, its place of origin is the eastern face: Indra is the deity, Gayatri the metre and Gautama the sage. The letter mah is of black colour; its place of origin is the southern face; the metre is Anustup, the sage is Atri, Rudra is the deity. The letter Si is of smoky colour; its place of origin is the western face; the sage is Visvamitra, the metre is Tristup and the deity is Visnu. The letter va is of golden colour, its place of origin is the northern face; Brahma is the deity, Brhati is the metre and Angiras the sage. The letter Ja is of red colour; its place of origin is the upward face; the metre is Virat; the sage is Bharadvaja and Skanda is the Deity.

I shall now mention the Nyasa (fixing rite) that is auspicious and conducive to the achievement of all Siddhis. It is destructive of all sins too. Nyasa is of three types; the difference being due to their connection with creation, sustenance and dissolution.

55-59. These Nyasas belong respectively to the religious students, the householders and ascetics, i.e., the Nyasa of Utpatti (creation) is for the religious student; the Nyasa of Sthiti (sustenance) is for the householders and the Nyasa of Samhrti (dissolution) is for the ascetics; otherwise Siddhi cannot be achieved: The Nyasa is of three types viz, Ariganyasa (the fixation of the limbs); Karanyasa (that of the hand).

# The Story of the Five-Syllabled Mantra

Dehanyasa (that of the body). O lady of splendid face; the Nyasa of the three types relating to creation, etc. is being mentioned to you: One shall at the outset perform the Nyasa of the hand; thereafter he shall perform the Nyasa of the body and thereafter he shall perform the Nyasa of Angas (limbs) in the order of the syllables of the mantra. The fixation beginning with the head and ending with the feet is called the Utpatti-nyasa. O beloved one, that beginning with the feet and ending with the head is the Nyasa of Samhara (dissolution). The Nyasa of the heart, face and throat is Sthitinyasa (that of sustenance).

O splendid lady, these Nyasas relate to the religious students; householders and the ascetics respectively. Repeating the Mantras one shall touch the body along with the bead: That is common to all householders, religious students and ascetics:

Beginning with the thumb of the right hand and ending with the thumb of the left; if the fingers are fixed it is called Utpattinyasa (the Nyasa of creation). Its opposite is that of dissolution: Fixing the Nyasa beginning with the thumb and ending with the little finger in both the hands is called Sthitinyasa (that of sustenance). O gentle lady, it yields much pleasure to the householders: This is the common procedure. The Nyasa of the hand is performed at first, then the Nyasa of the body and thereafter one shall perform the Nyasa of the limbs. Then the devotee shall perform the Nyasa over all the limbs and then one by one with the full Mantra with Onkara prefixed and suffixed on all the ten fingers of the hands. The devotee shall perform the Nyasa rite facing the east or the north after first washing the feet: He shall be clean and attentive:

At the outset he shall remember the sage, metre, deity, Bija, Sakti, Atman and preceptor, O lady of splendid face. Repeating the Mantra, he shall wipe off the hands and fix the Pranava in the palms and in the first and last knots in all the fingers: He shall fix the Bijas along with the Bindus in the five middle knots. In accordance with the order of the

stages of life he shall perform the Nyasa of creation, etc. with both hands and beginning with the foot and ending with the head. Repea the Mantra with Omkara affixed he shall touch the body (1) on the head, face, neck, heart and in the private parts; and, on the two feet; (2) in the private parts and in the heart and in the neck in the middle of the lace and on the head or (3) he shall fix in the heart; in the private parts, on the feet, on the head, in the face, and in the neck he shall fix with the Pranava, etc: in three ways:

73-76. After fixing the limbs thus, the devotee shall meditate upon the faces (of Siva). Beginning with the face in the east and ending with the face upward he shall fix the syllables beginning with na in due order. Thereafter he shall perform the Nyasa rite of the six limbs in the respective places with delight: The Nyasa shall be accompanied with the words Namas (obeisance), Svaha, Vasat Hum, Vausat and Phat: The Pranava is known as the heart; the syllable na the head; the syllable ma the tuft; the syllable va the coat of mail; the syllable ya the eye; the syllable Astra (missile).

After fixing the letters on the limbs as mentioned the devotee shall bind the quarters.

77-78. The deities of the four corners beginning with the south-east, are respectively Vighnesa, the mother Durga and Ksetrajna (?). The devotee shall fix them with the tip of the thumb fixed on that of the index finger with beaming face: After saying "Protect ye all" he shall make obeisance to them severally. The expert devotee shall perform the Nyasa of fingers beginning with the index finger the hand on the thumb. He shall perform the Nyasa on the middle of the neck also. This Nyasa rite is said to be splendid and destructive of sins. It is conducive to the achievement of Siddhis. It is holy, auspicious and affords all protection:

81. When the Nyasa rite has been performed by means of the splendid Mantra the devotee shall be on a par with Siva, Within a moment; all the sins committed in the previous births are destroyed.

82. The intelligent devotee shall be pure in body by performing this Nyasa rite. Steady in the performance of holy rite.

# The Glory of the Five-Syllabled Mantra

He shall repeat the five-syllabled Mantra after acquiring the same gracefully from a preceptor:

0 splendid lady, henceforth, I shall recount the procedure for acquiring the Mantra. Without it the Mantra is futile and with it, it is efficacious. The futile ones are the following:

- Ajmahina (i.e. Mantra acquired without permission)
- Kriyahina (devoid of holy rites)
- Sraddhahina (devoid of faith)
- Amanasa (non-mental i.e. if the devotee does not devote full attention)
- Anajnaptam (that which has been prohibited)
- Daksinaninam (permitted but devoid of gifts)
- Sadajapta (indiscriminately repeated always)

The following Mantras are fruitful:

- Ajnasiddha (achieved with permission)
- Kriyasiddha (attended with rituals)
- Sraddhasiddha (fully equipped with faith)
- Sumanasa (where the mind fully dwells)
- Daksinasiddha (attended with gifts)

The devotee shall approach the brahmin preceptor who is conversant with the real meaning of the Mantra, who has perfect knowledge, who is interested in the path of meditation, and who is endowed with good qualities. With emotional purity, the devotee shall assiduously propitiate him mentally, verbally, physically, and monetarily. The disciple shall always worship the preceptor with all attention. If he is sufficiently affluent, the disciple shall give these things devoutly to the preceptor: elephants, horses, chariots, jewels, fields, houses, ornaments, clothes, and different kinds of grains. If he wishes for his Siddhi, he shall not be stingy in spending money:

0 gentle lady, thereafter he shall dedicate himself along with his possessions and attendants. After worshipping thus in accordance with his capacity and not at all attempting deception, the disciple shall grasp the mantra and perfect knowledge from the preceptor, gradually:

Thus propitiated, the preceptor shall make the disciple take his bath after testing him thus. The disciple shall stay with him for a year and serve him: He shall be pure and devoid of egotism. He shall become emaciated due to constant fasts. The preceptor shall then bless the disciple with the Excellent perfect knowledge of Siva in a holy place at an auspicious hour: The place may be the shore of the sea or the bank of a river, the cowpen or a temple, or a clean place in the house.

itself. The time shall be a Tithi conducive to the fulfilment of desires; the constellation and the junction of planets shall be auspicious: It shall be devoid of defects in every respect: Even in the isolated place the preceptor shall utter the mantra loudly and legibly with delighted mind.

96. The preceptor shall utter himself and make the disciple utter after him. He shall then bestow Siddhi (on the disciple) saying, "May there be auspiciousness: Nay it be splendid. May it be pleasing."

97. After acquiring the great Mantra and perfect knowledge from the preceptor the disciple shall repeat it every day with the due Samkalpa. He shall perform Purascarana too.

98-99. As long as he lives, he shall repeat this a thousand and eight times every day: Without repeating it; he shall not take food. Thus interested in it he attains the greatest goal: He who repeats this Mantra a hundred thousand times for each syllable and then repeats it four times with great attention is known as one who has made Purascarana. He shall take food only at night. He shall be self-controlled:

100. A person who seeks for Siddhi, ere long; shall be one of these two; either a Purascarana repeater or daily repeater:

101. If a devotee performs Purascarana and continues to be a daily repeater too, there is no one else in the world who is equally accomplished; self-controlled and competent to bestow Siddhis: Sitting in a comfortable posture he shall be silent.

102-103. facing with his mind fully concentrated. He may sit facing the east or the north and then repeat the excellent Mantra: At the beginning of the japa and at its conclusion he shall restrain his breath. In the end, he shall repeat the excellent Bija mantra hundred and eight times in all:

104-105. The devotee shall restrain the breath forty times and repeat the mantra. Thus the Pranayama for the five-syllabled Mantra has been cited: Thanks to Pranayama, his sins will be destroyed soon and the sense-organs shall become controlled. Hence, one shall practise Pranayama.

river it is hundred thousand times more efficacious; if it is in the presence of Siva it is endless.

107. The japa performed on the seashore in divine pond; on mountain, in temple and in a sacred hermitage has crore times the benefit:

108. The rite of japa is commended if it is in the presence of Siva or in front of the sun, the preceptor, the lamps cow or water. O lady of auspicious face; if the

109-141. number of the repetitions is reckoned on the fingers it has the ordinary benefit; if lines are drawn and the number is calculated the benefit is said to be eight times more; if it is reckoned by means of the fruits of Putrajiva it has ten times more benefit; if it is calculated by means of conches and jewels the benefit is hundred times more; through coral the benefit a thousand times more; it is ten thousand times more, if the reckoning is through crystals; it is hundred thousand times more if the calculation is by pearls; it is one million times more if the calculation is by lotus-seeds; if it is calculated by pieces the benefit is ten million times more: The benefit is infinite if the calculation is by knots of Kusa grass or Rudraksa beads:

112-115. The necklace of twenty-five beads is conducive to salvation; that of twenty-seven is nourishing; that of thirty is conducive to the achievement of wealth and that of fifty pertains to black magic.

If the devotee faces the east and performs the japa it is Vasya (i.e: he will be able to attract others); facing the south pertains to Abhicara; facing the west bestows wealth and facing the north is conducive to quiescence: liberation; the One should know that the thumb bestows

finger index finger destroys enemies; the middle yields wealth; the ring finger causes quiescence: O splendid lady, in the rite of japa the little finger bestows protection: The devotee shall perform japa with the thumb coming into contact with other fingers:

116. Any holy rite performed without the thumb is fruitless. Listen. The japayajma excels all other sacrifices:

117-148. All the ritualistic sacrifices; charitable gifts and austerities do not merit even a sixteenth fraction of the japa-

The other yajias are attended with violence or killing but japayajia has nothing to do with violence: Now the greatness of only the Vacika (i.e chanting with audible voice) japa-yajna has been glorified.

# 119-122.

The Upamsu (mumbling) is hundred times more efficacious than verbal and the Manasa (mental) is thousand times more efficacious than mumbling:

If one utters the mantra clearly with highly accented or lowly accented tones or without either, that japayajma is called Vacika (verbal). If one utters the mantra with low tone, making the lips throb slightly and making only some sounds audible; that Japa is called Upamsu (mumbling). If the devotee ponders over the meaning of the words letter by letter and proceeds ahead with the series of syllables that japa is called Minasa (mental): Of the three japayajnas the latter one excels the earlier one.

# 123-127.

The quality of the benefit varies according to the mode of yajna. If the deity is eulogised continuously by japa it becomes pleased and on being pleased it shall bestow extensive pleasures and permanent liberation. Neither the yaksas nor the Raksasas, neither the Pisacas nor the terrible and evil planets even approach the person doing the japa. They are frightened all round. One shall entirely suppress by means of japa all the sins committed in a number of previous births. One wins worldly pleasures, Siddhis and liberation and also conquers death by means of japa:

After thus acquiring perfect knowledge pertaining to Siva and after understanding the procedure for the japa the devotee shall abide by good conduct: Continuously meditating thus, he attains welfare:

I shall now mention sadacara (good conduct) that is the perfect means of Dharma (virtue).

# 128.

Since performance devoid of good conduct shall be fruitless good conduct is the greatest virtue; the greatest penance: Good conduct is the greatest learning:

# 129.

Good conduct shall be fearless everywhere:

# The glory of the five-syllabled Mantra

130-133. Similarly men devoid of good conduct shall meet with fear everywhere: A lady of excellent face, people attain Deva-hood and sage-hood by observing good conduct: Similarly, by transgressing good conduct they attain birth in lower and base state of society: A person who has eschewed good conduct becomes despicable. Hence, one who seeks perfect accomplishment shall scrupulously cling to the good conduct: One who is wicked in conduct and activity is sinful. He is mostly unclean. He defiles perfect knowledge:

Hence, one shall assiduously perform the holy rites prescribed for respective castes and stages in life:

134-140. One who performs the rites laid down for him is always my favourite: In the evening and in the morning he shall practise worship with delighted mind. He shall begin the rite, clean in mind and body before sunrise and before sunset and perform it duly. A brahmin shall not transgress Sandhya due to lust, delusion, fear or covetousness. Since by giving up Sandhya prayers, the brahmin falls off from the status of brahminhood:

One shall not tell lies. Nor shall one eschew truth; say that truth is Brahman: Hence, untruth defiles the Brahman. These are all causes of sins: viz, untruth, harshness (in speech), stubbornness and back-biting. Not even mentally, verbally or physically shall one violate others' wives, or take away others' wealth or injure others: Sudra,

One shall eschew the cooked rice of a Sudra, the cooked rice that is stale; the Naivedya offering, the Sraddha (partaking of food therein), the cooked rice for the masses and at social functions or served as the doles by the king: The purity of the character is based on the purity of food and not by means of clay or water. One can attain Siddhi only when there is purity of character. Hence, he should be scrupulous about the food he takes:

141. Even those brahmins who are expounders of Brahman are defiled by accepting gifts from their patrons, kings, etc. There is no rebirth unto those who are defiled by taking gifts, as unto the seeds that are heated in fire.

142. Gift from kings is sinful. It is comparable to poison. After realising this at the outset it shall be avoided by learned man as he shall avoid the flesh of a dog:

143. One shall not take food without taking bath, or performing japa or worshipping the fire. One shall not take food on the outer side of a leaf. At night one shall not take food without a lamp.

144-145. One shall never take food in open street, and in the presence of fallen people. One shall not take food partly consumed by a Sudra nor shall one take conked rice along with infants. One shall take in only pure food which is unctuous, emollient; consecrated and inspired with mantras. While taking food one shall remember that it is Siva who eats. He shall keep silent and concentrated.

146. One shall not drink water, sipping standing, through folded hands; nor with the left hand or seated on bed even with the right hand.

147. One shall not resort to Arka, Karanja and Snuhize trees; nor shall one stand in the shadow of a pillar, lamppost, human beings and other animals.

148. One shall not go on long journey by oneself nor cross a river with one's hands; one shall never descend into a well nor climb tall trees.

149. O splendid lady, one shall never perform religious actions, japas and other holy rites with the face turned away from the sun, fire, water, Devas and the preceptors.

150. One shall not warm one's feet over the fire; one shall not touch the hand by means of legs; one shall not occupy a lofty place above the fire; one shall never cast impurities or ordure into the fire or water with the feet.

151. One shall never kick the dirt of the limbs into the water. After washing the dirt on the banks one shall take one's bath.

152. The water shaken off from the tip of the nail or hairs, from the garments after bath and from the water pot, is conducive to misfortune: If one touches it, it is impure.

153. If a man of deluded mind touches husks and dust particles licked up and raised by goat, dog, donkey.

# The glory of the five-syllabled Mantra

A man who keeps a cat in his house is on par with a low caste person. If a man feeds leading brahmins in the presence of a cat, it shall be considered to be similar to the act of Candala. No doubt need be entertained in this respect: The wind from the buttocks, the wind from the winnowing basket, the wind coming out of the mouths of animals, all these coming into contact with a person dispel his merits.

One shall never perform japa wearing a turban or coat of mail. If one is naked or one has loosened the knots of hairs, or is dirty or is impure or has impure hands, he shall not perform japa. He shall not perform japa while conversing with others.

All these are inimical to japa, viz. anger, arrogance, inebriation, thirst, lethargy, spitting, yawning, seeing a dog or base man, slumber, and prattling: When these occur one shall look at the sun and get purified.

By the sun the following are meant: The sun; moon, planets, stars and constellations - these are called Juminaries. When anger, etc. occur one shall perform Acamana or Pranayama and then continue the japa.

One shall not perform japa keeping the legs stretched: One shall not sit in the cock posture at the time of japa. Nor shall one be lying down; without sitting on a seat: The repeater of the mantras shall not perform japa in the open street, or in the presence of the Sudras or in a ground smeared with blood, or sitting in a cot: The devotee shall mentally think about the meaning of mantra.

Seated on a cozy seat he shall perform japa perfectly. He shall have any of the following for a seat: viz, a silk cloth, tiger skin; a cotton cloth, an upper cloth or cotton quilt, wooden plank or a palmyra leaf. The worship of the preceptor shall be performed in all the three Sandhyas by one who wishes for welfare: He who is the preceptor is also Siva. He who is Siva is the preceptor: As is Siva so is the learning; as is the learning so is the preceptor; The knowledge about Siva is obtained from the preceptor. The benefit accrues in accordance with devotion.

The disciple shall bear the behests of his preceptor on his head (i.e., he shall obey him) whether he is with or without good qualities. He who seeks welfare shall not transgress, even mentally, the behests of the preceptor. One who strictly conforms to the biddings of the preceptor attains the wealth of knowledge: Whatever he does in the presence of the preceptor shall be done with the permission of the preceptor viz. going, standing, sleeping, eating, etc. Neither in front of the preceptor nor in the presence of the deity shall he be complacently seated as he pleases, since the preceptor is the lord himself and his house is the temple of the lord: If one comes into contact with sinners one will have downfall due to their sins. If one comes into contact with the preceptor one shall incur the benefit of his holy rites. Just as the ghee in a pot placed near fire becomes melted so also the sin of a person near the preceptor becomes dissolved. Just as the blazing fire burns ordure and lumber so also the contented preceptor burns sins by means of the power of his mantra. Undoubtedly

if the preceptor is satisfied, Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Devas and sages are also satisfied and they bless him. One shall never infuriate the preceptor physically, mentally or verbally. By his wrath are burned the longevity, fortune, wisdom and good holy rites. The sacrifices of those who infuriate him are futile: His japas and other observances are also futile. No doubt need be entertained in this respect: One shall assiduously refrain from making any statement against the preceptor: If out of great delusion he speaks it out, he will fall into Raurava hell: O fair lady, never should one falsely cheat the preceptor mentally, or verbally or physically or monetarily: If he proclaims the wicked qualities of his preceptor he will have hundred times that wickedness. If he proclaims the good qualities he will have the benefit of all good qualities. Whether directed or not; he shall always do what is beneficent and pleasing to the preceptor.

180-181. Whether within sight or out of sight of the preceptor, one shall do what is beneficent or pleasing to the preceptor. If he does anything against him mentally, physically or verbally, he goes down and revolves there itself: Hence; he should be worshipped and saluted always.

182-185. The disciple shall speak to the preceptor only after getting permission from him even when he is nearby. Otherwise he shall not look at him straight in the face: The disciple who adheres to all these rules, who is devout, who is perpetually engaged in japa and who does everything pleasing to his preceptor deserves to utilise the Mantra: I shall mention the application and the purpose of the Mantra that has been accomplished. If the devotee does not know the mode of application, the mantra becomes ineffective: That should be known as Viniyoga whereby the desired benefit is put in conjunction with the activity. It is the benefit of this world as well as of the next: The benefit arising out of Viniyoga is longevity, health, the permanence of the body, kingdom, royal glory, perfect knowledge; heaven and salvation.

186-193. The following rites shall be performed by repeating the five-syllabled Mantra eleven times: Proksana (ritualistic sprinkling with water); Abhiseka (ablution); Aghamarsana (praying for forgiveness for sins) and the two baths - one at dawn and one at day: The intelligent devotee shall be clean and after climbing the mountain shall alertfully repeat the mantra a hundred thousand times, or two hundred thousand times on the banks of a great river; he will attain long life: Ten thousand Homas with the following materials of worship are conducive to longevity viz: The sprouts of the Durva grass, gingelly seeds, Vani, Guduci and Ghutika.

# The sacrifice of meditation

The sages said:

1. The brahmins who have destroyed their sins say that the meritorious sacrifice of meditation is better than japa for unattached and enlightened persons.
2. Hence, O Suta, tell us today about the sacrifice of meditation suited for unattached noble souls in detail and with all effort: On hearing those words of the noble sages who had performed the sacrifice of long duration, Suta recounted to them what Rudra of universal action mentioned after neutralising the poison Kalakuta and entering his cave.
3. The sages of great discipline bowed down to Siva who entered the cave and seated himself comfortably along with Bhavani. All of them, then, eulogised Nilakantha, the consort of Uma:
4. O lord; O bull-bannered lord, the Kalakuta has been neutralised by you: Hence everything has been stabilised by you:
5. On hearing their words, lord Nilalohita, the Atman of the Universe, smilingly said to those sages, Sanandana and others.

60 excellent brahmins, of what consequence is this? I shall mention another more terrible poison: He who nullifies that poison is really efficient: Of what avail is this?

What is called Kalakuta is not at all poison when compared to worldly existence which is the real poison. Hence, with all efforts one shall try to dispel that terrible poison:

The mundane existence is two-fold in accordance with one's rights and duties. In regard to men of deluded minds, the mundane existence is very terrible and burdensome. O sages of good holy rites, creation is caused by ignorance due to the defects of malice and attachment. It is certainly due to these, that virtue and evil befall everyone: O brahmins, even in regard to things not near at hand, the scripture creates desire for them even in the minds of good men in the world merely by hearing of it. Hence, the perceptible world and the world of Vedic tradition and rituals both should be eschewed with great effort: He then becomes Virakta (unattached person) altogether.

That portion of the Vedas which deals with rituals is called scripture, O brahmins. It is the principal essence of the Vedas. The benefit of the rites goes to the sages.

Those who do not know these things say: "Desire is natural in everyone. The opposite is not seen. It is the Veda that makes them work (for fulfilling such desires):

16. The virtue of renunciation from worldly affairs, is intended for efficient persons. Hence; it is said that worldly existence is caused by ignorance of all embodied persons:

17-18a. The Digit is dried up due to Karman or the nature of others. Individuals endowed with Kalas are of three types. They are devoid of perfect knowledge due to ignorance: The three types are (a) those destined to fall into hell because they commit sin; (b) those destined to go to heaven because they perform meritorious deeds and they go to heaven due to the weight of their merit and (c) a mixture of these two living beings.

18b-19. The living beings are classified under four heads, viz: Udbhijjas (germinating plants), Svedajas (born of sweat, i.e. germs and worms), Andajas (oviparous beings), and Jarayuja (viviparous). Thus the ignorant embodied being does not get relief through Karman through their actions.

20. Salvation is not attained by good men, progeny, through actions, or through wealth. Liberation shall occur only through renunciation. He wanders in the world due to the absence of it (renunciation) as a result of ignorance.

21. Thus due to the fault of ignorance and various Karmans; the individual soul adopts a body produced by six KoSas (vestures) that be faced by the individual in the womb; in the vaginal passage; on the earth, in boyhood; in youth; in old age and in death:

22. Many miseries are to be faced by the individual.

0 brahmins, if duly pondered over, good men have to face only misery through the contact with women and similar activities. The miserable try to quell one misery only by another misery:

Lust is never quelled by means of enjoyment of pleasures. Just as fire blazes all the more by Havis (ghee offering) also lust is inflamed all the more by indulging into pleasure.

Hence, on pondering over, it will be seen that there is no happiness unto men even due to coitus: There is misery in earning wealth as also in preserving and spending it, 0 excellent brahmins, if we ponder over it, there is misery amongst the Pisacas; Raksasas, Yaksas, Gandharvas, in the world of the moon, in the world of mercury, in the world of Prajapati, in the world of the Brahman, in the world of Prakrti and Purusa also. 0 sages of good holy rites, there are miseries due to destruction of possessions, due to one's possession being excelled by another's, etc; These cause only other miseries.

One shall eschew those impure fortunes and riches. Hence, 0 sinless sages of good holy rites, all kinds of pleasures are really miseries to the discriminating person in whatever way you view them, viz, eightfold or sixteenfold or of twenty-four, thirty-two, forty-eight, fifty-six, or sixty-four types. The pleasures of the following types are undoubtedly miseries if pondered over properly even to those yogins who talk of Brahman: Parthiva (earthly), Apya (watery), Taijasa (fiery), Vayavya (gaseous), Vyauma (of the firmament), Manasa (mental), Abhimanika (bringing pride), Bauddha (intellectual), Prakrta (pertaining to Prakrti).

The attributes of the leaders of the Ganas are, on reflection, causes of misery. In all the worlds, there is always misery in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end: The present ones are miseries, the future ones are miseries. In the lands defiled by faults, there are various kinds of miseries.

The sacrifice of meditation

Those who consider ignorance as knowledge do not consider the past events. Just as the medicine is used to dispel ailments and not for positive pleasure, so also the food taken in is intended for dispelling the sickness of hunger and not for any positive happiness. In the different seasons, the embodied beings undergo miseries through chillness, heat, wind, rains, etc. There is no doubt about it; but the ignorant do not consider it that way. Excellent sages, even in the heaven, the same thing happens through the destruction, etc. of the merit; 781

Just as the tree whose roots have been cut falls down to the ground helplessly, so also the living being overwhelmed by various kinds of ailments, passion, hatred, fear, etc. 782

Similarly, the heaven-dwellers fall down to the earth due to the destruction of the tree of merit. Even for heaven-dwellers who desire for things that cause misery and who are richly endowed with pleasures that cause misery, there is terrible misery when they fall from that heaven. There is definitely misery in hell due to the fact that even religious students resort to it when they do not perform those rites that are laid down; O leading sages.

Just as the deer frightened of death and uprooted from his habitation does not obtain sleep, so also the noble-souled ascetic engaged in meditation and frightened of the worldly existence does not obtain slumber. In germs, birds, animals, deer, elephants, and horses, unhappiness is seen even.

Hence there is great happiness unto a man who renounces:

O sages of good holy rites, there is misery unto even those officers on duty spread over the whole kalpa who move about in aerial chariots, unto Manu and others who take pride in their respective positions.

46-48. In fact, the Asramas or exhaustion (Srama) unto the different castes. People do not attain the Atman through Asramas (stages in life), Vedas, yajnas, Samkhyas (numerical knowledge), vratas (holy rites), severe penances, different kinds of charitable gifts, etc. But people with knowledge obtain it: Hence, with all efforts one shall perform the Pasupata rite: In the holy rite of Pasupata, the learned devotee shall perpetually lie on bhasman; besmeared with ashes.

49-50. The learned devotee, richly endowed with the knowledge of the five objects and having great attention towards the principle of Siva shall adopt the yoga that causes salvation and destroys fate and karma and shall become intelligent and endowed with the yoga of five objects.783 Thereby he attains the end of misery. The devotees understand the knowable by means of Para Vidya and not by Apara Vidya.

51-54. Two Vidyas (topics of knowledge) are to be known: Para and Apara, O excellent brahmins, Apara consists of Rg, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva Vedas. Siksha, Kalpa, grammar; semantics, prosody and astrology also constitute Apara Vidya. What is imperishable is the Para. It is imperceptible; incomprehensible: It has no spiritual lineage, no caste; no colour, no eyes; no ears; no hands and no feet; O excellent brahmins, it is not born: It has no past: It is not describable by words.

55-58. It has no touch, no form, no taste; no smell, no change; no support: It is perpetual, omnipresent and all-powerful. It is great and massive: O brahmins, it is unborn and identical with cit (consciousness); it is devoid of Pranas (vital airs); it has no mind; it is non-emollient and it is devoid of blood. It is incomprehensible; it is neither stout nor long; it is.

Not excessively clear; it is not short; it is impassable; it is bliss; it is unswerving; not open; without second; infinite; not perceivable, and not covered; Para is identical with the Atman78 and not otherwise.

But these Para and Apara are not the real. I alone am identical with the universe; the universe is in me alone.

Everything originates from me, stays within me and gets dissolved in me; there is nothing different from me: This shall be realised mentally, verbally and physically. The devotee shall with concentration see everything: the 'sat' (the existent) and the 'asat' (the non-existent) in the Atman. One seeing everything in the Atman does not allow the mind to stray to other objects.

On lowering the vision, one shall see the Atman stationed in Vitasti above the umbilicus in the heart; the abode of the universe:

In the middle of this heart is stationed the lotus72 with dharma for its bulbous root and knowledge for its splendid stalk. The eight accomplishments are its eight petals; vairagya (detachment) is its white pericarp; the quarters are its pores filled with the vital airs. Due order on being united with Prana, etc; O leading sages, each of the veins (Nadis) carries the ten Pranas (vital airs). Altogether there are seventy-two thousand Nadis. The Jagrat (waking stage) is stationed in the eyes, the svapna (dream stage) in the neck; the susupta (sleeping stage) in the heart and turiya (the fourth above the three) in the head. The presiding deity in the jagrat state is Brahma; in Svapna Vishnu; Isvara in Sushupti and in Turiya Maheshvara.

Others say as follows: when the person is in full possession of his senses and organs it is called Jagrat; when only the four organs, mind, intellect, ego and citta function, it is Svapna. O sage of good holy rites, when the organs and senses are merged into the Atman786.

# 72-79

The four states Jagrat (wakefulness), Svapna (dream), Sugupti (slumber) and Turiya (the fourth) have been mentioned. I shall now describe the Adhibhautika, Adhyatmika and Adhidaivika terms, O leading brahmins. It should be known by the learned that all these are myself great sages, the Adhyatmika (organic) is said to be fourteen in all, viz, the sense organs (five), the organs of action (five) and the mind, intellect, ego, and will (four).

O excellent sages, the following constitute the Adhibhautika (the extraneous matter), viz.- what should be seen, what should be heard; what should be smelt; what should be tested, what should be touched; what should be thought of, what should be understood, what should be taken pride in, what should be willed; what should be spoken; what should be grasped, what should be traversed, what should be evacuated and what should be enjoyed:

The following fourteen constitute the Adhidaivika (the Divine factor), viz- the sun, quarters, earth, Varuna (water), wind, Brahma, Rudra, Ksetrajna, Agni, Indra, Visnu, moon, lord Mitra and Prajapati.

# 80-81

The following are fourteen Nadis (tubular vessels) - viz. Rajni, Sudarfana, Jita, Saumya, Mogha, Rudra, Mrta, (Amrta), Satya, Madhyama, Nadira, Sisuka, Asura, Krttika and Bhasvati: fourteen carrying winds stationed in the middle of Nadis:

# 82-87

They are Prana, Vyana, Apana, Udana, Samana, Vairambha, the important Antaryama, Prabhaijana, Kirmaka, Syena, Sveta, Krspa, Anila and Naga. I am the lord present in all these as the great Atman and the devotees shall worship me: I am present, O sages of good holy rites, in the eyes, in what is to be seen; in the sun, in the Nadi, in the Prana (five types) in the Vijnana, and in ananda (bliss), in the heart; in the firmament, and within all these: I am the sole Atman, moving within. The lord is ageless, infinite, devoid of sorrow, immortal and stable: He is the sole being.

# 88.

The omniscient Being is only one: There is only one lord of all. He is the overlord of all. He is the immanent soul of great lustre:

# 89.

On being worshipped, the eternal lord grants happiness: O excellent brahmins, if one does not worship him one does not attain happiness.

# 90.

He is being worshipped by the Vedas and other scriptures. But this omniscient lord does not go unto them for succour.

# 91.

This visible universe is his Anna (food). He does not become the Anna himself unto anyone else. Nowhere does one devour Anna guarded by one's own self.

# 92.

I am the food taken in by the living beings everywhere: I am the knot of the living beings and I bring about all great things: I am five-fold Atman divided into several parts.

# 93.

I am the soul of the living beings identical with Anna. What is taken in is called Anna. I am the soul of the sense-organs identical with Prana (vital breaths). I am the soul of mental conceptions identical with the mind;

# 94.

As Soma I am Kalatman (the soul of Time), identical with Vijiana (perfect knowledge). As Mahesa Paramesvara I become identical with Ananda (Bliss).

# 95.

Thus I am the entire universe stationed in me. I am independent but everything is dependent on me. This can be understood on pondering over the real form of various things: being one (i.e: ekatva) is not present.

# 96.

Even the state of the lord stationed in the subtle body is the source of pleasure for others but he has no source of pleasure for himself:

The lord is the source of food for others but he has no source of food for himself: Cf. Bhagavadgit:

Padcakofa or Pancakaicuka of Saiva philosophy constitute the five phases of the self-luminous lord. They are the products of Avarana-takti (power of concealment) of Maya (lord's power of projection).

100. When it is pleased and concentrated in a single form it is known as Jhana (Perfect knowledge). Everything else is Ajhana (Ignorance). No doubt need be entertained in this regard: Perfect clear knowledge certainly originates from contact with the preceptor. It is uncontaminated by lust, hatred, falsehood, anger, passion, covetousness and the like. It should be known as the bestower of salvation. Since the man has the impurity of ignorance he is contaminated. Salvation takes place only when impurity is dispelled and not otherwise, perfect knowledge even if one takes a crore of births. Without merit nor demerit is destroyed. Hence, 0 most excellent ones among the knowers of the Brahman, practise knowledge alone as the means of liberation. It is only by practice of perfect knowledge that the intellect of men becomes free from impurities:

Alone and who has eschewed all contacts with worldly objects has no further duty. If he has, he is no longer a knower of reality. Neither in this world nor in the other has he any duty, since he is a liberated soul. Hence, the knower of Brahman is the knower of the reality of perfect knowledge and perpetually engaged in the practice of perfect knowledge: He eschews the practice of all duties. He obtains perfect knowledge alone: O excellent brahmins, if one who takes pride in his position in varnasrama (as Brahmin, ksatriya, etc.) takes pleasure in other things (other than Brahman) certainly he is deluded and ignorant, even though he might have discarded anger. Ignorance is the cause of worldly existence and adoption of physical bodies means worldly existence:

Similarly, Jnana (perfect knowledge) is the cause of salvation. The liberated man abides in his own Atman: O leading brahmins, there is no doubt about this that wrath etc. occur only when there is ignorance: Wrath, delight, covetousness, delusion, arrogance, virtue and evil, all these, O excellent brahmins, cause adoption of physical bodies.

There is distress and pain only when there is body: Hence, the learned shall eschew Avidya (Ignorance, illusion). Only if the yogin eschews Avidya by means of Vidya do anger, virtue, evil etc. perish, O brahmins. If they perish the (Atman) is not united further with the physical body: He is liberated from mundane existence: He is devoid of the three types of miseries. Thus, O leading brahmins, the meditator cannot meditate without perfect knowledge:

Perfect knowledge is obtained by personal contact with the preceptor and not through words in fact. After realizing the Caturvyuha thus and after deep thinking, one shall practice meditation.

118. There is no doubt that all the sins of Jnanin shall perish: Even if he indulges in dalliance he is not affected by sins.

119-120. As is knowledge so is meditation: Hence, one should practise meditation. At the outset meditation is laid down as Savisaya (having an object) and then Nirvisaya (having no object). The leading yogin shall practise meditation in six ways as follows: for the duration of two, four, six, ten, twelve and sixteen units of time in order. Certainly he shall be liberated.

At the outset he meditates on a form as resplendent as pure or like the burning coal without smoke; of golden yellow, red or white colour or having the lustre similar to that of a crore of lightning streaks. Or the meditator keeps his mind assiduously stationed in the Brahmarandhra (cerebral orifice). He shall remember that it (the object of meditation) is neither white nor black nor yellow. He shall thereby become the knower of Brahman. He shall be non-violent, truthful in speech, and non-stealer: He shall by all means maintain celibacy and avoid gifts. He shall be stable in observing holy rites, contented, richly endowed with cleanliness and always engaged in the study of the Vedas. He shall be devoted to me and practise meditation, of course, as instructed by the preceptor: fixing his mind,

In waters lord Bhava; I am Rudra in fire; Ugra in wind; in firmament, I am Bhima; in the sphere of Sun I am Isana and in lunar disc as Mahadeva.

1316-137. Everything firm and solid in body is spoken of as pertaining to the earth; what is liquid in form pertains to water; what is called colour belongs to Agni (fire); what moves about is Vayu (wind). O excellent brahmins, what appears like a hole is the firmament:

O brahmins, perfect knowledge originating from sound is born of firmament; similarly, the knowledge of what is called 'touch' originates from Vayu; that of Rupa (colour) from Vahni; O brahmins, what belongs to water is full of taste; and what is called 'smell' belongs to the earth:

Again he shall meditate in order: the sun in the right eye; the moon in the left eye; the lord in the heart; the principle of earth up to the knee; the sphere of water up to the umbilicus; the principle of fire up to the neck; the principle of wind up to the forehead. Beginning with the forehead and ending with the tuft is the principle called firmament; above the firmament and beyond that is the Brahman called Harsa. This first entity called Vyoman is stationed in the middle of firmament:

138-139. These principles including the first entity Jiva, Prakrti, sattva, rajas, tamas, intellect; the ego, the subtle elements, the sense-organs, the elements beginning with ether are not real. Because he stands steady pervading the universe he is called Sthanu.

801. The verses describe the method of padcatattva-devata-dhyans in the gavikalpeka tamadhi.

802. This refers to the atta-murti-devata-dhyans.

803. In fact, meditation, its varieties and ancillaries are all due to maya—the lord's power of projection. Actually, meditation, meditator and the object meditated upon are all unreal, vide Pafkadast vi. 35.

140-142. It is at the behest of Bhava that the frightened sun rises, the wind blows and purifies, the moon shines, the fire blazes, waters flow, the earth holds aloft and the firmament gives room: Hence, O brahmins, one shall think about all these: excellent brahmins, all these are presided over by him alone: One shall remember Bhava, thinking that he is identical with all forms in the universe.

143. To those who are scorched by the poison of mundane existence, the only antidote is the nectar-like perfect knowledge and meditation. O excellent brahmins, no other solution has been laid down anywhere:

144. Perfect knowledge originates directly from Dharma (virtue) - Vairagya (detachment) originates from knowledge; from Vairagya arises the supreme knowledge that illuminates the true meanings of objects.

145. O excellent brahmins; he who is endowed with knowledge and detachment attains Yogic Siddhi. One who abides by sattva guna attains liberation through yogic siddhi and not otherwise.

146. It is surprising that his unchanging region is covered by the words tamas and Avidya. O brahmins, one should adopt Sattvasakti (the power of Sattvaguna) and worship Siva.

147-152a. My devotee abides by the sattva guna. He is engrossed in my worship. He clings to virtue in every respect: He is enthusiastic always. He is endowed with concentration: He is bold and endures all Dvandvas (mutually clashing pairs). He is engaged in the welfare of all living beings. He is straightforward by nature: He is continuously healthy and normal in his mind: He is always soft-natured. He is not arrogant. He is intelligent and quiescent: O excellent brahmins, he eschews rivalry. He is always desirous of liberation. He is conversant with virtue. He is marked with the characteristics of the supreme soul. He is released from the threefold indebtedness in the previous birth and is meritorious.

Thanks to the contact with Janin (a man with knowledge), he shall acquire perfect knowledge and become conversant with yoga. O excellent brahmins, this is the order in which one full of impurities attains perfect knowledge: Hence; O leading sages, he shall proceed along this path and be steady in his holy rite: Eschewing attachment with worldly objects he is liberated from the poison Kalakuta in the form of the worldly existence: Thug, succinctly, I have incidentally recounted to you the greatness of perfect knowledge that is splendid and unswerving:

O leading sages, this Pasupata yoga mentioned by Isvara, Siva should not be given to anyone and everyone: It should be imparted gladly to a yogin who always clings to Bhasman: The man who reads this chapter on suppression of worldly existence or listens to it certainly attains Sayujya with the Brahman.

He who is bound by Maya and disillusioned is the one who is entangled in Karmans. O brahmins, the Atman has neither knowledge nor meditation, neither bondage nor liberation.

There is no doubt that he is stationed after the two forms. When there is a contact with Vijhana (perfect knowledge) at the behest of Paramesthin, liberation occurs within a moment and not otherwise, even with crores of holy rites. Here the order intended for the living beings is not applicable: By the grace of Paramesthin liberation takes place in trice: This is undoubtedly the vow of the lord. The creature (i.e. individual soul) is liberated, thanks to the grace of Paramesthin even when he is in the womb or when he is born, or when he is a boy, a young man or an old man: By the grace of the lord of Devas every living being is liberated whether it is oviparous or plant or one born of sweat: No doubt need be entertained in this regard:

He alone is the lord of the worlds; Siva is the cause of bondage and liberation. The worlds viz: Bhuh, Bhuvah; Svah, Mahah, Jana, Tapas and Satya the innumerable Cosmic Eggs as well as the eight coverings of the Cosmic Egg constitute the body of the lord.

# Review of PaSupata Yoga

The Sages said:

By what yoga do the men obtain good attributes? How do the yogins become endowed with Anima and other siddhis? O Suta, it behoves you to recount everything in detail now.

Suta said:

1. Henceforth, I shall recount the yoga, extremely difficult of access. At the outset, the devotee shall remember the eternal deity after fixing him in the mind in five different forms.
2. Excellent brahmins, he shall fix the lotus posture accompanied by the moon, sun, and fire. It shall be combined with the twenty-six Saktis. Thereafter, O brahmins, the devotee shall remember the lord, the consort of Uma, in the middle first in eight ways, then in sixteen and again in twelve ways.
3. He shall remember the unborn lord of eight cosmic bodies, accompanied by eight Saktis, along with them Rudras of eight types and then of sixty-four types. Similarly, all the Saktis endowed with the eight Gunas are to be remembered. After obtaining perfect knowledge gradually one shall adopt this procedure: Pasupati.
4. The yoga pertaining to Pasupati is one that bestows salvation: O brahmins, only he who practices the yoga does get the attributes, Anima, etc. and not otherwise, even through crores of holy rites.

Review of Pasupata Yoga

9-10. Anima (minuteness), Laghima (lightness), Mahima (greatness), Prapti (the power of obtaining anything), Prakamya (irresistible will), Isitva (lordship) over everything, Vasitva (ability to make others subservient), and Kamavasayita (when everything happens according to one's desires), these are eight types. This Aisvarya desired by everyone should be known as of three types: Savadya, Niravadya, and Suksma. What is termed Savadyais of the nature of five elements.

The function of the Suksma (subtle) is in respect of the sense organs, mind, and ego. The function is again of the nature of five elements. The sense-organs, mind, will, intellect, and ego - the Atman comes into contact with all these. This three-fold contact functions only in the subtle things. Again, the eight attributes are laid down only in the subtle forms. I shall mention their nature as described by the lord and they are known among all living beings of the three worlds:

16. The Anima, etc: are self-evident: They are well established everywhere: They are cited as difficult of access to all living beings in the three worlds.

17-19. On attaining the first Aisvarya, the devotee gets the power of the yogins. This will make him assume such forms that will enable him to cross or float (on water or air). The second (Laghima) is known as the attainment of great quickness (Sighratva) among all living beings. In all the three worlds, honour among all living beings is due to one's greatness. Therefore, the third yoga (i.e., Aisvarya) is called Mahitva (=Mahima) in the world. Prapti enables one to mix at one's will and pleasure with all living beings in the three worlds:

20. By Prakamya, the devotee enjoys all desired objects. It is through obstruction somewhere that happiness and misery are brought about in all living beings in the three worlds.

21. The knower of the yoga Isitva (sixth Aisvarya) becomes the overlord everywhere in every stage. In the three worlds consisting of the mobile and immobile beings, all the living beings become subservient to him. This is Vasitva, the seventh Aisvarya.

22. Where there is Kamavasayitva (the eighth and highest Aisvarya), forms occur and cease to be as the devotee wishes.



---


Lingopurana

among all the three worlds consisting of the mobile and immobile beings:

23. When all these Siddhis or Aisvaryas are attained, sound, touch, taste, smell, colour and the mind; all function or cease to function as the devotee wishes.

24-27. He is neither born nor dies. He is neither cut nor pierced: He is neither burned nor illusioned. He is neither attracted nor afflicted by anything: He does not waste away nor does he perish. He is never depressed and he is not at all change; he undergoes change: He is devoid of smell, taste and colour, touch or sound, He has no colour or caste. He has no tone; everywhere he is without an equal. He enjoys the objects of pleasure, but he does not become attached to any. Thanks to his being minute; he is extremely subtle. Thanks to his being subtle, he is worthy of salvation:

28. Thanks to salvation, he is all-pervasive; he is called Purusa. Due to his subtle nature; Purusa is stationed in the greatest Aisvarya (prosperity and glory).

29-30. The Aisvaryas are said to be subtler and greater in ascending order all round. After obtaining the excellent Yoga and the unimpeded Aisvaryas, one shall attain salvation. That is the greatest subtle goal. O leading sages, the yoga pertaining to Pasupati should be known thus.

31-32. It bestows the benefits of heaven and salvation. It is the cause of identity with Siva: Or, one who has no perfect knowledge may perform holy rites due to attachments. After enjoying Rajasa and Tamasa pleasures he is liberated there itself (i.e. in this world). Similarly, he who performs meritorious deeds attains the benefit in heaven.

33-37. But the moment his merits are exhausted the excellent man reverts to the mortal world from that abode: Hence Brahman is the greatest happiness. Brahman is the best and permanent goal: One shall resort to the Brahman alone: Brahman alone is the greatest happiness. All yajnas are mere waste of energy and no good results from them: One becomes prey to death by resorting to Yajnas. So liberation is the sole happiness. After seeing the divine Purusa of universal names with faces all round, the devotee, engaged in meditation, devoutly engrossed in the principle of the Brahman can -

Revicw %f pdfupata yoga
not be dislodged even in hundreds of manvantaras. The divine Purusa has universal feet, heads and necks. He is lord of the universe. He has universal forms (colours) and smell. The universe is his garland. He is the lord wearing the universal clothes. The rays of the sun fall on the earth but do not go back to the sun and reproduce him.

One can see the lord only through yoga and not by the eye - the lord who is the ancient sage, who is subtler than the subtlest; who is the chastiser; who is greater than the greatest, golden-coloured Purusa without sense-organs, who has no symbol, who is devoid of attributes, who is perpetual, who is sentient; who is present always and everywhere; who is the essence of all. Devotees who are purified by Him see the deity shining with His splendour and possessing massive refulgence: He has neither hands nor feet nor belly nor sides nor tongue: He is beyond the scope of the sense-organs. He is one and very subtle: Though He has no eyes, yet He sees; though He has no ears yet He hears. He has no intellect; yet there is nothing that He does not understand, He knows everything but none knows him: So they call him the great and foremost Purusa: The yogins who are in union with the deity see the Prakrti of all beings as acetana (insentient) subtle, all-pervasive and habitually giving birth to many effects.

She has hands and feet all round: She has eyes, heads and faces all round: She has ears all round. She stands enveloping everything in the world:

One who is endowed with yoga and knows the eternal Purusa, the lord of all living beings, never gets disillusioned. One who meditates on the unchanging; great and noble Brahman which is the soul of all living beings, and which is the greatest Atman; does not get disillusioned:

Just as the wind moving among all bodies is perceptible so also the Purusa. Because he lies down in the purusha he is called Purusa [puri sete]: He is too difficult to be grasped:

81. This verse is found in most of the Upanisads.

816. Purite teiti puruseh. puri_linga-trire, in the subtle body. Purusa is called because he is located in the subtle body.

with the immobile being: It should be known as Tamasa. The soul revolves there itself: The existence of Brahma, etc. is Sattvika worldly existence: The existence of embodied beings beginning with Brahma and ending with Pigaca should be known as existing in the heavenly abodes. The existence of Brahma is purely of the nature of Sattva, that of the immobile being is of the nature of Tamasa alone:

72-75. In the middle of the fourteen abodes, Rajas is that which impedes or fixes firmly even as the vital parts of the body of the embodied being who is in agony, are being cut and pierced: How can the brahmin then remember the greatest Brahman? The worldly existence is prompted by the impression and effects of the previous Dharma and accordingly human birth is achieved: Hence One shall practise meditation always. One shall realise that the zone of the worlds is of fourteen types and shall be frightened of it and begin to practise Dharma: Then, he changes and gradually crosses worldly existence. Hence, shall always be engaged in Yoga and interested in meditation. He shall meditate on the greatest being: He shall begin the practice of yoga that he gets the Atman within himself:

76. He is the waters: He is the greatest light: He is the excellent bridge: He is the cause of all living beings by means of evolution and combination. He is the permanent one: Hence; one shall worship Mahesvara the bridge; the Atman, the fire with faces all round; and stationed in the heart of all living beings. The devotee shall meditate on the lord who is stationed within who is embellished by his own Sakti who, for the sake of creation; is stationed in a series of eight different forms and who is stationed in the heart by compressing the fire: With the mind contemplating the fire stationed in the heart he shall perform five offerings. He shall drink pure water silently once (in the ritualistic way) in the squatting position. He shall utter "GPranaya Svaha".

After offering these severally with the utterance of Svaha, the devotee shall partake of the remaining offering as he pleases. He shall drink water once again and perform the rite of Acamana: After that he shall touch the heart:

85. He shall perform the rite of satiety with this mantra: "you are the knot of the vital airs." Rudra is Atman: Atman is the destroyer of the subjects Rudra, indeed, is the vital air of the Atman.

May the permanent lord of all the Universe be pleased. You are the eldest of all Devas. You are Rudra. Formerly you were Indra. You are soft by nature: May this sacrificial offering unto you be our food."

Thus, everything has been mentioned with special emphasis on the attainment of good attributes.

3. It is conducive to the rise of cleanliness. It is the excellent position of the sages. The sage who does not err in this does not come to grief.
4. Honour and dishonour are two things which call poison and nectar: Dishonour is nectar and honour is poison.
5. He, the disciple, shall live with the preceptor for a year engaged in the welfare of the preceptor: He shall always be unerring in the holy observances and restraints.
6. After obtaining his permission along with the excellent path of knowledge he shall walk over the earth (i.e. fulfill the duties of the mundane existence) without repugnance to Dharma.
7. One shall traverse the path sanctified by the eyes; one shall drink the water rendered pure by a cloth (i.e. well-filtered); one shall speak out words sanctified by truth; one shall practise those things that are purified by the mind.
8. If one drinks impure water for a day one incurs that sin which a fisherman incurs in the course of six months.
9. On drinking impure water one shall, as expiation, perform five hundred japas of Aghora mantra and then attain purity. Or he shall worship Siva with elaborate details, such as ablution with ghee, etc.

is thought that the yogin will be non-violent only in this manner,

1. The intelligent mendicant shall go in for alms to houses where all people have taken food but still there is plenty of fire without smoke. But he shall not go to the same house every day.
2. In that case people will insult him and the enemies will disgrace and humiliate him. So one shall beg for alms in the proper manner. He shall not defile the Dharma of good men.
3. One shall beg for alms in the houses of vagrant mendicants and in the houses situated in the forests. The latter shall be the better mode of sustenance.
4. O brahmins, thereafter he shall go in for alms at the places of humble householders who have faith, who have control over the sense-organs and who are noble-souled scholars of the Vedas.
5. Thereafter, he shall go in for alms in the houses of the non-defiled and not-fallen: The practice of begging for alms from people of other castes is considered the meanest of all modes. Any of the following things can be received in the form of alms, viz. gruel, butter milk, milk, barley water, ripe fruits and roots, bits of grains, oil-cakes and powdered fried grains.
6. The items of food mentioned by me are those that increase the accomplishments of the yogins. If they are realised the alms are said to be excellent: who begs for alms by means that are justifiable and the other who, (by way of penance) drinks a drop of water by means of the tip of the darbha grass once in a month, the former excels the latter.
7. Bhaikeya is so called because it removes the sins of one who is afraid of old age, death, rebirth, residence in hells; etc: addicted to the regular use of curds or milk or those who cause wastage in one who partakes of the alms: all these do not merit even sixteenth part of.

23. The rite of Candrayana shall be most excellent for all yogins. According to his capacity, the devotee shall perform it once, twice, thrice or four times:

24. Bhiksus (mendicants) have five vratas, viz: Asteya (non-stealing); Brahmacarya (celibacy); Alobha (non-covetousness); Tyaga (renunciation) and Ahimsa (non-violence) which is the greatest:

25. The niyamas (observances and restraints) are the following: akrodha (abstention from anger), gurusuSrusa (service to the preceptor), sauca (cleanliness), aharalaghava (lightness of food) and study of the Vedas regularly.

26. The qualities of the seed, the vagina and bondage with the objects are due to karmans (?); Just as in the case of the elephant in the forest so also in regard to men it is laid down.

27. All the sacrificial rites are equal to Devas. But japa is superior to sacrificial rites; perfect knowledge is superior to meditation; and meditation, devoid of attachment, is still superior to that: When that is acquired, the eternal goal is obtained:

28. Those persons whose intellects have been purified by perfect knowledge say that the following are auspicious qualities, viz: control of the mind, suppression of the sense-organs, truthfulness, state of being free from sins, silence; straightforwardness in regard to all living beings and the knowledge of those objects beyond the scope of the sense-organs: Only a noble soul who has concentration,

34. O sages of good holy rites, the brahmin and the preceptor are to be honoured by obeisance with eight limbs touching the ground with the following three set aside viz: head-dress, upper garment and footwear and with three circumambulations.

35. All elderly persons should be respected. If one wishes for excellent Siddhi one shall never break their behests.

For the expiation of great sins, one shall repeat Siva mantra in accordance with the injunction: If the sinner is, otherwise; of good conduct he is purified by half the number of japas. O sages of good holy rites, all the Upapatakins (those who commit subsidiary sins) get purified by half the number of japas: A brahmin guilty of the omission of Sandhya prayers becomes pure by repeating it thrice: If the daily routine is violated, it shall be repeated hundred and one times:

In yuga, the sustenance of people was from taking liquids; in Treta yuga from domestic trees. But this was discontinued during the subsequent ages. The same occurred in regard to the untimely intercourse, during the menstrual discharge, due to lust of men.

If approached on the twelfth night she will give birth to a son who is conversant with the principle of Dharma and who will observe the holy rites laid down in Srutis and Smrtis. If approached on the thirteenth night she will give birth to a sluggish girl who will bring about a mixture of castes. Hence, one shall assiduously avoid her on that night: If he approaches her on the fourteenth night she will be the mother of a son.

If approached on the fifteenth night she will give birth to a virtuous daughter; if approached on the sixteenth night she will give birth to a son who will be master of perfect knowledge:

If at the time of the sexual intercourse the air passes through the left side of the woman she will give birth to a daughter; if it passes through the right side she will give birth to a boy: The time of sexual intercourse shall be free from the influence of evil planets. At the time mentioned thus the husband shall remain clean and approach the pure and smiling wife joyously.

Thus, in the context of collecting together virtuous rites of the ascetics, the good conduct of all living beings has been recounted to you. Who reads this discourse on the good conduct or listens to it or narrates this to the brahmins who have destroyed their sins will attain the world of lord Brahma and rejoice along with the lord:

# CHAPTER NNETY

# The expialory rites of the ascetics

Suta said: Henceforth, I shall mention the mode of expiation by ascetics. This is recounted by Siva and it makes adequate atonement for the sins of ascetics.

2. Sins are of three types: those originating from speech, mind and body: It is by these that the universe is encompassed always, by day and by night.

3. Without activities the world cannot be sustained even for a moment, says the sacred Sruti. It is the only instrument that is conducive to longevity and sustenance.

4. It is only to the unerring that the yoga becomes accessible: Indeed, yoga is the greatest strength. There is no other auspicious thing for men that is greater than yoga.

5-7. Hence, learned men endowed with virtue praise yoga. They shall conquer (ignorance) by knowledge and attain excellent aisvarya. After seeing the greatest being inferior to none, the self-possessed ones will attain that region. There are main and subsidiary holy rites to be observed by the mendicants (Bhiksus). Expiatory rites are also laid down for violating any of them.

By carnally approaching a woman the mendicant incurs sin and for that the following expiatory rite is mentioned:

8. He shall perform Pranayama and observe the rite Santapana. Then with great concentration and attention at the end, he shall perform the Krcchrae rite in accordance with the direction: hermitage and

9-10. Again the Bhiksu shall return to perform the rite alertfully. Learned men say that a virtuous falsehood does not injure one. Still it should not be pursued. Its mere context is terrible. The expiatory rite is fasting for a night and a day—and a hundred Pranayamas.

845. santapanam - a rigid penance; cf, Manu; II. 213; also Mliliksard on Yajiavalkya (prayascitta)

846. ST. suppliei prajapatyam with krcchram: For detail, see P. 45 Note 62.

# The Expiatory Rites for the Ascetics

IL. Evil utterance and discussion shall not be pursued by an ascetic desirous of attaining Dharma. Thieving shall not be indulged in even when he is in great distress.

12-13. Sruti says that there is no evil greater than stealing: What is mentioned as "stealing" is a great violence that is inseparable from it: What is named "wealth" constitutes the external vital airs (Pranas). Hence, he who takes away the wealth of anyone really takes away the vital airs of that person.

14-15. A person who is wicked in mind becomes one who has transgressed the bounds of good conduct by doing so (i.e. by stealing). He becomes one who has fallen down from his holy rite. He shall repent for it again and again and perform the rite of Candrayana for a year in accordance with the injunctions laid down in scriptures: So says Sruti. At the end of the year he shall eliminate all his sins. The Bhiksu shall then alertfully repent and perform the rites.

16-17a. The Bhiksu shall abstain from injury to all living beings mentally, verbally and physically. If the Bhiksu injures animals and worms even unwittingly he shall perform the rite of Krcchratikrcchra or Candrayana.

17b-18a. On seeing a woman, if he has involuntary emission of semen due to his weakness, he shall observe sixteen pranayamas.

18b-19a. Now the expiatory rite for a brahmin who has seminal emission during the daytime is laid down. He shall observe fast for three nights and perform hundred pranayamas.

19b-20a. If he has nocturnal emission he shall take a clean bath and have twelve Dharanas. O brahmins, by means of the pranayama, one becomes a pure soul and free from sins.

20b-21. The following are forbidden foodstuffs for ascetics: alms from a single house every day, honey, wine, flesh (meat), uncooked food as well as salt itself: Expiatory rites are laid down for violating any one of these.

22-23. He is freed from that sin by the observance of Prajapatya and Krcchra. In regard to other transgressions, whether mental, verbal or physical, he shall consult good men and perform what they lay down.

847. Candrayana. See P. 45 note 61.

He shall sit facing the east or the north and perform the rite of acamana: He shall sit in the posture of Svastika and bow to MaheSvara. The body, the head and the neck shall be erect like a lamp in a windless spot: He shall be steady without flickering: He shall not look at anything else while practising Dharana (Retention).

40-43. The knower of scriptures shall practise yoga in the spot facing the north-east. He shall restrain lust, doubt, pleasure, happiness and misery mentally and only concentrate on clean meditation. He shall meditate on the nose, tongue, eyes, skin, ears and mind: He shall retain them in the intellect and chest: After realizing the time and actions he shall retain these parts of the body in the groups perpetually. This retention of the twelve parts of the body is called yogadharana. The man shall perform hundred or fifty such Dharanas on the head.

44-45. If he becomes exhausted due to the practice of Dharana, the wind begins to function upwards. He shall fill the body with the wind along with the Omkara. The yogin identifying himself with Omkara shall merge himself in imperishable being: He shall become imperishable thus: Henceforth, I shall mention the characteristics of the attainment of Omkara: having three Matras (units).

46. This should be known as the consonant in it is the deity: The first Matra is Vidyuti (pertaining to lightning). The second is Tamasi [having Tamo-Guna]:

47. The third is Nirguna (devoid of attributes). It covers up the imperishable Being: It should be known as Gandhari too, because it originates from the Gandhara note (the third of the seven primary notes of Indian Gamut).

48. When the Omkara that is uttered recedes to the head the devotee feels the touch of the moving ant;

49-52. The yogin identical with the Omkara becomes identical with the imperishable Being: Pranava is the bow, Atman is the arrow and Brahman is the target: It should be pierced by one who does not err. He shall be concentrated therein as in regard to the arrow. The single-syllabled word Om is hidden in.

# Lingopurana

The Omkara is identical with the three worlds, the three Vedas, the three sacrificial fires, the three steps of Visnu; the three scriptures, viz. Rk, Samans and Yajurmantras: It should be known that they are really the three and half Matras. The yogin who utters it attains identity with the deity:

53. The letter "A" should be known as Aksara (Imperishable) the letter "U" is then along with it Including the letter "M" Omkara becomes one with three Matras:

54. The letter "A" is the Bhurloka; the letter "U" is Bhuvarloka, the letter "M" is Svarloka:

55. The Om represents the three worlds. Its head is the Heaven: All the worlds constitute its limbs (body) Its feet are constituted by Brahmaloka.

56. Rudra's world is the foot of the Matra, Siva's region is devoid of Matras (i.e: above them) It is with this special knowledge that; that region is worshipped:

57. Hence, the devotee shall be interested in meditation: Indeed that imperishable Being devoid of Matras, should be assiduously worshipped by One who wishes for permanent happiness. The first Matra is short; the next long;

58-59. one is the third Matra is Pluta (prolated vowel). These Matras should be known in their proper order. They are to be retained only as long as it is possible:

60. He who always meditates on the sense-organs; mind and intellect in the Atman and listens to even half Matra shall attain its benefit:

61. Thanks to that Matra, one attains the merit which a person attains by a horse-sacrifice every month; for a hundred years.

62. Neither by a severe penance nor by plenty of gifts can that merit be obtained which is perfectly obtained by means of the Matra.

63. The householder yogins shall practice only that Matra which is taught as Pluta (Prolated Vowel) -

65. 0 brahmins, he who knows and realizes the Atman obtains everything: He shall be endowed with yoga. He shall be pure: He shall subdue the sense-organs. He shall control them.

66. Hence, the learned man shall contemplate the Atman by means of the yoga pertaining to Pasupati: Those who know the Atman are certainly pure beings.

67. It is through the knowledge of yoga that the brahmin, thinker on spiritual topics, attains the Rk, Saman, Yajur mantras, in fact all the Vedas and the Upanisads.

68. He becomes identical with all Devas and devoid of all elements. He gets rid of the necessity of passing through wombs and attains the perpetual region.

70. Where the obeisance to Rudra yields the benefits of all Karmans, one shall not attain those benefits through the obeisance to the other deities.

Or after seeing any evil portent and when the time of death has arrived the man shall go to Avimuktesvara in Varanasi and perform the expiatory rite: Somehow the man shall abandon his body there when, O leading brahmin, he is liberated: The man may abandon his body on the mountain, Sriparvata: No doubt need be entertained in this regard. Avimukta is a greatest shrine always bestowing salvation on the creatures: The intelligent man shall resort to it always: especially when death is imminent.

# CHAPTER NINETYTwo

# Glory of Srisaila

The sages said:

1-2. O suta of great intellect; if Varanasi is so meritorious it behoves you to recount its greatness to us now. We are eager to hear in detail the excellent greatness of this holy centre Avimukta.

Suta Said

3. I shall succinctly mention the glory of Avimukta, of Varanasi in the manner in which lord Bhava had narrated it:

4. O leading brahmins, even in hundreds and crores of years it cannot be mentioned in detail by me or by the noble Brahma:

5-6. Formerly, after his marriage, Sankara, Nilalohita started from the peak of the Himavan in the company of the goddess, the daughter of the Himavan, and the leading Ganas. After reaching Varanasi Sankara showed his Linga Avimuktesvara and began to stay there:

7-8. One can become an ascetic in Varanasi, Kuruksetra, Sriparvata, Mahalaya, Tungebvara, and Kedara. But if one performs the yoga of Pasupati perfectly for a day, one becomes an ascetic: Hence, one shall eschew everything and perform the Pasupata yoga.

9. One shall stay there in the garden of the Lord: There is an excellent garden of Sarva at that place: Rudra created mentally a splendid mansion also.

10. The lord accompanied by Nandin pointed out that divine excellent garden to the daughter of the Himavan:

11. Sankara Paramcs: Bhava mentioned to her the greatness of this holy centre Avimukta just for her pleasure:

12. The garden was rendered beautiful by the different clusters of trees in full bloom: It was very charming due to the spreading creepers, the Priyangu plants with growing flowers, and the Ketaka plants in full bloom though covered with thorns.

13. It was overspread with clusters of the Tamala trees: It was strewn with plenty of fragrant Bakula flowers all round: Hundreds of Asoka and Punnaga trees were in full bloom: Swarms of bees hovered round the flowers:

14. In some places the garden was resonant with the birds, Sarasas (Indian cranes), Cakravakas (Ruddy geese) and the intoxicated excellent Datyuhas (water-crows) all round: These birds were embellished by means of the pollen dust of the full-blown lotuses. They were chirping every moment:

15. In some places the excellent garden was resonant with the crowing sound of the peacocks; in some places it was resonant with the cackling sound of the Karandava ducks; in some places the garden was rendered noisy by the swarms of the inebriate bees accompanied by their bee-mates equally agitated due to intoxication:

16. It abounded in charming and fragrant flowers. In some places it was full of Sahakara (mango) trees with fresh sprouts; some places (in the garden) were hidden by Tilaka trees encircled by creepers: The Vidyadharas, Siddhas and Caranas sang in some places in the garden.

17. The garden contained groups of Apsarases engaged in dance: It was resorted to by different kinds of delighted birds. It was resonant with the sound of the Harita pigeons: It abounded in birds whose minds were excited due to the roaring sound of the lord of beasts.

18. In some places it abounded in flowers and sprouts of the Darbha grass plucked by the deer: In some places it was embellished by lakes and ponds abounding in different charming full-blown lotuses.

19. The garden was charming by the grace of the blue-necked peacocks hiding amidst the clusters of branches. It was resonant with the sounds emanating from the exuberant birds. The intoxicated bees lay hidden amidst the branches of the trees.

The trees in full bloom. The tall branches of those trees were rendered more splendid due to the lustre of the fresh sprouts.

20. In some places the beautiful creepers were chewed by the ladies of the Kimpurusa clan who walked in the garden in their elegant slow gait: In some places the beautiful trees were embraced by the creepers.

21. (?) The beautiful tops of the trees touched the clouds. The pigeons and doves sat on these tops and made a cooing noise: The tips of the trees had beautiful white forms that captivated the minds. The flowers that were scattered by these pigeons from tree tops disturbed the swans (in the lakes below): The garden was rendered charming by several groups of divine beings:

22. It contained a number of garden lakes with full-blown lilies and lotuses spreading far and wide and these brightened up the path leading to the shrine of lord Siva. The place was covered with different hedges and branches in combination with wonderful rows of flowers in the middle of the paths.

23. The borderlands of the garden were brightened up by charming Asoka trees with lofty tops and with their tall branches stooping down due to the weight of branches of the flowers. There were swings on either side of these trees and the songs of the birds resting therein caused pleasure to the ears. At night these trees in full bloom became indistinguishable from the Tilaka trees in bloom, thanks to the lustre of the moon: Herds of deer lay under the cool shade of the trees; some sleeping and some awake: Some of these deer had completely nibbled the tips of the Durva grass.

24. The clear waters of the lakes were spreading out due to the fluttering motion by the wind from the wings of swans. Flocks of peacocks danced elegantly on seeing the plantain trees on the banks of these lakes set in motion by the waters coming to their roots. The lands in some places appeared beautiful due to the feathers strewn on the ground from the tails of these peacocks. In these spots, inebriate pigeons and doves of the species called "Harita" lurked leisurely and rejoiced.

25. In some places the spots were beautified by the Saranga (flamingo) birds: Some places were covered with...

hcaps of Aowers of variegated colour: At other places the delighted Kinnara ladies played sweet songs on their lutes and danced. The trees thickly growing there harboured the residences of the sages beneath them; with flowers strewn around:

In some places the garden contained a lot of Jack trees, tall and spreading all round, with fruits growing from their very bottom. The garden looked charming and resonant with the sounds of the golden anklets of the Siddhas and the Siddha women resorting to the grottos of Atimuktaka creepers in full bloom. The bees eagerly hovered round the bunches of flowers of the charming Priyangu trees. Swarms of bees imbibed honey from the flowers of the mango and Kadamba trees.

The garden which bestows salvation on embodied beings looked charming with the water in the ponds gently shaken by the breeze and strewn with clusters of flowers. The fascinating hedges with bees humming therein beautified the garden: Herds of doves which got suddenly frightened by the gusts of wind took shelter within the thickets there:

The garden was heightened in beauty by the charming Tilaka trees as brindled as clusters of moon's rays; by the Asoka trees resembling saffron of the various types such as Sindura, Kunkuma and Kusumbha and by the Karikara trees having the lustre of gold. These trees had large spreading branches and were in full bloom with plenty of flowers.

The ground was covered with flowers of various colours: In some places they had the lustre of powdered collyrium; in some places they resembled coral and in other places they were like gold. Hundreds of birds chirped on the trees: The red Asoka trees bent down due to the weight of bunches of flowers. There were rest houses on the charming outskirts of the garden and they dispelled fatigue. The bees danced sportively on the full-blown lotuses:

Accompanied by the daughter of the mountain with snow-clad peaks, as well as by the friendly leaders of Ganas who were intoxicated, delighted, and well nourished with food, lord Siva, the ruler of all the worlds, thus pointed out the

extremely charming and extensive garden of trees of diverse kinds, to the goddess.

33. With divine ornaments evolved out of the most auspicious flowers of the forest; Siva decorated the divine goddess who was present in the garden: The daughter of the snow-capped mountain also devoutly embellished Siva the lord of Devas with divine flowers that were exceedingly auspicious and beautiful.

34. After seeing the extremely charming garden, after worshipping the lord worthy of being worshipped by the leaders of the gods and after bowing down to the lord who was accompanied by the leading Ganas; Nandin and others the goddess spoke to the lord:

The exalted goddess said:

35. O lord, the garden equipped with excessive lustre has been seen by me: It behoves you now to recount all the qualities of this holy centre.

36. O lord of Devas, O bull-emblemed lord it behoves you now to recount the glory of this holy centre, Avimukta in every respect:

Sqta said: hearing those excellent words of the goddess the lord of Devas smelt her lotus-like face: Then he laughingly spoke to her:

The lord said: 38. This extremely mysterious holy centre Varanasi is the hidden cause of the liberation of all creatures:

39. O fair lady, many Siddhas have adopted my Vrata in this holy centre: They have taken different types of Lingas and they always desire my world:

40-41. They are saintly souls one with the supreme spirit. They have conquered their sense-organs. They practise the greatest yoga in this garden abounding in different trees and birds and embellished by lakes abounding in lotus and lily flowers: This holy place is always resorted to by Aprarases and Gandharvas: evidence appeals me, listen: Once

42-43. Why this

Glory of Srifaila
whose mind is fixed in me, one who is devoted to me, one who has always dedicated his holy rites to me does not attain liberation anywhere else in the same manner as here: O fair lady, a creature that dies here becomes competent to attain salvation: This great and divine city of mine is the most mysterious of all mysterious places. Brahma, Siddhas and others who are desirous of liberation know this. The goal in me is the greatest one. Hence, this holy centre will never be abandoned by me nor has it been eschewed by me: This holy centre, therefore, is known as Avimukta.

Absolution is not obtained by taking dip in Naimisa, Kuruksetra, Gangadvaraese and Puskara nor by resorting to these. But it is obtained here. Hence, this excels all those holy centres.

Liberation may be achieved either at Prayaga or here, thanks to my adopting them: This Avimukta is more auspicious than even Prayaga which is the foremost of all holy centres:

Truthfulness is the esoteric principle underlying virtue; self-control is the esoteric principle underlying salvation: but excellent learned men do not know the esoteric principle underlying holy centres and sacred waters.

Taking food, sleeping, sporting and performing different activities as one pleases, one shall cast off one's vital airs in Avimukta. The creature is then competent to achieve liberation.

For men it is better to commit thousands of sins and court Pisacahood than to become Indra in thousands of births without resorting to the city of Kasi for achieving salvation. Hence; Avimukta should be resorted to.

It is here that Jaigicavya of great penance attained Siddhi. The excellent cave of Jaigisavya is purified, thanks to Avimukta.

who maintain holy rites and who have eschewed unholy ones

All these have their emotional attachment to me:

1. Resorting to me; all the intelligent persons devoid of attachment have attained salvation here due to my favour, lady of holy rites.
2. Thanks to my favour; O lady of holy rites, one attains salvation easily here itself which a yogin might attain in the course of thousand births.
3. This holy centre Gopreksaka has been formerly established by Brahma. O excellent lady, see the divine abode Kailasa here:
4. Going to Gopreksaka the man shall visit me here: Thereby, he avoids evil mishaps and is released forthwith from sins.
5. The great holy Tirtha named Kapilahrada has been made here by Brahma: This Tirtha, evolved out of the milk from the udders of cows, is extremely holy and sacred:
6. Here I am known as the bull-bannered lord: gentle lady, I am present here as seen by you.
7. See the deep pool of water here made by Brahma. It is named Bhadratoya (having auspicious waters). O gentle lady, I have been propitiated in this place by all Devas saying "Be subdued, O lord" and I became calm: I have been brought by Brahma Paramesthin and installed here:
8. I was seized by Visnu from Brahma and re-installed by him. Then Visnu was addressed by Brahma with a dejected mind. "This Linga has been brought by me; Wherefore have you installed it:"

10. My devotion to lord Rudra is extremely great and noble: Although the Linga has been installed by me it will be known after your name:

12. Thereafter, Brahma who was equipped with the greatest devotion once again duly installed this auspicious Linga of mine:

# Lingapurana

78. I am known here as Svarlinesvara (the lord who has merged into the heaven): I have come here voluntarily. A man who gives up his life here is not reborn anywhere:

79-80. That goal is not attained by any one else: It is what is known as the goal of yogins. In this place a haughty powerful Daitya who was a thorn to Devas, was killed by me after assuming the form of a tiger. I am perpetually settled here and am well known as Vyaghresvara (Tiger-Lord).

81-82. By visiting Vyaghresvara one will avoid courting disaster: There were two Daityas Utpala and Vidala who were, as ordained by Brahma previously, destined to be killed by a lady. They were therefore killed by you in a battle with a ball contemptuously thrown at them. Their bodies have occupied this place:

83. It was here that I came and settled at the outset with the leaders of the Ganas. Hence; this is the greatest abode of mine: Its vision is conducive to merit:

84. These Lingas have been installed all round by Devas: Hence; by visiting the lord in Lingas man shall invariably be a Gana when he dies.

85-86. Realising that this place is pleasing and beneficial to me, Linga has been established by your father Himavan, the king of mountains. It is known as Sailesvara. May this be seen with respect, O gentle lady, by visiting this no men shall court disaster or become wretched:

87. O gentle lady, this river Varuna is holy: It liberates one from sins. It embellishes this holy centre and becomes united with the Ganges by Brahma.

88. An excellent Linga has been installed at this confluence: It is known in the world as Sangamesvara (lord of the confluence). Become pure taking

89. If man shall take his bath at the confluence of the divine river and then worship Sangamesa, whence need he fear rebirth?

90. I consider this great holy centre as the exalted abode of the yogins: I am self-born in the centre of this holy spot occupying the acme of the same:

864. Utpela and Vidala - two Daityas who were killed by Siva.

865. Venupt - sacred river which joins the Ganga at Kali and hu

91-92. It is glorified by all Devas and Asuras as Madhyamaksvara (Lord of the centre). Indeed this is the abode of Siddhas who observe the holy rites pertaining to me. It is the abode of yogins desirous of salvation and of those who are interested in the path of knowledge. By visiting this Madhyamesana one will not bewail one's birth.

93-94. This Linga has been installed by Sukra the son of Bhrgu. It is named Sukresvara and is worshipped by all the Siddhas and immortal beings. By visiting this deity the man who has self-control is immediately liberated from all sins. The creature that dies here is not reborn in the world.

95-99. Formerly, an Asura who was a thorn to Devas assumed the form of a jackal. The jackal was not capable of being caught by others as he had acquired boons from Brahma. O daughter of Himavan, he was killed by me here and so I am called Jambukesa even today. I am known as such bowed to by Devas and Asuras. By visiting this lord of Devas one shall attain all cherished desires. These Lingas have been installed by the planets beginning with Sukra. See these sacred Lingas that bestow all cherished desires. Thus O Parvati, these sacred Lingas wherein I reside have been recounted. Listen to another esoteric secret of mine in this holy centre: This is glorified as extending to four Krosas in every direction.

100-101. O lady of charming features, this place extending to yojana bestows immortality after death. Know that by visiting me stationed in the Mahalaya mountain and in Kedara, one attains the state of being a Gana. Salvation is obtained in this place. That liberation is excellent since one attains the headship of Ganas.

102. O lady of excellent face, this Avimukta is known as the most sacred holy centre greater than even Mahalaye, Kedara and Madhyama.

103. These holy centres are sacred in the Bhurloka (earth) - viz. Kedara, Madhyama Ksetra and the holy spot Mahalaya: This Avimukta is more sacred than all these.

104. Ever since these worlds have been created, this auspicious holy centre has never been abandoned by me. Hence it became Avimukta (un-abandoned).

# Lingapurdza

By visiting the Linga named Avimuktesvara the man is immediately liberated from sins. He is liberated from the bondages of jiva:

# 106-108

By visiting all these holy centres, viz: Sailesa, Sangamesa, Svarlina, Madhyamcsvara, Hiranyagarbha, Gopreka, Vreadhvaja Upasanta Siva (?) the deity residing in Jyeethasthana, Sukresvara, Vyaghrcsa and Jambukcsvara man is not born again in the world which is the ocean of misery:

Sata said:

After saying thus, Mahadeva surveyed all the quarters.

# 109

When Mahesvara the lord of Devas stopped after surveying, that place suddenly became blazing as it were.

# 110-144

Then hundreds of Siddhas who were devotees of Pasupati, who were white by being bathed in ashes, who were great souls devoted to Mahesvara and who invariably observed holy rites came there and bowed down to Mahesvara. They then observed the lord of the yogas and adopted Dhyanayoga (path of meditation) assiduously: They took to the support of the Atman and stationed themselves as though they would merge into Mahesvara. Even as they stood by, the consort of Uma, the lord of Devas, the lord Purusa assumed the greatest of his physical forms. He stood as though towards the close of the worlds in order to make the entire universe present in one place: With hairs standing on their ends due to her delight, the daughter of the lord of the mountains could not look at the lord of the universe who had assumed the greatest of his physical forms.

# 115-148

Then she understood that that form which had not been seen before was stationed in Prakrti, and so Paramesvari adopted the form of the Prakrti by means of yoga: Then she could see the form of the noble soul: Then the yogins engaged in the meditation of merging (laya) entered the heart of the Purusa. They burnt all the seeds of mundane existence by remembering the splendid Bija of the five-syllabled Mantra: Then the Lord established his divine and holy form which dispels all sins and which had been revealed formerly in this Nilalhita image: daughter of the mountains.

had horripilation all over the body. She bowed down to his feet and culogised him. Then she said: "O lord, who are these?" Then the most excellent one among Devas spoke to the gentle lady, the daughter of the lord of the mountains. The lord said:

These are the best of brahmins who possess devotion to me and who resort to my vrata by practising all yogas that they have learnt: O beautiful lady, thanks to the greatness of this holy centre and their devotion to me; they are blessed by me through this physical form in the course of a single birth.

122-127 Hence; this great holy centre is resorted to by Brahma and others, by leading brahmins well-versed in the Vedic learning and by ascetics of great accomplishments. O goddess, the deity is worshipped at Varanasi on the eighth and fourteenth day in both the fortnights every month. It is particularly worshipped on solar and lunar eclipse days, especially in the month of Karttika, during all full moon and new moon days; and during equinoctial and solstitial transits. All the Tirthas of the earth resort to the holy Ganga flowing north at Varanasi, the Ganga that flowed out of my matted hairs, the Ganga that is the daughter of your father Himavan the king of mountains, the Ganga that is stationed in the holy abode and flows towards sacred quarters always. O lady of excellent face; what are these Tirthas? Listen.

128-133. These Tirthas accompanied by hundreds of Tirthas flow through Kuruksetra, Puskara, Naimisa, Prayaga where there is plenty of water; and Drumaksetra. O fair lady, they flow through all the holy centres all round: The deities, sages, Sandhyas, seasons, rivers, lakes, oceans and the divine Tirthas join Ganga during the Parvan days. O lady of good holy rites, O goddess of Devas; by visiting Avimuktesvara and Trivistapa and reaching Kalabhairava, the holy centre, men become rid of their sins during the Parvans. The sacred rivers of the earth and the great shrines and abodes enter Ganga at Varanasi in the course of holy Parvans.

134-139. The different shrines in and around this place are as follows: Avimukta is the most excellent holy centre: It dispels great sins. The Linga that is at Kedara,

Thus the mysterious secret has been revealed to you: Therefore, the creature that dies here attains the divine immortal region if he takes ablution in the Ganga and visits me, O auspicious lady. Immediately benefit.

The creature obtains equal to that of hundreds and thousands of sacrifices: What is more wonderful than that? O fair lady, of all the important shrines on the earth and on mountains, Avimukta is the greatest; Understand what has been said by me: The sin mentioned in the Vedas is recounted by Brahmins by the word SAvi. The holy centre is called Avimukta because it is free from Avi (i.e., sin) and resorted to by me.

After saying this, the lord of all said, "O goddess of Devas; Avimukta is my abode: See it well:" After saying this, the lord, the consort of Uma, pointed out the excellent Sriparvata to her: He stayed at Avimuktesvara permanently along with her. In view of his ability to go everywhere; the lord of Devas, the soul of all, identical with Sat and Asat came to Sriparvata along with the goddess: He, the lord of all living beings, pointed out to her the following holy centres and idols:

Kundiprabha; the great and divine Vaisravanesvara; Asalinge; Devesa; the divine Balesvara; the great Rames.

O unchanging lady, the holy Siddhavata is my perpetual residence: The divine splendid Ajabila is consecrated by Aja himself; there itself in my divine Bilesvara are my divine sandals. In the middle of the mountains Srngata is the idol Srngatakesvara installed by Sridevi. It is in the shape of Srngataka. Mallikarjuna is my splendid residence.

The shrine Rajesvara is installed in succession means of Rajas; the Gajesvara, the Vaisakha idol, the unchanging Kapotekvara; O fair lady, see now the splendid great Tirtha Kotisvara, which was formerly resorted to by crores of the Ganas of Rudra and which is superior to all the other shrines.

158. A splendid rocky idol was installed by Brahma in the south and another was installed in the north by Vienu: Both these together constitute the shrine called Dridevakula.

159. See, on the western mountain a Linga of huge size had been installed by me formerly. It is called Brahmesvara, Malesvara.

160. A shrine is remembered by the name Alamgrha: The lord said thus: "O Brahma, this has been embellished by you at the outset, along with the sages. After saying this he stayed in the house. Hence, the shrine came to be known as Alamgrha. lady conversant with the Tirthas, there is

borders of Devahrada. O fair lady, in the place where your necklace fell down in Harapura,978 the sacred pit of Harakunda has been made by You for the welfare of human beings. Lady of good holy rites, in Sivarudrapura, the idol Acalesvara has been installed by your father on the mountain.

165-169. Formerly, the Brahman was embellished by me along with the s38c8. O fair lady, the shrine Candikesvara is evolved by Candika. Candika is your daughter. This spot is the excellent Ambika Tirtha - splendid Dhars. The shrine Rucikesvara is here. This (current of water) is tawny-coloured: O fair lady, the devotee who worships me devoutly in these different holy centres and Tirthas, shall rejoice with me. The brahmin who abandons his body on Srisaila destroys all his sins. Undoubtedly he is liberated in the same splendid manner as in the holy centre Avimukta. O lady of good holy rites, he who duly performs the great holy rite of ablution named Mahasnana by means of ghee in these holy shrines and spots attains identity with me.

170-174. If the ablution is made with twenty-five Palas of the sacred material of worship it should be known as Abhyanga; if it is with hundred Palas, it should be known as Snana: Two thousand Palas of the material are said to constitute a Mahasnana (great ablution). The devotee bathes my Linga at the outset with cow's ghee: Then he consecrates it with the other materials: Thereafter he washes with water. The benefit of a hundred Yajmas is attained by the mere rite of wiping off the Linga; by bathing it the benefit of ten thousand sacrifices is attained; by worship the benefit of hundred thousand sacrifices is obtained: The benefit of those who sing and play on instruments of music is infinite: By means of the great bath eight times the benefit of bath is acquired. If the devotee wishes to perform the rite of ablution by means of water alone he shall do so by means of fragrant scented water with devotion. The unguent in every case is by means of twenty-five Palas of the material used.

175. The devotee shall use Sami flower, Bilva leaves and lotuses duly. He can use other flowers also but he shall not abandon the Bilva leaf:

176. He shall worship Mahadeva with four measures or eight Dronas of flowers etc. The Naivedya (food offering) shall be ten Dronas or eight Dronas.

177. If the devotee is a brahmin devoid of wealth, he attains the same benefit and merit as with the worship of a hundred Dropas even when he worships only with an Adhaka measure. No doubt need be entertained in this respect:

178-184. The devotee shall keep awake during the night by playing on various musical instruments such as Bheri, Mrdanga, Muraja, Timira, Pataha, etc. He shall effect other types of sounds too. He shall duly pray: Accompanied by his servants, sons, wife, relatives and kinsmen he shall circumambulate the excellent Linga and pray thus:

"0 lord of Devas, 0 Sankara, it behoves you to forgive all my sins: Forgive me if my worship is devoid of the requisite materials, faith and rites."

After saying this he shall immediately perform the Japa of Tvarita Rudra and other Santi mantras: He shall then repeat the Bija of the five-syllabled mantra. He attains the same benefit as is obtained by visiting the holy centres and performing the sacrifices: He attains the same goal as one who dies in Varanasi: Similarly, he shall undoubtedly attain Sayujya (identity with me). For the sake of propitiating me, these rites should be performed duly by my devotees: If they neglect, certainly they are not my devotees.

Sita said: On hearing these words, the goddess went to Varanasi. She bathed the Linga Avimuktesvara with milk and ghee: She worshipped Rudra the lord of Devas; the leader of the worlds. On the Mandara mountain (?) in Avimukta she propitiated the great Atman by means of penance. She built a shrine on the Mandara that has beautiful caves: It was here that the lord blessed the great daitya Andhaka, the son of Hiranyaksha. Sportively he blessed him with the offer of Gana-hood:

Thus the entire story has been recounted to you in detail.

# CHAPTER NNETYTHREE

# The Narrative of the Asura Andhaka

The sages said: How did the leading Daitya named Andhaka obtain the chieftaincy of the Ganas from Mahesvara after being subdued in the Mandara mountain with many charming caves? It behoves you to recount it in the manner it happened and in the way you have heard:

Sita said: I shall succinctly mention how Andhaka was blessed; how he was desiccated on the Mandara mountain and how he attained boons. I shall mention everything briefly: Formerly a son was born to Hiranyaksa. He was comparable to Hiranyanayana (i.e. his father in prowess). He was well known as Andhaka: By means of penance he attained great prowess. Thanks to the grace of Brahma, he attained immunity from death. He enjoyed the whole of the three worlds. Formerly, he conquered the city of Indra sportively and terrified Indra without any strain:

All Devas, Narayana and others were oppressed, beaten, bound and struck down by him. They became frightened and entered Mandara:

After afflicting Devas thus, Andhaka the great Asura happened to come casually to the mountain Mandara with charming caves: leading Devas including Sadhyas, then all those approached Mahesa, the lord of all Devas and said thus: We have been split and pierced by the weapons of Andhaka, the king of Daityas: We are of very little virility. Hence; we are quickly struck and split in every limb. Daitya on hearing thus of the arrival of the through his leading Ganas the lord set out against Andhaka. At that

place, Indra, the lotus-born Brahma, Vigpu and other leading Devas and the excellent brahmins shouted victories to the lord from all sides: They kept their joined palms on their crown to show their reverence.

11-13. Reducing the entire host of the Asuras to ashes in crores and hundreds of crores, Mahadeva pierced Andhaka with his trident: On seeing that Andhaka was pierced and that his coat of mail of sin had been burnt; Brahma shouted in joy after bowing down to Isa. On hearing that shout Devas bowed down to the lord and shouted: The sages danced. The Ganas rejoiced.

14. Then Devas showered plenty of flowers on lord Siva. The whole of the three worlds rejoiced with delight and shouted:

15. Transfixed to the trident and burned like a dead body in fire the demon assumed Sattvika emotions and thought thus in his mind.

16-19. 'Previously, lord Mahesvara had been propitiated by me in the previous birth since I have been burned now by Siva. Hence; this has come to pass. Otherwise, this does not fit in. He who remembers Rudra even once in his mind at the time of death attains identity with him. Why not then he who remembers many times. Brahma, Visnu, and Devas including Indra seek refuge in him. One shall certainly seek refuge in him alone: After thinking thus, Andhaka, delighted in his mind; eulogised Siva, Isana who had suppressed him: It was due to the weightiness of his merit that Andhaka could eulogise thus.

20-21. On being prayed to by him, lord Siva, the lord of Devas, the dispeller of dejection; said to Andhaka the son of Hiranyanetra, who was fixed to the tip of the trident. Glancing at the Danava, the lord spoke with mercy.

22. So dear one, I am delighted with you: Welfare unto you. What cherished desire of yours shall I fulfill: O leading Daitya, O Andhaka, choose the boons. I am known as the bestower of boons:

29. On hearing the words of the lord, the son of nayana spoke thus to Mahesvara in words choked within, due to excess of delight:

24. O lord: O Sankara, the dispeller of the agony of your

devotees, 0 lord of the chiefs of Deves; crave for your devotion if a boon is to be given unto me: 0 Isa, be pleased.

25-26. On hearing the words of Andhaka, the great Atman, Bhava of great lustre granted him pure devotion which is difficult of access. He conferred on him the chieftaincy of the Ganas. The leading Devas and others bowed down to him who had been thus established in the position as the chieftain of the Ganas.

# CHAPTER NNETYFOUR

# Uplifting the Earth

The sages said: father the terrible demon Hiranyakea,

1-2. How was his slain by Viepu? How did Visnu assume the form of Boar? How did his horn attain the status of an ornament of Mahesa? O Suta, it behoves you to narrate all this to us in detail.

Suta said:

3. The brother of Hiranyakasipu is known as Hiranyaksa: He was comparable to Kala the destroyer. He was the father of Andhaka the lord of the Asuras:

4. This leading Daitya defeated all Devas. He bound the earth that has the lustre of blue lotus and took it to Nether regions. He made it his prisoner.

5-8. Devas including Brahma were oppressed, struck and bound by this cruel leader of the Daityas, Hiranyakya, the strong and wicked soul. Their facial splendour became faded: They bowed down their heads to Visnu who formerly had suppressed crores of Daityas. They submitted to him the news about the imprisonment of the earth: On hearing this; Lord Visnu assumed the form of Yajaavarha as at the time of the manifestation of the Linga. With the tip of his curved fang he killed Hirapyakta the leading Daitya of great strength.

Uplifting the Earth
killing him along with other Daityas; the lord the slayer of the Daityas shone splendidly:

1. Just as in the beginning of kalpas before; he entered the Nether regions and brought the earth out of the ocean and made her seated on his lap: Then Brahma, the best of Devas, accompanied by Indra and others eulogised Visnu the lord of Devas with words choked with great emotion.
2. Obeisance to the perpetual Varaha with the curved fangs and the staff: Obeisance to Narayana who is identical with all. Obeisance to Brahman the greatest Atman: Obeisance to the maker of all. Obeisance to the holder of the earth. Obeisance to the slayer of the enemies of Devas. Obeisance to the creator and leader of the chiefs of Devas and the chastiser of all. You are Astamurti (having eight cosmic bodies). You have infinite forms. You are the primordial Deva: You are known as Ananta (Eternal Being). Everything has been created by you, O lord of Devas, be pleased, O lord of the worlds, O Varaha, O Visnu: O Visnu the fulfiller of our desires; all the important Daityas were killed in a trice by you with half of a hundred millionth part of the tip of one of your curved fangs, along with their sons and servants.
3. O lord of earth, the earth was lifted up by you and held at the tip of your curved fangs; O lord, having the lustre of clouds, O lotus-faced God, served by all the people, all the mountains, all the oceans, and by all Devas and Asuras:
4. O lord, it was by you alone that the victory of the Devas was brought about: Ha! a boon has been given; the goddess of speech has been bestowed on the lotus-born deity, O lord, be pleased.
5. All the leading immortal beings find a place in your hairs; the moon and the sun in your eyes; the earth that had been taken to the nether worlds was placed at the pair of your feet; All the constellations find a place on your back:
6. O lord, O preceptor of the universe, the earth that had been taken to the cavity of the nether regions, has been uplifted by you without the help of any army, for the welfare of the worlds: Everything has been held by you alone.
7. Thus, the lord of speech, Prajapati, bowed to Vignu along with Devas repeating different hymns and WON -

shipping him in different ways. From Visnu he obtained different boons: He was himself having the body originating from the umbilical lotus of Visnu.

20. Devas and the leading sages received on their heads the earth that had been uplifted by him. In the presence of the discus-bearing lord they kept the earth on their heads and bowed down to him:

21-22. "0 earth, 0 bestower of boons, You have been redeemed by this Varaha alone, by Krena, by Vienu who has hundreds of hands and whose activities are not strained. 0 earth, you are highly blessed. 0 unchanging one, you are an extensive being: 0 earth, you are the supporter of all the worlds. Dispel our sins.

23. 0 lotus-eyed bestower of boons, it is by your favour that we live after our sins have been destroyed by you, mentally, verbally and physically.

24-26a. On being thus addressed by Devas the earth said: "0 brahmins, he who keeps on his head the pinch of earth broken by the curved fangs of Varaha, repeating this Mantra, shall be liberated from sins. He shall be long-lived and strong: He shall be blessed with sons and grandsons. After leaving the earth he reaches heaven and rejoices along with Devas. At the end of his Karman he returns to the earth.

26b-27. When Varaha the lord had gone back to milk Ocean after leaving off the form of the boar, the earth shook again. The curved fangs of intelligent lord of Devas, pressed down by the weight of the earth fell down there:

28-32. Bhava, the lord of the universe; who casually went that way, saw that curved fang and took it up for his own embellishment: Mahadeva kept it on his head as well as on his chest: Devas including Indra eulogised Bhava, the lord of Devas: was thus stabilised sportingly by the lord of Devas during dissolution. If the lord had not thus decorated himself with parts of Visnu, Brahma and other Devas sportingly how could the brahmins attain salvation: Hence, Mahesvara wears curved fang (Dametra) as his ornament.

The Exploits of Nrsimha the Man-lion
# CHAPTER NINETYFIVE

# The Exploits of Nrsimha the Man-lion

The sages said

1. It is heard that HiranyakaSipu the elder brother of Hiranyaksa was formerly killed by Nrsimha. How was he killed by him, kindly tell us?

Sita said:

2. The son of Hiranyakasipu was known by the name Prahlada. He was conversant with virtue endowed with truthfulness, asceticism and intelligence:

3-4. Ever since his birth he devoutly worshipped the unchanging omniscient Visnu who is lord of Devas, who is omnipresent, who is the cause of origin of all Devas, who is the primordial Purusa, who has the form of Brahman, who is the overlord of Brahma and who is the cause of creation, sustenance and annihilation.

5-6. The enemy of Devas saw that his son was frequently repeating "O Govinda, Obeisance to Narayana." He observed that his son was devoted to Visnu: The demon of sinful intellect looked at his son as though he would burn him and said:

7-8. "O heroic Prahlada, O my wicked son, I am the cause of agony to the brahmins as well as Devas. Who is Visnu? Who is lotus-born (Brahma)? Who is Indra, Varuna, Vayu, Soma (Moon), Isana or Pavaka (Fire) to be considered equal to me? Worship me alone with devotion and never the insignificant Narayana."

9-12. "O Prahlada, listen to me if you have any desire to be alive." Even after hearing the threatening words of Hiranyakasipu, the intelligent boy Prahlada worshipped Vignu and uttered "O Narayana, obeisance to you, Obeisance to Narayana." He taught all the Daityaboys the same excellent Brahmavidya. Hiranyakasipu saw that his command had been transgressed by his son, the command that could not be transgressed even.

by Indra and others

On knowing that his behest had been violated Hirapyakasipu said to Danavas: *It behoves you to kill this wicked son of mine who is worthy of being put to death in various ways:*

Thus ordered by the heart; Danavas hit and struck the undaunted Prahlada who considered himself a servant of the lord of Devas:

O excellent brahmins, what had been evilly perpetrated then by those Asuras on the son of the king of Daityas became futile; thanks to the brilliance of the lord who lies down in the milk ocean.

In order to kill Hiranyakasipu who was furious due to his haughtiness, the lord assumed the form of the man-lion and manifested himself there itself: Glancing at the son kindly he hit the father the base Danava. At the very same moment he split him with his sharp claws:

Then, the dispeller of sins killed that Daitya with his kinsmen. Like fire of annihilation at the close of yugas he harassed the leading Daitya.

O brahmins of good holy rites, the entire universe became terrified due to the terrible roar of Nrsimha: All the worlds beginning with the world of Brahma trembled:

On seeing Nrsimha, Devas, Asuras, Nagas, Siddhas, Sadhyas, Vayu, Brahma and others left off their courage and strength and went off in different directions in order to protect their lives. When they had gone, the lord Nrsimha who had a thousand shapes, who had all feet and all arms; who had thousand eyes; whose three eyes were the moon, sun and fire, who was the wielder of Maya remained there enveloping everything. The excellent Devas who were stationed on the Lokaloka accompanied by Brahma, Siddhas, Yama and the Maruts, culogised him:

You are the Brahman that is greater than the greatest: You are the greatest of realities. You are the greatest splendour among all luminaries. You are the greatest Atman: You are identical with the universe:

You are gross and subtle; nay the subtlest: You are the auspicious being identical with Sabdabrahman: You are beyond

1. You are the partaker of sacrifices of sacrificers: You are the lord bestowing fruits on those who perform sacrifices: You assume the form of a fish. You are stationed in the universe after assuming the form of a tortoise.
2. You have assumed the forms of the Boar and the lion for saving the kingdom of Devas by killing the lord of Daityas:
3. Under the pretext of the curse of brahmin (i.e: Bhrgu) you sportingly incarnated on the earth: Nothing is seen distinctly different from you: You are the whole universe consisting of the mobile and immobile beings.
4. You are Visnu, Rudra, and Brahma. You are the beginning and the end; O lord, you alone are we.
5. You alone are the universe: O lord; of what avail is mere prattling: O lord, that which is non-dualistic is stationed in manifold ways; due to Maya.

How shall we eulogise you? O lord of the pasus, lord of Devas, how you shine!

Although the lord was thus eulogised with different hymns, with emotional feelings, O brahmins, the lord did not become calm because he was honouring the species in which he manifested himself (i.e a lion).

He who reads this hymn pertaining to the Man-lion, or he who ponders over its meaning or he who narrates this to the brahmins, is honoured in the world of Vienu:

In the meantime, Devas including Indra and Brahma came to lord Siva and eulogised him after informing him about the activities of Visnu who assumed the form of beast (Lion): Then Brahma and others eulogised Paramesvara. They sought refuge in him who is the great cause, for saving their souls: Accompanied by Devas and extremely afraid; Brahma eulogised Paramesvara Mahadeva who was staying on the Mandara mountain sporting with Uma and who was served by...

O Sarva, Vispu the maker of the universe has assumed the form of Nrsirha: For the welfare of the worlds that lord himself has killed Hiranyakasipu with his sharp claws along with many leading Daityas. But being in the lconine form he is harassing the universe:

O lord of Devas, kindly do what should be done in the matter.

55. You are Ugra (fierce) you are the restrainer of all wicked ones you are our benefactor: Protect us through your bodies of Kalakuta, etc: We have sought refuge in you:

56-58. O lord of the universe, your conduct is spotless we are but tools of your game: Our dissolution and rise depend upon the closing or opening of your eyes. Even when you are wide awake, O lord, we are distressed by Vienu of unmeasured splendour. O Siva, our destruction cannot happen when you are wide awake: It behoves you to curb and check Nrsimha, for the welfare of the worlds:

Seta said

The lord who was thus addressed by them replied smilingly.

59-63. The lord offered them fearlessness saying "I shall kill him:" Indra bowed to the lord along with Devas. Lord Brahma and Devas returned to their homes. Soon after Mahadeva assumed the form of a Sarabha and approached the haughty Man-lion. The lord in the form of Sarabha took away his life and was worshipped by Devas. From the form of a lion Visnu assumed his original form and went away gradually: The lord too who was thus eulogised by Devas went away:
