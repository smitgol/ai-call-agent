# CHAPTER ONE

(The marriage of Himdcala)

N&#x26;rada said: —

1. O Brahma, how did the goddess Sati, the daughter of Daksa who forsook her body in her father’s sacrifice, become the daughter of Himacala, and the mother of the universe?
2. How could she secure Siva as her husband after performing a severe penance? Please explain this clearly to me who ask you about it.

Brahma said:

O foremost of sages, listen to the story of Siva which is excellent, sanctifying, highly divine, auspicious and destructive of all sins.
When the great goddess Sati, the daughter of Daksa, was sporting about on the Himalayas with Siva, Mena, the beloved of Himacala thought that she was her own daughter and loved her like a mother with all kinds of nourishments.
When the great Goddess Sati, the daughter of Daksa who had been to her father’s sacrifice and who did not receive his due attention became angry and cast off her body, at the very same time, O sage, Himacala’s beloved Mena wanted to propitiate her in Sivaloka.

I- Himavat or Himacala is represented in two forms (i) the mobile and (2) immobile. The former is the subtle human form while the latter is the gross, stationary form identical with the mountain Himalayas. The present section recounts the marriage of Himavat with Mena in his mobile form. See RS III I. i

2. Mena or Menaka, the wife of Himavat and the mother of Parvati, was one of the three daughters of Svadhis, the wife of Kavi, a class of Pitrs. Svadhis was one of the sixty daughters of Daksa and Pravati who gave birth to Mena, DhanyA and Kalavati.

# Sivapurina</h8>
8. Sati thought to herself: —“I shall be her daughter” and cast off her body in order to become the daughter of Himacala.

9. At the proper time Sati who had cast off her body and who was worshipped and eulogised by the gods became the daughter of Mena out of sheer joy.

10. On being advised by Narada, the goddess who was named Parvati, performed a severe penance and thereby secured Siva as her husband. Narada said:

11. O Brahma, of great intellect and foremost of eloquent gods, please tell me the origin and details of the marriage of Mena.

12. Blessed indeed is the gentle lady Menaka of whom Sati was born as a daughter. Hence that chaste lady is worthy of the honour and blessings of everyone.

Brahma said:

13. O sage Narada, you listen to the story of the origin of Parvati’s mother and her marriage and other details both sanctifying and conducive to the growth of devotion. O excellent sage, there in the northern region

14. is a mountain called Himavat who is the lord of mountains and has great splendour and prosperity.

15. His twofold aspects—that of a mobile nature and that of the immobile one—are well known. I succinctly describe his subtle form.

16. He is beautiful and is the storehouse of multifarious gems. Extending from the eastern to the western ocean he appears like a measuring rod of the Earth.

17. He abounds in various trees. Being of variegated shape and features he is adorned by many peaks on him. Lions, tigers and other animals frequent it. Many happy persons live there for ever.

18. He is the storehouse of snow (and yet) very fierce. He is the resort of wonderful things. He is resorted to by

the gods, sages and seers. He is a great favourite of Siva.

19. He is of pure soul, an abode of austerities. He sanctifies even the great souls. He is the bestower of the benefit of austerities. He is the auspicious storehouse of multifarious minerals.

20. He is of a divine form. He is beautiful in every part. He is the unaffected part of Vi?nu. He is the king of leading mountains and a great favourite of the good.

21. Due to the desire for the benefit of the manes and the gods and for the stabilisation of his race as well as for the increase of virtue, Himacala wanted to marry.

22. OAt that time, considering their own interest entirely, excellent sage, the gods approached the celestial forefathers and said lovingly to them.

The gods said:

23. “O ye forefathers, listen to our words with pleasure. If you desire that the affairs of the gods be fulfilled you must act accordingly soon.

24-25. Uniting your eldest daughter Mena of auspicious features with Himacala, a great benefit will accrue to everyone. At every step, the miseries of the gods and those of yours as well can be reduced.”

Brahma said:

26. On hearing these words of the gods, pondering over them and remembering the curse incurred by their daughters, the forefathers said “Amen” to their proposals.

27. They gave their daughter Mena to Himavat. In that auspicious marriage there were great festivities.

28. Vi$nu, the other gods and the sages reached there with their hearts set on Siva.

29. Giving many charitable gifts they made the celebration a great success. They praised the celestial forefathers and the Himavat.

30. All the gods and the sages rejoiced and returned to their own abodes with their hearts set on Siva.

31. After receiving many articles as gifts and

marrying the beloved lady Mena, the lord of mountains returned to his abode and rejoiced. Brahma said:

32. O excellent sage, the pleasing details of the splendid marriage of Himavat with Mena have been recounted to you thus. What more do you wish to hear?

# CHAPTER TWO

(Mend and others incur the imprecation of Sanaka etc.)

Ndrada said:

1. O Brahma, the intelligent one, please now tell me reverently about the origin of Mena as well as the imprecation. Please clear my doubts.

Brahmd said:

2. O Narada and the sages, listen to the narrative of the origin of Mena. O excellent son, O great scholar, I shall mention it now.

3. O sage, I have already told you about my son Daksa. He had sixty daughters all of whom were the instruments of creation.

4. He celebrated their marriages with KaSyapa and other bridegrooms. You know all that already. O Narada, now, listen to the present story.

5. Among those, the daughter Svadha was given to the forefathers. She had three daughters all of whom were of handsome features and virtuous forms.

6. O excellent sage, listen to their holy names which remove obstacles and confer blessings.

7. Mena was the eldest. Dhanya was the middle. Kalavatl was the youngest. All these were mentally conceived daughters of the forefathers.

8. They were not born of the womb of Svadha. They were conventionally considered her children. On reciting their names, men can achieve their desires.

9. The mothers of the worlds are worthy of reverence of the entire universe always. They are the bestowers of great joy. They are great yoginls, storehouses of knowledge. They pervade the three worlds.

10. O excellent sage, once the three sisters went to Svetadvipa (white island)4 in the world of Viṣṇu for sight-seeing purpose.

11. After bowing to and eulogising Viṣṇu with great devotion they halted there at his bidding. A great concourse of people was held there.

12. O sage, at the same time, Siddhas, sons of Brahma Sanaka and others came there. They bowed to and lauded Viṣṇu and stayed there at his bidding.

13. On seeing those sages Sanaka and others and the persons who had assembled there, stood up. When they, the elders of gods respected by the people, sat they all bowed to them.

14. Helpless by misfortune and deluded by lord Siva’s illusion O sage, the three sisters did not stand up.

15. Siva’s illusion is weighty and capable of deluding the worlds. The entire universe is subservient to it. It is also called Siva’s Will.

16. The same is also called an action that has begun to fructify. Its names are many. Everything takes place on Siva’s wish. There is nothing to be pondered over in this respect.

17. Becoming a victim thereof, the sisters did not make obeisance to them. They remained surprised and stunned thereafter seeing them.

18. On seeing such a behaviour on their part the great sages, Sanaka and others, despite being wise, became unbearably furious.

19. Himself deluded by Siva’s illusion Sanaka, a perfect Yogin, furiously told them giving a curse as punishment.

Sanatkumāra said:

20. Inspite of being the daughters of the forefathers,

4. It has not been possible to identify this island. Colonel Wilford attempted to identify it with Britain. See. H. M. P. 315.

# SivapurSna

ye three sisters are foolish, bereft of wisdom and ignorant of the essence of the Vedas.

21. You did not stand up nor did you pay any respects to us. You were haughty and deluded and so evinced a deluded disposition of human beings. Heilce all of you shall leave heaven.

22. May the three sisters deluded by ignorance be born as human womenfolk. May ye reap this fruit as a result of the power of your own action.

Brahmd said:

23. On hearing this, the chaste maidens got perplexed. The three fell at his feet and spoke with their heads bent down.

The daughters of the forefathers said:

24. “O excellent sage, ocean of mercy, be pleased now. Because we were mentally confounded we did not bow to you.

25. O Brahmin, the result thereof has been achieved by us. Great sage it is not your fault. Bless us now whereby we shall regain heavenly abode again.”

Brahmd said:

26. On hearing their words, O dear, the sage spoke to them. He had been induced by Siva’s illusion to give them redemption from the curse. He was a bit consoled.

Sanatkumdra said:

27. “O ye three daughters of forefathers, listen with pleasure to my words that will dispel your sorrow and bestow happiness on you.

28. May the eldest among you become the wife of Himavat the mountain that is a part of Visnu. Parvati shall be her daughter.

29. The second daughter Dhanya shall be the YoginI, the wife of Janaka. Her daughter shall be MahalaksmJ in the name of Sita.

30. The youngest KaUvatl shall be the wife of the Vaiiya—Vr?abhana. At the end of Dvipara, R&#x26;dhi shall be

her daughter.

1. The Yogini Mena shall attain the great region Kailisa along with her body and in the company of her husband due to the boon of Parvati.
2. Janaka shall be blessed by Sita born in Janaka’s race and he shall be a living liberated soul. A great Yogin, he will attain Vaikuntha.
3. Kalavati by the virtue of Vrsabhana shall become a living liberated soul and attain Goloka along with her daughter. There is no doubt about it.
4. Without adversity how can one attain greatness? To persons of good rites, if misery vanishes happiness is likely to be difficult of access.
5. Ye the daughters of forefathers shall shine in heaven. By the vision of Visnu your evil actions have been quelled.
6. After saying this, the sage was freed of his fury on thinking of Siva, the bestower of wisdom, worldly pleasures and salvation.
7. Listen further to my words always pleasing to you. You are all blessed by Siva's pleasure. Hence you will be worthy of honour and respect immediately.
8. Mena's daughter, goddess Parvati, the mother of the universe shall become Siva’s beloved after performing severe penance.
9. Dhanya’s daughter Sita will become Rama’s wife. Based on worldly conventions she will sport about with Rama.
10. Kalavati’s daughter Radha, resident of Goloka shall become the wife of Krishna united with him in secret love.

Brahma said

After saying this, that holy sage Sanatkumara vanished there itself along with his brothers after he was eulogised duly.
The three sisters, the mentally conceived daughters of the forefathers were freed of their sins and attained happiness. They returned to their residence quickly.

Goloka is a modern addition to the original series of fourteen lota. It is identified with Gokula, a pastoral district on the Yamuna about Mithuri where Krishna passed his boyhood with the cowherd.

# CHAPTER THREE

(Hymn to Siva by Vijnu and other gods)

Narada said:

1. O Brahma, the best of eloquent ones, of great wisdom, please tell me. What is the subsequent story of the good auspicious mountain?
2. You have narrated the wonderful story of the auspicious antecedents of Mena. The details of the marital rites too are heard. Please continue the subsequent narrative.
3. After marrying Mena what did the mountain do afterwards? How was Parvati, the mother of the universe, born of her?
4. How did she secure Siva as her husband after performing a severe penance? Narrate all these things in detail regarding the glory of Siva.

Brahma said:

O sage, lovingly listen to the auspicious glory of Siva on hearing which even a slayer of a brahmin becomes pure and attains all desires.
O Narada, there was great pomp and ceremony in the three worlds when Himacala returned to his abode after marrying Mena.
The delighted Himacala too celebrated a great festival. With good intention he worshipped and revered brahmins, kinsmen and others.
The contented brahmins returned to their respective abodes after blessing them. The kinsmen and the others also returned.
The delighted Himacala sported with Mena in his cosy abode, Nandana and other parks as well as in several nice places.
At that time, O sage, Visnu, the gods and the noble-souled sages approached the mountain.
On seeing the gods after their arrival, the noble

# Rudrasarhhitd

Himacala bowed to them gladly and honoured them with devotion. He praised his own good fortune.

12. With the head bent down and palms joined in reverence, he eulogised them with great devotion. Himacala’s hair stood on end and tears of love fell from his eyes.

13. O sage, after bowing to them, the delighted Himacala spoke thus to Visnu and other gods. Himacala said:

14. Today my life has become fruitful. My good penance has become fruitful. Today my knowledge has become fruitful. Today my sacred rites have become fruitful.

15. I have become blessed today. My entire kingdom, my wife and family have become blessed. Everything has become blessed. There is no doubt about it.

16. Wherefore have all of you come in a body? Lovingly command me, considering me your own servant.

Brahma said:

17. On hearing these words of Himacala, Visnu and other gods considered their affair fulfilled and were delighted. They spoke.

Gods said:

18. “O Himacala of great intellect, please listen to our beneficent words. We shall gladly tell you why we have come.

19. O Himacala, the mother of the universe Uma, who was born as Daksa’s daughter, became Rudra’s wife and sported for a long time on the earth.

20. On being disrespected by her father, Sati remembered her vow, abandoned her body and returned to her own region. O Himacala, story well known in the world.

21-22. You too know it. If this takes place it will be an asset to all gods as well as to you. The gods too will be under your control.”

Brahma said:

23. On hearing these words of Visnu and others...

# Sivapvr&#x26;na

delighted lord Himacala said— “So be it” and worshipped them with respect.

24. After instructing him in the method to be followed with great devotion they approached Uma, the consort of Siva.

25. They stationed themselves in a good place and remembered the mother of the universe, and bowing to her repeatedly eulogised her with devotion. The gods said:

26. O goddess Uma, mother of the universe, resident of Sivaloka, favourite of Siva, O great goddess, O Durga, we bow to you,

27. With great devotion we bow to the illustrious Energy, the holy, the tranquil, the holy nourishment and the one with the forms of Mahat and the Avyakta.

28. We worship you, Siva the cause of welfare, the pure, the gross, the subtle, the great goal and the one delighted with the inner and good learning.

29. You are faith, fortitude and prosperity. You alone have control over everything; you are the splendour and energy of the sun illuminating your own universe.

30. We bow to her who promotes robustness in all the beings of the universe from Brahma to a blade of grass in the whole Cosmos.

31. You are Gayatrl, the mother of the Vedas, Savitrl, Sarasvati, the sustenance of all the universe; you are the triad of the Vedas having Dharma for its form.

32. You are sleep in all living beings; you are hunger, satiety, thirst, splendour, brilliance and contentment. You are the delightcr of every one for ever.

33. To those who perform meritorious actions you are the goddess of fortune. To the sinners you are the eldest sister, the deity of Ignominy; you are peace for the universe, and the mother sustaining lives.

34. You are the essential feature of five elements. You are Justice in those who uphold justice. You are endeavour personified.

35. Of the Rgveda you are the invocation; of the Yajurveda you are the blending knot of the mantras; of



---


Rudrasarhhitd 485

Samaveda you arc the song and of the Atharvana Veda you are the measure of time, you are the final goal.

36. She who is the Tamasika power of all the Gods, she who is visible in the Rajasika quality of the Creator, she who is heard by us as the benefactress and of the form of Siva is eulogised here.

37. Let us bow to her who is interested in residing on the Vindhya mountains; who is clever in the playful activity of affording protection to Asfariga Yoga; who is devoid of cessation and who acts like a raft that enables the crossing of the ocean of worldly existence with its terrible miseries.

38. May she be pleased with us, for keeping up the sustenance of the world, she, who in the form of slumber that is extremely exhilarating to all born in the universe, extends pleasure in the nose, eyes, face, arms, chest and the mind.

Brahma said:

39. Thus eulogising the great Goddess Sail, the mother of the universe, all of them stood waiting lovingly desirous of seeing her.

# CHAPTER FOUR

# (The Goddess consoles the Gods)

Brahma said:

1. Thus eulogised by the Gods, the Goddess Durga, the mother of the universe, the destroyer of impassable distress, appeared in front of them.

2. She was seated in a wonderful divine gem-set chariot over which a soft cushion had been spread and which was decorated with tinkling ornaments.

3. She was shining with the brilliance of her limbs that surpassed even the lustre of a crore of suns. She was sur-

# Sivapurdna

rounded by a halo created by her own lustre. She was of symmetrical splendour.

4 She was the unequalled supreme illusion, the beautiful wife of Sadasiva. She had all the three qualities and was devoid of attributes also, she had been staying in the region of Siva.

5. She was the mother of the three deities, CanqU Siva, the destroyer of the distress of all, the mother of all supreme slumber and the redeemer of all her own people.

6. Siva was seen by the gods through the power of huge column of brilliance. Again the gods eulogised her in order to have a sight of her.

7. Then Vi$nu and other gods who were desirous of seeing her saw the mother of the universe there itself after receiving her favour.

8. The dwellers of heaven were extremely pleased, they bowed to her again and again and particularly eulogised her.

The gods said:

9. O Siva, O great Goddess, O mother of the universe we gods bow to you, the destroyer of all distress.

10. O Goddess, neither the Vedas nor the sacred texts know you perfectly. Your greatness, O Siva, is beyond the scope of speech and mind and cannot even be meditated upon.

11. Even the Vedas mention you, trembling with fright, by negating what you are not. What will be the matter in regard to others?

12. Many devotees know the same after getting your favour through devotion. There is no cause for fear to the devotees who seek refuge in you.

13. O great Goddess listen to our submission which we, your slaves for ever, are going to explain.

8 As the personified energy of the gods Visnu, Brahma and Rudra, representing the three qualities Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, the Goddess is called ‘Trigutj&#x26;’ i.e. possessed of three qualities. But as the personified energy of Siva, who is the Supreme Being, devoid of attributes she is called NirguiiA.

9 She is the mother goddess of Vifnu, Brahmi and Rudra, the synthetic form of three qualities responsible for the creation, maintenance and dissolution of the universe.

# Rudrasarhhita

14. Formerly you were born as the daughter of Daksa and were married to Siva. You destroyed the great misery of Brahma and others.

15. Being disrespected by your father, you cast off your body in accordance with your vow. You then went to your own world and Siva became miserable.

16. O great Goddess, the purpose of the gods has not been completely carried out. The sages are agitated. Hence we, Gods, have sought refuge in you.

17. O great Goddess, please fulfil the desire of the God, Siva, so that the words of Sanatkumara may be fruitful.

18. O Goddess, incarnating again on the earth please be the wife of Rudra (Siva) again. Carry on your sports in a fitting manner and let the Gods be happy.

19. O Goddess, may Rudra too, the resident of Kailasa be happy. Let all become happy. Let misery perish entirely.

Brahma said:

20. Saying so, Visnu and the other gods, full of loving devotion remained waiting silently and humbly.

21-22. Siva too was delighted on hearing the eulogy of the gods and ascertaining the course of the same after remembering her lord Siva, the compassionate Uma addressed smilingly the gods, chief of whom was Visnu. The Goddess, favourably disposed to her devotees, said:

Uma said:

23. O Visnu, O Brahma, O Gods and sages who are free from sorrow and pain ye listen to my words. I am delighted undoubtedly.

24. My activities are conducive to happiness everywhere in the three worlds. The delusion of Daksa and other things were carried out by me alone.

25. I shall take a full incarnation on the earth. There is no doubt in this. There are many reasons for the same. I shall mention them with respect.

26. Formerly, O gods, with great devotion Himacala and Mena rendered service to me in my life as Sati, like my parents.

27. Even now they continuously render me service and



---


# SivapurSpa

Mena particularly (does so). There is no doubt about my becoming their daughter.

# 28.

Just as you, Rudra too, desires my incarnation in the abode of Himavat. Hence I shall incarnate. That shall be the end of misery in the world.

# 29.

All of you return to your abodes. You shall be happy for a long time. After incarnating I shall give Mena full happiness.

# 30.

I shall become Siva's wife. But this desire is a great secret with me. Siva’s divine sport is wonderful. It deludes even the wise.

# 31-32.

Ever since I cast off my body born of Daksa on seeing my lord’s disrespect at the hands of my father at the altar of sacrifice, my lord Rudra is tormented by thoughts about me.

# 33-34.

He saw my anger at the altar of my father’s sacrifice. Thinking that the virtuous lady had cast-off her body out of love for him he became a Yogin and abandoned home-life. He assumed an unearthly form and features. But he could not bear my separation.

# 35.

On account of me he was much distressed. He put on an abnormal dress. Ever since he forsook the excellent pleasure of love.

# 36.

Hear further, Vi$nu, Brahma, sages and gods, the divine sports of the supreme lord Siva, that protect the universe.

# 37.

Oppressed by the pangs of bereavement He wreathed a garland of my bones. Although He is the sole enlightened god He did not get peace anywhere.

# 38.

Like a non-god, like a helpless creature he roamed about here and there and cried aloud. The lord Himself could not distinguish between the proper and the improper.

# 39.

The lord Siva did this just to show the behaviour of a love-lorn lover. He blabbered like a lover in despair due to separation.

# 40.

But really the supreme lord has no aberrations, is not distressed and remains unconquered. My master Siva is perfect, lord of all and the controller of illusion.

# 41.

He is not tarnished by illusion. Of what avail are illusion, love and other emotions for Him?

Rudrasamhita 489

42. Rudra, the lord, is anxious to marry me and hence my incarnation on the Earth at the residence of Mena and Himacala, O gods.

43. In order to propitiate Rudra, I shall incarnate as the daughter of Mena, the wife of Himacala, in accordance with the way of the world.

44. After performing a severe penance as His devotee I shall become Rudra’s beloved and then perform the work of the gods. This is truth, real truth, there is no doubt about it.

45. All of you return to your abodes. Continuously worship Siva. Undoubtedly your miseries will be quelled by His favour.

46. By the grace of merciful lord Siva, you will achieve auspicious results. As the wife of that lord I shall be honoured and worshipped in the world.

Brahma said:

47. O dear, even as the gods were watching, Siva, the mother of the universe, vanished after saying this and returned immediately to her world.

48. After making obeisance to the direction in which she went, the delighted Visnu and others, sages and the gods, returned to their abodes.

49. O excellent sages, thus I have narrated to you the auspicious narrative of the goddess Durga. It is always pleasing to men and it bestows worldly pleasures and salvation.

50. Whoever hears or recites this with concentration, reads or teaches this, will obtain the fruits of all desires.

# CHAPTER FIVE

# (Mend obtains the boon)

Narada said:

1. When the Goddess Durga vanished and the gods returned to their abodes, what happened next?



---


# Sivapurdna

O dear, how did Mena and the lord of the mountains perform the great penance? How did he beget a daughter of Mena? Please narrate.

Brahma said:

# 2.

O best of brahmins, O most excellent of my sons, listen to that great account. After bowing to Siva with devotion I shall narrate that story which increases devotion.

# 3.

When Visnu and other gods returned after instructing him, the lord of the mountains and Mena performed a great penance.

# 4.

Meditating on Siva and Siva day and night with devout mind, the couple worshipped them continuously.

# 5.

The beloved of the mountain worshipped the goddess along with Siva, joyously. She gave charitable gifts always to the brahmins for their satisfaction.

# 6.

Desirous of obtaining a child, she worshipped Siva everyday for twenty-seven years beginning it in the month of March-April.

# 7.

Observing a fast on the eighth day of the lunar fortnight, she made charitable gifts of sweets, offerings of oblation rice cakes, puddings and fragrant flowers on the ninth day.

# 8.

She made clay idol of the Goddess and worshipped her by offering various things on the banks of the Ganga in Ausadhiprastha.

# 9.

On some days she observed a complete fast. On some days she observed sacred rites. Some days wind alone constituted her food and some days she drank only water.

# 10.

With her mind fixed on Siva, Mena passed twenty-seven years with pleasure and brilliant lustre.

# 11.

At the end of twenty-seven years, Uma the beloved of Siva, the mother of the world and identical with the universe became highly delighted.

# 12.

The goddess Siva, delighted by her good devotion appeared in front of Mena in order to bless her.

# 13.

Appearing to her in a form of divine limbs through a lustrous zone, she smilingly said to Mena.

It was the capital of Himavat. Cf. Kilidiia’s Kumftra 6. 33,36. The name indicates that it was a market place for the mountainous herbs.

# Rudrasamhitd

The Goddess said:

15. O beloved of the mountain, I am delighted by your penance. O chaste lady, tell me what you desire in your mind.

16. O Mena, whatever is desired by you by penance, sacred rites and ecstatic contemplation I shall grant you and that too whenever you wish for it.

17. Then seeing the goddess in her presence Mena bowed and spoke these words:

Mena said:

18. O Goddess, your form has been perceived by me directly, just now. I wish to eulogise you. Be pleased.

Brahma said:

19. On being thus requested by Mena, the goddess Umii, the enchantress of everyone, embraced Mena and was highly delighted.

20. Acquiring very great wisdom, Mena eulogised Siva, who had appeared in person, by means of pleasing words with great devotion.

Mena said:

21. I bow to the great goddess, the bestower of all desires, I bow to her who wields great illusion, the creator and sustainer of the universe.

22. I bow to her of contemplative sleep, and to her the wielder of great illusion and the cause of permanent bliss. I bow to the mother of the universe. I bow to Siddha having the garland of auspicious lotuses.

23. I bow to the grandmother, of perpetual bliss. I bow to the goddess who dispels the sorrow of the devotees.

ii. The Goddess Siva is mentioned here under a variety of names, forms, attributes and actions. She is contemplated upon by the ascetics for the deliverance from the bondage of this world. She is propitiated for the satiation of desires with the bloody sacrifices performed according to Atharvanic rites. In her milder form, she is represented as pleasing as the moon, gracious as the mother. In her terrible aspect, she is furious as the fire and scorching as the sun.

who is a model for all women and who constitutes the intellect of all living beings.

24. You are the caust of the snapping of all fetters of ascetics. Which one of your powers can be sung by women like me? You are violence mentioned in the Atharvaveda. You (of such powerful means) fulfil my desire.

25. The living beings are being united to the different principles of the nature of permanence and otherwise and those without substance are discarded. You are the inherent power of those permanent principles. In the proper time you become a woman of ability with Yogic powers.

26. You are the origin and the sustainer of the worlds. You are the eternal Prakrti, the great, by whom even the Brahman is brought under control. O you, of noble nature, O mother, be pleased with me.

27. You are the great power latent in fire; you are the burning power of the sun’s rays; you are the pleasing power of the extensive moonlight. O Goddess, I bow to you.

28. To good women you manifest yourself as their beloved; to persons of perfect self-control and sublimation you manifest yourself as eternal; to the entire universe you manifest as desire; as of Visnu you are the Maya so you are of Siva.

29. You assume different forms as you please for the purpose of creation, sustenance and annihilation and give birth to the bodies of Brahma, Visnu and Siva. You, of such potentiality, be pleased. Obeisance to you again.

Brahma said:

30. Thus eulogised, the goddess spoke to Mena desiring her to choose a boon.

Umd said:

31. O Himacala’s beloved, you are as favourite to me as my vital air. Whatever you desire I shall give you. There is nothing that I can withhold from you.

32. On hearing these nectar-like words of the Goddess, the delighted Mena, the wife of Himacala, said.

Mend said:

33. O Siva, Hail, Hail! O great goddess, If you consider me worthy of a boon, I shall choose one.

34. O mother of the universe, at first let me have a hundred sons endowed with longevity, heroism, prosperity and accomplishments.

35. After that let me have a daughter of comely features and good qualities who will delight both the families and who will be revered by the three worlds.

36. O Siva, be my daughter for fulfilling the needs of the gods. O Goddess, be Rudra’s wife and indulge in divine sports with the lord.

Brahma said:

37. On hearing the words of Mena, the delighted goddess spoke smilingly, fulfilling her desire.

The Goddess said:

38. May hundred heroic sons be born to you. One of them very strong will be born at first.

39. I shall be born as your daughter since I am delighted by your devotion. Since I have been served by the gods I shall fulfil their desire and carry out their activities.

Brahma said:

40. Saying so, the Goddess Siva vanished from there even as Mena was watching.

41. O dear one, on getting the desired boon from the Goddess, Mena attained immeasurable joy. Her misery occasioned by penance vanished.

42. Bowing down in that direction, the chaste lady of delighted mind returned to her abode repeating the benedictory word “JayaM (be victorious).

43. She told her husband about the boon, which had already been understood by him through good omens, by her words which were rendered useless.

44. On hearing the words of Mena, the lord of mountains became delighted. He praised his wife who was devoted to Siva lovingly.

45. O sagr, when their mutual sexual intercourse took

Sivapurdna place, Mena conceived and the child in the womb gradually grew up.

46-48. She gave birth to a beautiful son Mainaka who later on became the worthy recipient of the love of Naga ladies and who later on entered into an alliance with the lord of ocean. O celestial sage, when Indra, the slayer of Vrtra, became angry and began to chop off the wings of mountains, he retained his wings, nay, he did not even feel the pain of being wounded by the thunderbolt. He had good limbs. He had neat strength and prowess. He was the most important of all the mountains born of him. He too became the lord of mountains.

49. In the city of Himacala there was a wonderful celebration of the event. The couple were highly delighted. Their pain was at an end.

50. He gave monetary gifts and charitable offerings to brahmins. Their devotion to Siva and Siva became increased.

# CHAPTER SIX

# (PdrvatVs birth)

Brahma said:

1. Then the couple, with great devotion remembered the goddess for her birth in order to carry out the work of the gods.

2. Then the Goddess who formerly had cast off her body to spite her father, by means of her Yogic powers, desired to be born of the wife of the mountain.

3. In order to make her own words true, the great goddess, who bestows everything desired, delightedly entered the mind of the mountain with all her constituent elements.

4. Hence he shone with an extraordinary splendour.

12. Mainftka, the son of Menakit and Himavat, is represented as the most valiant of a hundred sons of his parents. When Indra clipped the wings of the mountains he is said to have been the only one who escaped. He is placed near the southern sea between India and Ceylon, for the present text glorifies his friendship with the ocean. Cf a bo Skanda J\ VI g. jo-ii ‘Wlainakab Sumudraniah.

and great joy. With a resplendent brilliance, he, of lofty mind, became invincible like a blazing fire.

# 3.

Then, in a beneficent hour, the lord of the mountains deposited in his beloved the entire constituent element of Siva by means of ecstatic contemplation.

# 6.

The wife of the mountain, by the grace of the goddess who had sympathetically stationed herself in the mind of the mountain, conceived.

# 7.

The beloved of the mountain, Mena, shone all the more by the presence of the goddess who bore the entire universe. She appeared as if she was in a brilliant sphere.

# 8.

Mena bore the characteristic signs of pregnancy which almost indicated the imminent rise in pleasure of her lord and served as the auspicious cause for the future bliss of the gods.

# 9.

The weakness of her body did not allow her to wear ornaments. Her face became pale like the Lodhra flower. She resembled the night when there are very few stars and the moon is in a waning state.

# 10.

Kissing her face, emitting the fragrance of the earth in the course of his secret dalliance, the lord of the mountains, was not satiated. His love increased.

# 11.

The lord of mountains asked Mena’s friends frequently — “What are the desires of Mena? She herself does not express them out of bashfulness.”

# 12.

Whatever product of the mountain she wished to have in the course of her pregnancy she found brought to her. There was nothing which he, the lord of the mountain could not accomplish in the heaven too.

# 13.

Surmounting the difficulties of the early days of pregnancy, she grew more plump in her limbs. Mena then shone like a tender creeper putting forth more leaves and flowers.

# 14.

The lord of the mountains considered his pregnant queen like the earth with a treasure within and like the Sar.nl twig with latent fire in it.

15. The intelligent lord of mountains performed all the sacred rites befitting his love for his wife, the loftiness of his mind, the vastness of riches earned by him and the injunctions of the Vedas.

16-17. At the proper time, he saw his wife Mena about to be delivered of the child, with delight, as one sees the sky enveloped with clouds. The lord of the mountains felt greatly rejoiced on seeing his wife of sound and auspicious limbs in the “labour-chamber” presided over by physicians. She felt very brilliant with the mother of the universe in her womb. In the mean time, O sage, Visnu, and other gods as well as the sages came there and eulogised Siva who was in the womb.

18. The gods said: — O Goddess, be victorious, O intelligent one, mother of the universe, O great Goddess, O you of true rites, prone to truth, true in three things, O truth-formed.

19. O you stationed in truth, we have sought refuge in you. O you delighted with truth, Origin of truth, Truth of Truth, of truthful sight.

20. O beloved of Siva, great goddess, O destroyer of the miseries of gods, you are the mother of the three worlds, consort of Siva, pervasive and favourably disposed to your devotees. O goddess of the manifest three worlds, yourself and perform the function of the gods. O goddess, all of us are well protected only due to your favour.

21. Happy persons attain their happiness only from you. Nothing shines in the three worlds without you.

Brahma said:

22. Thus eulogising, in many ways, the great goddess stationed in the womb, the gods returned to their abodes, highly delighted in their minds.

23. When nine months were completed, in the tenth month, the goddess, the mother of the universe, bore all the states of a child in the womb in the complete form.

24. The time was good. The planets, stars and the

luminary heavenly bodies were quiet; the sky was clear and there was brilliance in all the quarters.

27. The earth consisting of forests, villages and oceans was very auspicious. Lotuses blossomed in lakes, rivers and tanks.

28. O excellent sage, diverse winds gentle to the touch blew; good men rejoiced and bad people became unhappy.

29. The gods stood in the sky and sounded big drums. A shower of flowers fell. Excellent Gandharvas sang sweet songs.

30. Vidyadhara women and the celestial nymphs danced in the sky; in the heavenly region great festivities were celebrated by the gods and others.

31. At that time Siva, Sati of perfect power formerly appeared in front of Mena in her real form.

32. She was born at midnight when the constellation MrgaSiras was in conjunction with the moon on the ninth day in the month of Madhu (March-April) in the spring season like the Gariga from the moon’s sphere.

33. Coming out of the belly of Mena at the proper time in her real form, she resembled LaksmI coming out of the ocean.

34. When she was born, Siva was glad. A slow, fragrant and auspicious wind blew favourably.

35. Along with the rain there was a shower of flowers. Fires calmly glowed and the clouds rumbled.

36. At the time of her birth, riches and prosperity flourished in the city of Himavat. All miseries perished.

37. Visnu and other gods reached there in time and saw the mother of the universe. They were delighted and

38. They eulogised Siva the mother of the universe, the beloved of Siva, of great illusory power, of divine features and resident of Siva’s region.

The Gods said:

39. O great goddess, O mother of the universe, O achiever of all accomplishments, you alone can carry out the work of the gods. Hence we bow to you always.

40. O you favourably disposed to the devotees, do

everything conducive to the happiness of the Gods. You have fulfilled the desire of Mena. Now, you fulfil that of Siva.

Brahma said:

1. After eulogising Siva thus, Visnu and other gods bowed to her again delightedly and returned to their abodes praising her great divine ways.
2. O Narada, Mena rejoiced much on seeing goddess Uma of the splendour of the blue lotus as her daughter.
3. On seeing her divine features, the beloved of the mountain attained perfect knowledge. After that realisation she eulogised the supreme Goddess with very great delight.

Mena said:

“Great favour has been shown by you, O Goddess, O mother of the universe, inasmuch as you have manifested yourself in front of me brilliantly.
You are the primordial one among all Energies. O Siva, you are the mother of the three worlds. O Goddess you are the beloved of Siva, you are the great goddess eulogised by the gods.
O great Goddess, be pleased. Remain in my meditation in this form, but have the form of my daughter in public view.”

Brahma said:

On hearing these words of Mena, the wife of the mountain, the delighted goddess Siva replied to Mena, the beloved of the mountain thus.

The Goddess said:

“O Mena, formerly you served me excellently. I am delighted by your devotion. I have come near you to grant you a boon.
On hearing my words “Express your wish and choose a boon” you had chosen the boon “great Goddess, become my daughter. Do what is beneficent to the gods.”
Accordingly granting you the boon I returned to

my abode. O beloved of the mountain, I have become your daughter at the proper time.

51. I have assumed the divine form now, so that you may be reminded of me. In a human form if I had appeared, it would have put you out of knowledge about me.

52. Constantly thinking of me in the form of your daughter, or in the divine form with love, both of you will surely attain my region, the great goal.

53. I shall do the work of the gods showing my wonderfully divine sports. I shall become the wife of Siva and redeem good men.”

Brahma said:

54. After saying thus Siva kept quiet. Even as the mother was watching with pleasure, she assumed the body of a daughter by her power of illusion.

# CHAPTER SEVEN

# (The childhood spoits of Parvati)

Brahma said: —

1. The goddess of great brilliance assumed the form of her baby child in front of Mena and began to cry in accordance with the ways of the world.

2. On account of her splendour that diffused all round the lying-in-couch, the midnight lamps that burnt in the lying-in-chamber were rendered dim in a trice, O sage.

3. The women in the house were extremly glad on hearing the gentle cry of the child. In their excited flutter and great pleasure they rushed in.

4. The superintendent of the harem immediately informed the king about the birth of Parvati which was pleasant and conducive to the work of the gods.

5. To the superintendent of the harem who brought the news, there was nothing which the king could not give even including his royal white umbrella.

500 mins, the lord of mountains came there and saw the child who shone in her lovely clothes.

7. The lord of mountains rejoiced on seeing the child shining in dark splendour like that of the blue lotus.

8. All the citizens there, both men and women, rejoiced much. There were great festivities. Different sorts of musical instruments were played.

9. Auspicious songs were sung. The dancing girls exhibited their saltatorial skill. The lord of mountains performed post-natal sacred rites and made charitable gifts to the brahmins.

10. Himavat came to the outer gate of the palace and joined the festivities. With a delighted mind he distributed monetary gifts to the beggars.

11. In an auspicious hour, in the company of the sages, Himavat named his daughter Kali and assigned other pleasing names to her.

12. He gave charitable gifts to the brahmins out of love and respect. Varieties of festivities were gone through with suitable music.

13. Though he had many sons, the lord of mountain and his wife rejoiced more on seeing Kali frequently, after these celebrations.

14. There in the palace of the lord of mountains the goddess Siva grew up like Ganga in the rainy season and like the moon-light in the autumn.

15. The goddess Kali of exquisite body and comely appearance acquired more and more splendour like the disk of the moon acquiring more and more digits day by day.

16. The child was fondly attached to every member of the family, Hence the kinsmen called her Parvati, a name befitting her family. The girl had all the qualities of good conduct and behaviour.

17. Afterwards when Kali wanted to perform penance she was forbidden by her mother who said “O, no(U ma). Hence O sage, the sweetfaced lady came to be called Uma in the world.

18-19. Although he had many sons, the eyes of the mountain were never satiated on seeing the child Parvati endowed with good fortune. In the spring season there may be many.

20. The mountain Himalaya was both embellished and sanctified by his daughter like a learned man by his speech of grammatical purity.

Just as a lamp in the house is praised by leaping flames of brilliance, just as the path of the good by the Ganga, so also the lord of mountains was respected on account of Parvatl.

22. During her childhood, the goddess played frequently on the sandy banks of the Ganga in the middle of her playmates with balls and dolls.

23. O sage, the goddess Siva when the suitable time for her education arrived learnt all the lores from a good preceptor, with concentrated mind and great pleasure.

24. Just as the flock of swans returns to the Ganga in the autumnal season and just as the brilliant lustre manifests itself in the medicinal herbs during the night, so also all the learning of the previous birth returned to Kali.

25. O sage, thus I have described one of the divine sports of Siva. I shall narrate another one of her divine sports. You listen to it lovingly.

# (Ndrada-Himalaya Conversation)

Brahma said:

1. Once, induced by Siva, you went to the abode of Himacala lovingly, you who have the knowledge of Siva and who are the foremost among those who know the divine sports of Siva.

2. O sage Narada, on seeing you, the lord of the mountains bowed to you and worshipped you. He called his daughter and asked her to fall at your feet.

3. O excellent sage, he bowed to you again. Himavat joined his palms in reverence and bent his head considering it his duty and spoke to you.

O sage Narada, of good knowledge, O lord, foremost among the sons of Brahma, you are omniscient. You are sympathetic. You are engaged in rendering help to others.

# 5.

Please read the horoscope of my daughter and tell me about her good and bad fortune. Whose beloved wife will my fortunate daughter be?

Brahma said: —

# 6-7.

O excellent sage, being thus requested by Himavat the lord of mountains, you looked at Kali's palm and the limbs as well. O dear, you are wise. You know many facts. You are eloquent in speech. You then spoke.

Narada said:

# 8.

“O Mena, O king of mountains, this daughter of yours has all auspicious signs. Like the first digit of the moon she will increase day by day.

# 9.

She will delight her husband, and heighten the glory of her parents. She will be a great chaste lady. She will grant bliss to everyone always.

# 10.

I see all good signs in the palm of your daughter, lord of mountains. There is an abnormal line also. Listen to the indication thereof.

# 11.

Her husband will be a naked Yogin, without any qualities. He will be free from lust. He will have neither mother nor father. He will be indifferent to honours. His dress and manners will be inauspicious.

Brahma said: —

# 12.

On hearing your words the couple thought them true. Both Mena and Himavat were much distressed.

# 13.

O sage, on hearing your words, and inferring that indications referred to Siva, Parvati’s joy knew no bounds.

# 14.

Convinced that Narada's words could not be false, Siva turned her mind and love to Siva’s feet.

# 15.

The lord of mountains who was very much grieved in mind spoke to you, “O Narada, O sage, what is the way out? What shall I do? A great misery has befallen us.”

16. On hearing that, O sage, you who are eloquent in speech, delighted Himavat by your sweet words of auspicious import and spoke to console him.

N&#x26;rada said: —

17. “O lord of mountains, listen to my words with affability. They are true. They cannot be false. The lines in the palm are the lines of Brahma. They cannot be untrue.

18. O lord of mountains, there is no doubt that her husband will be such a person. You now hear what you have to do whereby you will be happy.

19. There is a bridegroom like that. He is lord Siva who has sportively assumed a physical form. In Him all bad characteristics are equal to good characteristics.

20. In a majestic person a defect does not produce misery. It may well cause misery in a non-majestic person. Sun, fire and Gahga may be cited as examples.

21. Hence you give your daughter in marriage to Siva. That will be a wise step. Lord Siva who is the sole lord, unchanging and without any aberration is worthy of being resorted to.

22. By performing penance, Siva can be propitiated quickly and He will accept her undoubtedly.

23. In every respect, Siva, the lord of all, is the most suitable person. He cannot be slain even by thunderbolts. He can render Brahma and others distressed.”

24. O dear sage, after saying this you continued. You delighted him with auspicious words. You spoke to the king of the mountains.

25. “O lord of mountains, she will be the wife of Siva and will remain his favourite always. She will be a chaste lady of good rites. She will increase the pleasure of her parents.

26. Performing a penance she will fascinate Siva’s mind towards herself. He too will marry none else except her.

17. Our translation is based on the following emended text:

A love akin to this pair will not be found anywhere. Never in the past was it seen nor will it occur in future. Nor it is current now.

# 28.

O best of mountains, the two will fulfil the work of the gods. They will resuscitate those who have breathed their last.

# 29.

O lord of mountains, Siva will become Ardhana-ri$vara (half male and half female), with your daughter forming half the part of your body. Their meeting once again will be delightful.

# 30.

After propitiating lord Siva, the lord of all, by the power of her penance, your daughter will take away half the body of Siva.

# 31.

By propitiating Siva with her penance she will acquire the lustre of gold and will be known as Svarnagauri. Your daughter will be as fair-complexioned as lightning.

# 32.

This girl will be famous in the name of Gauri. She will deserve the respect of Vi$nu, Brahma and the other Gods.

# 33.

O mountain, you shall give her to anyone else. This is a secret of the gods. This shall not be revealed to anyone else.

# 34.

O celestial sage, Narada, on hearing these words that you spoke O, sage, the eloquent Himavat spoke thus:

Himavat said: —

# 35.

O sage Narada, O intelligent one, I have one submission to make. Please listen to it lovingly and make us delightful.

# 36.

It is heard that the great God abhors all attachments. He has perfect self-control. He is ever busy in penance and is out of reach of even the Gods.

# 37.

O celestial sage, He is in the path of meditation. How can He withdraw His mind from the supreme Brahman? I have a great doubt in this respect.

# 38-39.

The supreme Brahman is great and imperishable. It is like the streak of a lamp. It is termed Sadasiva. It is without aberration. It is beyond Brahma. It is both full.

40. O sage, from the Kinnaras who come here, such are the things heard about Him. Can it be untrue?

41. This is also heard that Siva had entered into a contract with the lady Sati. Listen to what I say?

42. “O Sati, Daksayani, my beloved, I shall not take the hand of any woman except you as my wife. This is the truth that I say.

43. This was the agreement that He made with Sati formerly. She is dead. How then will He take another woman to be His wife.

Brahma said:

44. After saying these words, the lord of mountains kept quiet in your presence. O celestial sage, on hearing that, you spoke words that revealed the truth.

Narada said:

45. “O lord of mountains, of great intellect, you need not worry. This daughter of yours, Parvati, was formerly the daughter of Daksa.

46. Sati was her auspicious name. Sati who was Daksa’s daughter became Rudra’s wife.

47. Being dishonoured at the sacrifice of her father, and being the witness of Siva’s dishonour she was furious and she cast off her body.

48. She herself is born in your house as Parvati. There is no doubt that she will become Siva’s wife.”

Brahma said:

49-50. O sage, all these details you mentioned to the lord of mountains. You told the previous history of Parvati that increased her pleasure and on hearing which, the lord of mountains, his wife and children were freed from all suspicions.

54-55. “O king of mountains, she will have a better throne than this. Siva’s thigh will be her permanent abode. On getting the seat on the thigh of Siva your daughter will go to the world where no eye or mind can reach.”

beloved of the mountain addressed her lord; the chaste lady who loved her daughter as ardently as her own life spoke to the lord of mountains thus.

Mena said:

1. As but is natural to women, the words of the sage have not been understood by me well. (I think it is better) that you perform the marriage of our daughter with a handsome bridegroom.
2. Let the bridegroom of Parvati be born of a good family endowed with good characteristic signs. In every respect that marriage will yield an unprecedented happiness.
3. Obeisance to you. Do everything necessary to make our daughter, as beloved to us as our own lives, very happy and delighted after being united with a good bridegroom.

Brahma said:

After saying this, with tears in her eyes Mena fell at the feet of her husband. Raising her, the lord of mountains, the most excellent among intelligent people, made a true statement.

Himalaya said:

O gentle lady Menaka, listen. I shall tell you the truth. Do not be under false impressions. The sage’s statement will never be false.
If you feel affectionate towards your daughter, zealously instruct your daughter. Let her perform the penance with Siva as the object, devotedly and steadily.
If Siva is delighted, O Menaka, He will marry her. Everything shall be auspicious. The inauspicious features indicated by Narada will perish.
All inauspicious things are auspicious in Sadashiva. Hence immediately teach your daughter to hasten to perform the penance for attaining Siva.

Brahma said:

On hearing these words of the lord of mountains, Mena was greatly delighted. She approached her daughter to advise her to take interest in penance.

14. On seeing the tender limbs of her daughter, Menaka was greatly distressed. Her eyes welled up in tears immediately.

15. The beloved of the lord of mountains was unable to advise her daughter to perform penance. Parvati understood the implied wish of her mother quickly.

16. Then the omniscient supreme goddess Parvati immediately spoke to her mother after consoling her again and again. Parvati said:

17. O mother, of great intelligence, listen in the early dawn today. At night I had a dream I shall tell you. Be pleased.

18. A brahmin sage advised me lovingly and compassionately to perform the penance of Siva, O mother. Brahma said:

19. On hearing that, Menaka called her husband there and told him the dream as seen by her daughter.

20. After hearing the dream of his daughter from Menaka, the lord of the mountains was pleased and he spoke thus to his wife. The lord of the mountains said:

21. O dear, at the end of the latter half of the night, I too had a dream. Please listen to it lovingly. I shall zealously explain it.

22. A great saint of exquisite limbs, as mentioned by Narada, arrived near my city with very great pleasure in order to perform penance there.

23. Delighted much I took my daughter there with me. He was recognised as Lord Siva, the bridegroom as mentioned by Narada.

24. Advising our daughter to render service to that saint I requested him to approve of it but He didn’t.

25. A great discussion took place (between her and Siva based on Sankhya and Vedanta). Thereafter at His bidding my daughter stayed there.

27. Hence, dear Mena, for some time the result of this has to be watched. Certainly know this to be the proper step for me.

Brahma said:

28. O excellent sage, the lord of the mountains having thus explained to Menaka, both of them remained watching its result, pure in mind.

29-30. When a few days passed by, lord Siva, the goal of saintly men, the cause of protection and enjoyment wandering here and there in his flutter and excitement due to the separation from Sati, came there with pleasure accompanied by a few of his Ganas, in order to perform penance. The lord was completely agitated due to Sati’s love and separation from her.

31. He performed his penance there, Parvati engaged herself in His service continuously accompanied by two of her maids.

32. Although the lord Siva was hit and wounded by the arrows of Kama who was sent thither by the gods to enchant Him, He was not swayed at all.

33. Burning Kama there by His fiery eye, on remembering my words, the lord became angry with me and vanished from the scene.

34. After sometime, Lord Siva quelled the pride of Parvati but he was propitiated by her again performing great penance.

35. Following the conventions of the world, the lord married Parvati after being sponsored by Visnu. Then everything auspicious ensued.

36. O dear, thus the story of the lord, the divine story of Siva, has been narrated in brief. What is it that you wish to hear again?

2. What did Siva, separated from Sati, do? When did He go to the excellent ridge of the Himavat to perform penance?
3. How did the discussion between Siva and Siva take place? How did Parvati attain Siva by performing penance? O Brahma, these and other connected with the divine life of Siva, pleasing and auspicious, you kindly narrate.

On hearing this inquiry of Narada, Brahma, the excellent lord of the worlds, remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and spoke.

Brahma said:

O celestial sage, most excellent among the devotees of Siva, listen to His glory that sanctifies, renders everything auspicious and increases devotion.
Returning to His mountain, Siva in his excitement caused by his separation from his beloved, remembered Sati, who was dearer to Him than his very life.
Addressing His Ganas, He bewailed her and narrated her good qualities heightening love. In this way He showed the way of the world to the people.
Abandoning the polished manners of a householder, He cast off his dress and roamed about all the worlds, clever in divine sports that He was.
Not seeing her anywhere, the pangs of his separation from Sati increasing, Siva, the benefactor of His devotees, returned to His mountain and entered into trance.

for the destruction of misery. Thereupon He saw His imperishable real form.

12. Thus Siva remained for a long time eliminating the three attributes, and unaffected by aberrations. The lord Himself, the controller of illusion remained in the state of the Supreme Brahman.

13. Then He gave up trance. Many years elapsed. What happened thereafter, I shall now recount to you.

14. The drops of sweat caused by exhaustion fell on the Earth from the lord’s forehead and took the shape of a child immediately.

15. O sage, the child was tawny-coloured and had four arms. He was comely in features. His brilliance was supermundane and unbearable to others.

16. Like a common child he cried in front of the Great lord who was engaged in worldly activities.

17. Afraid of Siva, the Earth pondered deeply over it and appeared before him in the guise of a good lady.

18. She lifted up the child immediately and held him to her chest. Lovingly she suckled the child with her excellent breast milk that flowed over her body.

19. She kissed the child’s face lovingly and petted him smilingly. In the absence of Siva she herself acted as his mother in the interest of lord Siva.

20. Siva knew that she was the Earth. Siva, the cause of protection and enjoyment, the immanent soul, on seeing her activities became contented and eagerly said to her laughingly.

21. “O Earth, you are blessed. Rear this child of mine lovingly, born of my glittering drops of sweat over you.

22. Although the child is born of the sweat of my body, O Earth, he will be famous in the world after your name. He will be a bestower of pleasures and will be free from the three distresses always.

23. This boy of yours will be a bestower of lands and will have good qualities. He will make me too happy. Accept him with pleasure.”

Brahma said:

relieved of His pangs of separation. Siva, free from aberrations, and a lover of good men, acted thus only for following the worldly conventions.

25. The Earth too, as Siva bade her, returned to her abode along with the child. She was extremely happy.

26. The child acquired the name Bhauma (son of the Earth). He attained youth immediately. For a long time he worshipped lord Siva at Kasl.

27. By the grace of lord Siva, the son of the Earth, acquired the status of a planet. He went to the heavenly sphere beyond the region of Venus.

28. O sage, thus I have told you the story of Siva and His separation from Sati. Now listen to the story of His performance of penance.

# CHAPTER ELEVEN

# (Siva and Himavat meet together)

Brahma said:

1-2. O Narada, the daughter of the mountain, honoured in the three worlds, was brought up in the palace of Himacala. When she was eight years old, Siva distressed by Sati’s separation came to know of her birth. Keeping her wonderful memory within his heart He rejoiced much.

3. In the meantime, following the conventions of the world, Siva wished to perform penance in order to concentrate his mind properly.

4-5. Taking some important Ganas of quiet nature, Nandin and others, with Him, He went to the excellent Himalayan ridge— Garigavatara, O sage, where the great holy river Ganga flowed from Brahmapura10 formerly, in order to quell sins.

20. Cunningham (A. G. P. 299) identifies Brahmapura (the Po-lo-ki-mo-pu-lo of Hwcn Thsang: Waters, I. P. 329) with the capital city Vairitapauana of the hilly country lying between the Alakanandft and the Karaali rivers. The territory covered the districts of Garhwal and Kumaon (Cf. Br. S. ch. 14 and G.D. P. 40) and was stretched within 667 miles in circuit.

6-7. Staying there, Siva of full self-control, started His activities of penance. With full concentration and alertness He thought on His own Self, the cause of mental knowledge, the eternal, the luminous, free from affliction, identical with the universe, consciousness and Bliss, without a second and having no support.

8-9. When Siva began His meditation, the Pramathas also began their meditation as well as some Ganas, Nandin, Bhrngi etc. Some of the Ganas rendered service to Siva, the Supreme Self. Some of them became His gatekeepers. They observed silence and did not shout.

10. In the meantime on hearing that Siva had come to Au^adhiprastha, the mountain Himavat too went there.

11. Accompanied by his attendants, the lord of the mountains bowed to the lord Siva, worshipped Him with pleasure and eulogised Him with palms joined in reverence. Lord Himavat said:

12. O great god, lord of the gods, O lord Siva, the three worlds are sustained by you alone who are lord of the worlds. Obeisance to Thee, O lord of gods, obeisance to the one who has assumed the form of a Yogin, obeisance to Thee that art possessed and devoid of attributes and obeisance to Thee who art sportive.

13. O Siva, obeisance to the resident of Kailasa, obeisance to one who wanders all over the worlds, obeisance to thee the great lord, to the one indulging in divine sports, obeisance to the trident-holder.

14. O lord, of complete and perfect qualities, obeisance to Thee, devoid of aberrations. Obeisance to Thee without aspirations. Obeisance to Thee without desires. Obeisance to the bold one, to the great soul.

15. O overlord of the three attributes, O lord of delusion, favourably disposed towards the people, obeisance unto you, who grant inner pleasures of the soul. Obeisance to Brahman, the great soul.

16. Obeisance to Thee, worthy of being served by Vi?nu.

Brahma and others; obeisance to Thee of the form of Vi$nu and Brahma; obeisance to Thee, the creator of Visnu and Brahma, obeisance to Thee O one favourably disposed to the devotees. O one engaged in penance, O one the venue of penance; obeisance to Thee the bestower of fruits of penance; obeisance to Thee who lovest penance; obeisance to Thee of the form of Brahman and quiescent.

Obeisance to Thee who lay down the principles of dealings and worldly conventions; obeisance to the great Siva full of attributes; obeisance to Thee the great soul.

O great lord, your divine sports are incomprehensible. They bestow happiness on saintly men. Your nature is subservient to the devotees and you are under their control. You are the performer of all activities.

O lord, you have come here because my fortune is in its ascendancy. You have been described as a bestower of favours to the distressed. You have put me under your patronage and protection.

Today my life has borne fruit, in fact everything connected with me has become fruitful since you have come here.

Knowing me to be your slave of great composure, great lord, you can freely command me. With my mind not fascinated by other things I shall serve you with great pleasure.

Brahmd said:

On hearing these words of the lord of mountains, lord Siva slightly opened his eyes and cast a glance on the lord of mountains who was accompanied by his attendants.

On seeing the lord of mountains with his followers, the bull-bannered god Siva, the lord of the universe permanently engaged in meditation and Yogic practice said smilingly.

Lord Siva said:

I have come to perform penance in secret on your top. Make arrangements so that none should be able to come near me.

27. You are a noble soul, the abode of penance and permanent residence of sages, gods, demons and other great men.

28. You are the permanent residence of brahmins and others; you are always sanctified by Ganga; you render help to others and you are the lord and king of all mountains.

29. O king of mountains, delighted in resorting to you and controlling my senses and mind I am going to perform penance here at Gangavatarana.

30. O lord of mountains, O best of mountains, now put forth all endeavour whereby my penance can be conducted without obstacles.

31. O excellent Mountain, this alone is the greatest service that you can render. Please arrange for it with due effort. Please return to your abode with your mind full of pleasure.

Brahmd said:

32. After saying this, the lord of the worlds, the cause of protection and enjoyment kept silent. The lord of the mountains then spoke to Siva with affection.

Himdcala said:

33. O great lord of the universe, I have come myself and worshipped you. What shall I ask you who stay in my own kingdom?

34. O great lord, you cannot be attained by great penance even by the gods who put forth great efforts. But you yourself have come here.

35. There is none more fortunate than me; there is none more meritorious than me, since you have come to perform penance on my summit.

36. O great lord, I consider myself greater than the god of gods. You have come here with your Ganas and made me blessed.

37. O lord of gods, independently and without any

22. It is a sacred place celebrated in the Matsya and Vayu Purinas where the river Ganga emerges from the Vindu Sarovara through visible outlets and subterranean channels.

obstacles perform your great penance. O lord,- I am your slave always. I shall do all service to you.

Brahma said:

1. After saying this, the lord of the mountains returned at once to his abode and enthusiastically narrated everything to his beloved wife.
2. O Narada, calling together all his attendants with the members of their families, the lord of the mountains said emphatically.

Him&#x26;cala said:

From now onwards, none of you shall go to the ridge of mine, called Gangavatarana. This is my command. I am telling you the truth.
If anyone of you goes there I shall punish that rogue particularly. This is the truth I am speaking.
O sage, after thus checking all of his attendants, the mountain made other arrangements also. I now tell you all about the same.

# CHAPTER TWELVE

# (Siva-Himavat dialogue)

Brahma said:

Then, the delighted lord of the mountains, took some fresh flowers and fruits with him and approached Siva along with his daughter.
Approaching the lord of the three worlds, engaged in meditation and bowing to Him he mentally dedicated to Him, his wonderful daughter.
Placing the fruits and flowers in front of Him and making his daughter stand before Him, the lord of the mountains spoke to Siva.

Himdcala said:

O lord, my daughter who is eager to serve you, the

moon-crested lord, I have brought here with a desire to propitiate you.

5. Let her serve you, the benefactor, for ever, along with two of her maids. O lord, if you wish to bless me, please permit her.

Brahma said —

6-10. Then Siva looked at her in the first flush of her youth. Her complexion resembled the full blown blue lotus petals. Her face appeared as the full moon. Her auspicious dress and features were the repositories of all graceful charms. Her neck had the shape of the conchshell. Her eyes were wide and her ears shone exquisitely. On either side, her long-rounded arms resembling a lotus-stalk shone beautifully. Her two breasts resembling lotus-buds were stout, plump and firm. Her waist was slender and the curly locks of her hair shone well. Her feet resembled the land-lotus and were comely in appearance. She was competent to shake the minds of even the sages deeply engrossed in meditation, even at the very sight. She was a crest-jewel of all the maidens in the world.

11-12. On seeing her in that exquisite form as increased the pleasure and love of even those who meditate, the great Yogin Siva closed His eyes immediately and meditated upon His real form, the great principle that is beyond the three attributes and is imperishable.

13-14. On seeing Siva the lord of all, the chief of those devoted to penance, the lord with the moon as his ornament, who can be known through spiritual insight and who was sitting in the meditative posture closing His eyes, Himacala saluted Him again. Though he was not disheartened, he entertained some doubts. Thus he, the lord of mountains, foremost of the eloquent, spoke to Siva, the sole kinsman of the universe.

Himacala said :

15. O great lord of the gods, O Siva, the merciful, O lord, open your eyes and look at me who have sought refuge in you. O Siva, O great lord, the delighter of the universe,

16.

# Sivapurdna

0 great God, I bow to you who destroy all adversities.

1 7. O lord of gods, the Vedas and the sacred lore do not know you entirely. Your greatness is beyond the sphere of words and minds, inexpressible by means of words and incomprehensible.

18. Not to speak of others, even the Vedas describe you with awe and timidity not positively but negating what you are not.

19. Securing your grace through devotion, many devotees become acquainted with you. Seeking refuge in you they get correct knowledge about your real self.

20. Please listen to my entreaty with a long heart. I am your slave. O dear lord, in humility I shall explain the same to you.

21. O great god Siva, by your favour I feel most fortunate. Lord, consider me your slave and be sympathetic towards me. Obeisance to you.

22. O lord, I shall be visiting you daily along with my daughter. O lord, be pleased to command me accordingly.

Brahma said:

23. On hearing his words, the great lord of the gods broke His meditation, opened His eyes, thought a little and spoke.

Lord Siva said:

24. “O mountain, you shall come every day to see me, leaving your daughter in your abode. Otherwise I cannot be seen.”

Brahma said:

25. On hearing the words of Siva in that view, the father of Siva the mountain, bowed his head and replied to Siva.

Himdeala said:

26. “Let this be kindly mentioned why this girl cannot accompany me here. Is she unworthy of your service? I do not know the reason thereof.”

# Rudrasarhita

Brahma said:

27. Particularly pointing out the worldly conduct of fake ascetics, the bull-bannered god Siva laughingly spoke to the mountain.

Siva said:

28. This auspicious slender-bodied maiden of comely hips and moon-like face should not be brought near me. I forbid you again and again.

29. A woman is a phase of illusion. As the scholars who have mastered the Vedas say particularly, a young damsel is a hindrance to ascetics.

30. O mountain, I am an ascetic, a yogin, never affected by illusion. Of what avail is a woman thrust on me?

31. Friend resorted to by great ascetics, you shall not say so again, since you are an adept in Vedic religion, a scholar and one foremost among the wise.

32. O mountain, by contact with a woman, worldliness springs up; non-attachment perishes and the virtuous penance is destroyed. O mountain, no any

33. Hence, no ascetic shall have truck with women. A woman is the root of all worldly attachments. She destroys all wisdom and detachment together.

Brahma said:

34. Speaking these and many other similar things to the lord of mountains, lord Siva the great Yogin, stopped.

35. On hearing these ruthless words of Siva free from sickness and desire, the father of Parvati became nervous, O celestial sage, and a little agitated. But he kept quiet.

36. On hearing the words of the ascetic and finding her father, the lord of the mountains, frightened, Parvati bowed to Siva and spoke these words clearly.

# CHAPTER THIRTEEN

# (Siva-Pdrvati dialogue)

Pdrvati said:

1. O Yogin, O lord, wise and clever, please listen to the reply to what you, as an ascetic, said to the lord of mountains.
2. O Siva, you perform this great penance because you possess the energy of penance. Your intellect is inclined to perform penance because you are a noble soul.
3. That energy is the Prakrti, the cause of all activities. Everything is created, sustained and destroyed by it.
4. O lord, please ponder over who you are and who this subtle Prakrti is. Without Prakrti how can the great lord of the phallic form exist? You are worthy of the worship, respect and meditation of all living beings for ever, thanks to Prakrti. Thinking of this in your heart, please reply.

Brahma said:

On hearing these words of Parvati, the great lord engaged in the causation of great enjoyment and protection became delighted. He laughed and said.

The great lord said:

I am destroying the Prakrti with my great penance. I remain in reality without Prakrti.
Indeed Prakrti should not be taken in by good people. They should remain unaffected eschewing all worldly conduct.

Brahma said:

O dear one, this was said by Siva in accordance with worldly conventions and dealings. Parvati thereupon laughed to herself and spoke these sweet words.

Pdrvati said:

O Yogin, O lord Siva, based on what you said

# Rudrasarhhitd

how can that Prakfti cease to exist and how can you be considered beyond that Prakfti?

11. You shall ponder over this and say with reference to the facts as they are. All these (the universe etc) are bound by Prakrti continuously.

12. Hence you shall not say anything, not do anything. Know that speaking, doing etc. is a Prakrta activity.

13. What you hear, what you eat, what you see and what you do—all these are (essentially) the activities of Prakfti. To say that it is unreal is meaningless.

14. O lord, if you are greater than Prakrti, wherefore do you perform penance, O Siva, now, on this mountain Himavat. O Siva, you have been swallowed by Prakfti,

15. you know your own situation. O lord, if you do not know your own situation why do you perform penance?

16. O yogin, what have I to do with an argument with you? Scholars say that without perception inference has no authority at all.

17. As long as the embodied beings remain the objects of the sense-organs, everything is Prakrta. Wise men consider it so.

18. O lord of ascetics, a longwinded talk is of no avail. Listen to my emphatic statement. I am Prakfti and you are Purusa. This is the truth. There is no doubt about it.

19. With my blessings you become qualitative and embodied. Without me, you are attributeless and incompetent to perform any activity.

20. Being always subservient to Prakrti you perform all activities. Self-controlled, free from aberrations and untainted by me how can you perform them?

21. If you are really superior to Prakfti, if what you say is true, you need not be afraid to be near me, O Siva.

Brahma said:

22. On hearing these words of PSrvatl based on the Samkhya system, Siva replied to her, upholding the Ved&#x26;ntin’t point of view.

# Swapur&#x26;Qa

Lord Siva said:

23. O Parvatl, O upholder of the Samkhya system, if you say so, O sweet-voiced lady, you render me unbidden service every day.

24. If I am the Brahman, the supreme lord, unsullied by illusion, comprehensible through spiritual knowledge and the master of illusion what will you do then?

Brahma said:

25. Having spoken to Parvatl thus, the lord, the conciliator and the blesser of the devotees spoke to the mountain thus.

Siva said:

26. O lord of mountains, here itself on your beautiful excellent ridge, I shall perform my penance showing to the world my real blissful form and nature.

27. O lord of mountains, permission shall be given to me to perform penance. Without your permission it is not possible for me (or any one else) to perform any penance here.

Brahma said:

28. On hearing these words of Siva, the lord of gods, Himavat bowed to Siva and said.

Himavat said:

29. The entire universe consisting of gods, Asuras and human beings, is yours. O great god, though insignificant, I blabber something to you.

Brahma said:

30. Thus addressed by Himavat, Siva, the benefactor of the worlds, laughingly permitted him to go.

31. Permitted by Siva, Himavat returned to his abode along with Parvatl. He wanted to visit Him daily.

32. Even without her father but accompanied by her maids, Parvatl approached Siva everyday for serving Him with devotion.

33. O dear, at the bidding of lord Siva, none of the

Rudrasarhhitd
Ganas, NandHvara and others, purely carrying out the orders of Siva, prevented her.

34. The discourse of Siva and Siva who represented the principles of Samkhya and Vedanta and who, if thoughtfully considered, are not different from each other, was very happy, and pleasing for ever.

35. At the request of the lord of mountains, Siva permitted Parvati to remain with Him being true to His words though with all gravity and seriousness.

36. He, the lord of individual souls, said to Parvati in the company of her maids—“You can serve me everyday. You can go (as you please). You can stay here fearlessly.”

37. Saying this, He accepted the goddess in his service. Siva is free from aberrations. He is a great Yogin, the lord who indulges in different kinds of divine sports.

38. This is the supreme courage of great ascetics possessed of fortitude that though surrounded by obstacles they are not overpowered by them.

39. Then, the lord of mountains, returned to his city and rejoiced in the company of his wife, the sages and attendants.

40. Siva mentioned the Yoga of meditation on the great Atman with His mind freed from obstacles.

41. Parvati, along with her maids, continued her daily service to the moon-crested lord, coming and going without any hindrance.

42. She washed Siva’s feet and drank that holy water. With a cloth heated in fire she wiped his body.

43. After worshipping Him with sixteen types of offerings duly, and bowing to Him repeatedly she used to return to her father’s abode.

44. O excellent sage, a long time elapsed as she continued her service to Him who was engrossed in meditation.

45. Sometimes accompanied by her maids, she sang exquisite songs of good note that increased love in the hermitage of Siva.

46. Sometimes she brought Kusa grass, flowers and sacrificial twigs. Sometimes, assisted by her maids, she scrubbed and cleaned the place.

47. Sometimes she stayed in the house of the moon-crested lord.

•cent lord, pure and holy. Sometimes she used to gaze at the lord lovingly and with surprise.

48-49 In the course of his penance sometimes the lord of the goblins thought about her as free from attachment. But as she was in her physical form He did not take her as His wife though she was near Him, though she was endowed with every feature of beauty, though she was capable of deluding even the sages.

50. On seeing her with perfect control over her sense-organs and engrossed in serving Him always, the lord mercifully thought.

51. “I shall take her only when the last seed of ego goes away from her; when she herself performs a penance.”

52. Thinking thus, the lord of the Bhutas reverted to meditation. The lord who could indulge in great sports became a great Yogin.

53. O sage, when Siva, the great Atman, sank into meditation, no other thought entered His mind.

54. As for Parvati, she served Him everyday with great devotion, always thinking on the form of that Great Soul.

55. Siva who was engrossed in meditation saw her every day in full composure. Forgetting His previous thoughts about her, He did not see her although He saw her.

56. In the mean time Indra, other gods and the sages eagerly sent Kama there at the bidding of Brahma.

57. They had been harassed by the demon Taraka, the demon of great strength. Hence they wanted to unite Parvati and Siva in love.

58. After reaching there Kama tried all his tricks but Siva was not at all agitated. He reduced Kama to ashes.

59. O sage, Parvati too was divested of her ego. At his bidding she performed a penance and obtained Him as her husband.

60. Parvati and Siva were very happy. Engrossed in helping others they carried out the work of the gods.

# CHAPTER FOURTEEN

# (The Birth of Tdraka and Vajrdhga and their Penance)

Ndrada said:

1. O Brahma, great devotee of Siva and disciple of Vi$nu, this great story of Siva and Siva has been narrated very well by you.
2. Who was this Taraka demon, Brahma, by whom the gods were harassed? Whose son was he? Narrate his story with reference to Siva.
3. How did Siva of full control reduce Kama to ashes? Please narrate that too with pleasure. The story of the lord is indeed wonderful.
4. How did Siva perform the severe penance for the sake of happiness? How did the primordial energy who is greater than the universe secure Siva as her husband?
5. O great scholar, narrate all these complete in every detail to me, your son, who has dedicated his soul to Siva and who has developed full faith in Him.

Brahma said:

O celestial sage, of great intellect, O foremost of my sons, whose sacred rites are laudable, I explain the entire story after thinking on Siva. Listen.
O Narada, first of all, you hear the birth of Taraka himself, to secure whose death great effort was made by the gods depending on Siva.
My son Marici begot KaSyapa who married thirteen daughters of Daksa.
The eldest of them Diti bore two sons: Hiranyakasipu the elder and Hiranyaksa the younger.
When these two began to harass the gods, Visnu assumed the forms of Man-lion and Boar and killed them. Then the gods became fearless and happy.
The distressed Diti sought refuge in KaSyapa and serving him with devotion and observing the sacred rites she conceived.
On coming to know of it, Indra entered her womb forcibly and cut it off many a time with his thunderbolt.



---


# 1 3.

By the power of her sacred rites, the child in the womb did not die as she was sleeping at that time, by a stroke of good luck. They were cut into seven pieces and so she had seven sons.

# 14.

These sons became gods by the name of Maruts. They all went to heaven along with Indra and were taken as his own attendants by the king of gods.

# 15.

Diti resorted again to her husband repenting for her action. She made the sage pleased by means of great service.

Kaiyapa said:

# 16.

Be pure and perform penance for ten thousand years of Brahma. When it is completed you will have a son.

# 17.

O sage, the penance was completed by Diti who performed it with faith. Thereafter from him she conceived and delivered of a son.

# 18.

That son of Diti named Vajranga (of adamantine limbs) was on a par with the gods. Befitting his name, his body was strong and powerful even from his very birth.

# 19.

At the bidding of his mother, he immediately abducted Indra, the lord of gods, the other gods and punished them in various ways.

# 20.

Seeing the distress of Indra and others, Diti became very happy. Indra and other gods became miserable due to their own actions.

# 21.

Always engaged in the welfare of the gods, I went there accompanied by KaSyapa. Employing gentle and peaceful words I got the gods released.

# 22.

Releasing the gods with respect, VajrSnga, a great devotee of Siva, was delighted in his heart, and he of pure soul, without any aberration, spoke.

Vajrdriga said:

# 23.

In order to achieve his interest, Indra killed the foetus of my mother. He has now tasted the fruit thereof. Well may he rule over his kingdom.

# 24.

O Brahma, I did this only at the bidding of my mother. I have no desire for the enjoyments of any one of the worlds.

# Rudrasaxhhitd

25. O Brahma, foremost of those who know the Veda, tell me the essence of real philosophy whereby I can ever remain happy, pleased in heart and from aberrations.

26. On hearing that, O free Sattvika sage, I said feelings constitute the essence of real philosophy. I shall lovingly create an exquisite lady.

27. After offering her who was named Varangi, to that son of Diti, I went to my abode in great delight. So also Kafyapa, his father.

28. Thereafter the demon eschewed his diabolical feelings and resorted to sublime thoughts. Since he was free from fiendish feelings he became happy.

29. But no sublime feeling entered in the heart of Varangi. With chastity and faith she served her husband lovingly in diverse ways.

30. Her husband Vajranga of great lordly status was glad very soon on account of her service. He then spoke thus:

Vajranga said:

31. O beloved, what do you wish? What is it that you cherish in your mind? On hearing that, she bowed to her husband and revealed her desire.

Varangi said:

32. “O my good husband, if you are so pleased grant me a powerful son who will conquer three worlds and cause misery to Vishnu.”

Brahma said:

33. On hearing the words of his beloved, he was disagreeably surprised and vexed. He was free from inimical thoughts. With perfect wisdom and Sattvika feelings in his heart he said:

34. My beloved wishes enmity with the gods. It does not appeal to me. What shall I do? Where shall I go? How can my vow be preserved from destruction?

35. If my wife’s wishes are fulfilled, the three worlds will be much distressed, so too the gods and the sages.

36. If my beloved’s desires are not fulfilled, I am sure...

SivapwrS^a to be cast into hell. In either case righteousness will be lost. This is what we have heard.

37. O sage, thus Vajranga whirled a lot in a dilemma. Intelligently he considered the corresponding strength and weakness of both the alternatives.

38. O sage, as willed by Siva, though intelligent the king of demons agreed to the proposal. He told his wife “So be it.”

39. For that purpose he performed another very difficult penance with great zeal with me as the object of worship, for number of years.

40. On seeing the great penance I went to him for granting the boon. With a delighted mind I told him “speak out the boon you wish to have.”

41. On seeing me in the firmament in the pleasant mood he worshipped and eulogised me as well as craved for the boon as desired by his wife.

Vajrdrga said:

42. O lord, give me a son who will be carrying out what is beneficent to his mother, who will be strong, valorous and efficient, who will be a storehouse of penance.

Brahmd said:

43. On hearing his words, O sage, I said “So be it.” After granting the boon I returned to my abode thinking on Siva, though a bit distressed.

# CHAPTER FIFTEEN

# (The penance and reign of Tdrakdsura)

Brahmd said:

1. Then that Varangl, devoted to him, conceived. The child within her body developed in many years with its brilliance.

2. That Varangl, when the time was complete, delivered of a son of huge body and great strength dazzling the ten quarters.



---


# 3.

At the same time, several phenomena of evil portent forboding misery and distress happened, when the son of Varfingl was born making the gods miserable.

# 4.

O dear, the phenomena of three varieties indicating great calamity and terrifying the worlds occurred in the sky, heaven and earth. I shall narrate them.

# 5.

With a terrifying noise, thunderbolts fell along with comets; shooting meteors rose up, making the world miserable.

# 6.

The earth with all the mountains quaked; the quarters blazed; the rivers and oceans were particularly agitated.

# 7.

The rough wind blew with a hissing noise. Gusts of wind with troops of tempests and dust for banner uprooted several trees.

# 8.

O great brahmin, the misty haloes around the sun and the moon in the grip of Rahu became the harbingers of great fear and unhappiness.

# 9.

At that time terrifying sounds that resembled those of the chariot issued forth from cracks and crevices in the mountains.

# 10.

Within villages, inauspicious vixens howled hideously vomiting fires; as it were, through their mouths along with the hissing and twanging sounds of the hootings and bowlings of owls and jackals.

# 11.

Lifting up their necks, the dogs barked in diverse ways producing sounds of singing or lamenting here and there.

# 12.

O dear, groups of mad asses ran here and there braying loudly and digging the ground with their hoofs.

# 13.

Terrified by the asses, birds flew up from their nests. In their excitement and flutter they honked and cronked. They did not find a peaceful perch anywhere.

# 14.

Beasts in sheds and forests roamed here and there in great fright as though beaten and driven about, passing urine and shitting dungs as they pleased.

# 15.

Frightened cows sprayed blood through their udders; their eyes brimmed with tears, clouds showering putrid matter became terrifying.

# 16.

Idols and images of deities appeared to cry and fly up. Even when there was no gale, trees fell down. Planets in the sky clashed with one another.



---


17. O excellent sage, these and similar portending phenomena occurred: Ignorant persons thought the submersion of the whole universe was imminent.

18. Then Kafyapa Prajapati thought well and named the powerful demon Taraka.

19. That heroic demon, with his manliness and valour manifesting quickly grew and developed with his steely frame like the lord of mountains.

20. Then the demon Taraka, of great strength and exploit, endowed with a lofty mind, requested permission of his mother for performing penance.

21. The permission having been secured, that demon possessing great power of illusion and capable of deluding even experts in the magical art, thought of performing penance in order to conquer all the gods.

22. Strictly adhering to the directions of his elders and preceptors he went to the forest of Madhu and performed a severe penance duly, having Brahma as his objective.

23. For a hundred years he performed penance with his hands lifted up, standing on only one leg and gazing at the sun. With his mind steady and firm he observed all sacred rites.

24. Then for a hundred years, the lord and king of Asuras, Taraka performed the penance: stood steady touching the ground with the single big toe.

25. For a hundred years he performed penance by drinking only water; another hundred years by sustaining himself on air alone, another hundred years standing in water and another hundred years standing on dry land.

26. A hundred years he performed the penance amidst fires, a hundred years in a topsy-turvy position and a hundred years supported on the ground by the palms of his hands. O a hundred years he remained with his head down and feet up clinging fast to the branch of a tree and inhaling the pure smoke of the sacrificial fire.

27. Thus with ardour, the king of the demons performed the severe penance duly unbearable even to those who heard about it.

28. O sage, in the process of such a penance, a huge

mass of light shot up from his head and spread all round. It caused great havoc.

30. All the worlds of the gods were well nigh consumed by it alone. O sage, all the celestial sages were hard hit and distressed.

31-32. Indra, the lord of gods, was extremely terrified. He thought “Some one is performing a penance. Surely he will usurp my position. This master mind shall in a trice destroy the whole cosmos”. All those who entertained similar doubts could not decide what to do.

33. Then all those gods and sages consulted one another and in their great fright they came to my world and approached me in a piteous plight.

34. Bowing to and eulogising me with palms joined in reverence, all of them explained everything to me distressed in mind that they were.

35. Coming to a definite conclusion with adequate thought as to the reason for the same, I went where the demon was performing penance in order to grant him the boon.

36. O sage, I told him thus— “Tell me what boon you want. A severe penance has been performed by you. There is nothing which cannot be granted to you”.

37. On hearing these words of mine, Taraka, the great demon, bowed and eulogised me and requested for a terrible boon.

Tdraka said:

38. “O Pitamaha, if you are glad and ready to grant me the boon what is it that cannot be achieved by me? Hence I request you for this boon. Please listen.

39. O lord of gods, if you are pleased and if a boon is to be given to me, be kind enough to grant me two boons.

40. O great lord, there should certainly be no man equal to me in strength in this entire universe created by you.

41. If a son born of Siva becomes the commander-in-chief of an army and discharges weapons against me, let my death occur then.

42. O excellent sage, thus requested by that demon, I granted him two boons and hastened back to my abode.

# 43.

Securing the excellent boon in accordance with his cherished desire, the demon was very glad and went to the town Sonita3.

# 44.

That great demon was crowned the king of the three worlds with the permission of Sukra, the preceptor of the demons.

# 45.

Then the great demon became the leader of the three worlds. He inaugurated his commanding position by harassing the mobile and immobile beings.

# 46.

He duly established his suzerainty over the three worlds. He protected his subjects but inflicted pain on the gods and others.

# 47.

Then the demon Taraka seized gems and jewels of all the guardians of the quarters, Indra and others, offered under duress by them on being afraid of him.

# 48.

Afraid of him, Indra surrendered his Airavata (white elephant) and Kubera all his nine treasures.

# 49.

White horses were surrendered by Varuna, the wish-yielding cow Kamadhenu by the sages and the sun out of fear for him surrendered his divine horse Uccaihlravas.

# 50.

Wherever a fine article was espied by the demon, he seized it immediately. The three worlds became void of all valuable things.

# 51.

O sage, the oceans though offered him their gems on account of fear. The entire earth became exuberant in productivity without being tilled and yielded what his subjects desired.

# 52.

The sun glowed gently and mildly as not to make him distressed. The moon was always visible with his brilliant light and the wind blew always favouring him.

# 53.

Whatever riches the gods possessed or the manes or others had, were forfeited by the wicked demon.

# 54.

Bringing the three worlds under his control, he declared Indra himself. He became the undisputed lord and ruled over them with perfect self-control.

S3. It was the capital of the Atura territory, later on called BApapura, as it was ruled by the powerful Atura Bipa, the devotee of Siva. According to Dey (G.D. PP. 21, 189) Sopitapura is still called by that name, and is situated, in Kamaun on the bank of the river Kedflra-Gahgi or Mand&#x26;kinl about 6 miles from U*4matha at a short distance from Guptaklir.

# CHAPTER SIXTEEN

# (Brahmd consoles the gods harassed and frightened by the demon Taraka)

Brahmd said:

1. The gods terribly tormented by Taraka, bowed to and eulogised me, the lord of subjects with great devotion.
2. On hearing the eulogy of the gods pleasing and true to facts I was highly pleased and replied to the heaven-dwellers thus.
3. O gods, welcome to you. I hope you are all fulfilling your duties without obstacles. Why have you all come here? Tell me.
4. On hearing my words those gods bowed to me duly and spoke. Being tormented by Taraka they were in a piteous plight.

The gods said:

O lord of the worlds, thanks to the boon received from you. The demon Taraka is very haughty. Driving us out with force he has taken possession of our positions.
Is it not known to you what misery has befallen us? Please dispel our misery quickly. We seek refuge in you.
He torments us wherever we happen to stay by day or at night. Wherever we flee we see Taraka.
O dear, lord of all, we are extremely harassed and agitated due to Taraka.
Agni, Yama, Varupa, Nirfti, Viyu and other guardians of the deities are under his control.

10. None of them is ever independent. All serve him in the manner of human beings accompanied by their followers.

11. Being harassed by him, the gods have become subservient of him. They are engaged in carrying out his wishes. All of us are his servants.

12. Our woman folk, the groups of heavenly nymphs have been captured by Taraka, the powerful.

13. No sacrifice is in the making. No ascetic is in penances. The charitable and virtuous activities are being seldom pursued in the worlds.

14. His commander-in-chief is a simple demon-Krauftca. He has now gone to the nether worlds and is harassing the people very much.

15. The regions of our three worlds have been forcibly taken, O Brahama, by this Taraka of sinful and ruthless temperament.

16. O lord of the worlds, we were in heaven but now that we have been turned out by that demon we shall go to any place which you may kindly suggest.

17. You are our final resort. You are our ruler, creator, and protector. But we are scorched in the fire of the name Taraka. We are extremely agitated.

18. Our ruthless activities against him have turned out to be weak and ineffective, even as medicinal herbs of great potency are rendered ineffective in an ailment brought about by the combination of all deranged humours.

19. We had some hope of victory in SudarSana the discus of Visnu. But even that discus has become ineffective in his neck where it has fallen as though it were a floral offering to a deity.

Brahmd said:

20. O sage, on hearing these words of the gods, I told them befitting the occasion.

21. “O gods, the demon Taraka has flourished, thanks to my words of blessings. His destruction through me does not seem proper.

22. Improper is the destruction through that source wherefrom he has flourished. Even a poisonous tree tended and

nurtured by one cannot be cut and felled down by oneself. 14

23. Siva is the most suitable agent to carry out your task. But I myself cannot do anything remedial in this case.

24. Taraka will be destroyed by his own sin. How that shall be done you know from me. I shall advise you.

25. Thanks to the power of the boon granted by me. Taraka cannot be killed by me or by Visnu or by Siva or by any one of the gods. It is true.

26. O gods, if there is a son born of Siva, he alone can kill the demon Taraka.

27. O best of gods, you carry out the remedy I am suggesting. By the grace of lord Siva, it can be successfully accomplished.

28. Satl, the daughter of Dak$a, formerly cast off her body. She is now born of Menaka’s womb. That event is already known to you all.

29. O gods, it is certain that lord Siva will marry her. Still you shall pursue your endeavour.

30. Make such arrangements as to ensure the discharge of semen into Parvatl, the daughter of Menaka.

31. Siva is a great Yogin who can make semen flow upwards in the body. Only Parvatl can make him discharge the semen downwards, out of the body. There is no other woman capable of it.

32. That daughter of the lord of the mountains is now in her prime of youth. She is serving Siva in his penance on the Himalayas.

33. As a result of the tenacious pleadings of her father, she is serving Him in meditation.

34. She is the most beautiful lady in the three worlds. She stands in front of Him and worships Him. Still lord Siva who is engrossed in His meditation is not distracted by her presence.

35. It is your duty to ascertain means to make Him desire Parvatl for His wife. O gods, do something in that direction very quickly.

36. I shall go to the demon’s abode and try to dissuade him from his obstinacy. O gods, you can go to your abode.

37. After saying thus to the gods I hastened to the demon Taraka. I addressed him thus.

Brahma said:

38. You are ruling over our heaven which contains the essence of all brilliance. You are desirous of getting more than what you bargained for at the time of your penance.

39. I granted you a boon but not the kingdom of heaven. Hence leave off this region. You can rule over the earth. O Asuras, even you can achieve the fruit of your activities as here in Devaloka. There is nothing to hesitate in this matter.

40. After thus exhorting the demon to leave off heaven, the lord of all, remembered Siva and vanished from the scene.

41. Leaving the heaven, Taraka descended to the earth. Stationed in the town Sonita, he ruled over the entire kingdom.

42. On hearing my words, the gods bowed to me and went to Indra’s abode. They were duly received by Indra.

44. After reaching there and consulting one another, the gods in a body lovingly told Indra.

The gods said:

45. “O lord, you should carry out the suggestions of Brahma and see that Siva is lovingly inclined towards Siva.

Brahma said:

46. After explaining everything to the lord, the gods went in all directions to their respective abodes with great pleasure.

# CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

# [The dialogue between Indra and Kamadeva]

Brahmd said

1. When the gods had gone, Indra remembered Kama, He was so afflicted by Taraka, the wicked demon.

2. In an instant, Kama, the lover of Rati, came there along with Vasanta. He was accompanied by Rati too. Being powerful enough to conquer the three worlds he was very haughty.

3. Making due obeisance standing in front of Indra, the lofty-minded Kama joined his palms in reverence and said:

Kdma said:

4. “What is the matter that has cropped up now? Wherefore was I remembered? Please tell me. I am here to carry it out.”

Brahmd said:

5. On hearing the words of Kama, Indra, the lord of the gods, said praising him lovingly saying “well done, very proper.”

Indra said:

6. O Kama you are blessed indeed, since you are in readiness to carry out the affair I have on hand. You have begun well.

7. Listen to what is relevant to the context. I shall tell you everything. My job is equally your job and not otherwise.

8. I have many friends and great friends at that. But, O Kama, I have no other friend on a par with you anywhere. O dear, for my conquest, the unparalleled thunderbolt has been made.

9. Even that weapon may sometimes be ineffective but you are never so.

10. Who can be dearer than the person from whom



---



538 Sivapur&#x26;na

one derives benefit? Hence you, my greatest friend, must carry out my task.

11. Time being accursed, a great irremediable misery has befallen me. None other than you can dispel it.

12. The test of a donor is at the time of famine; the test of a warrior is at the time of battle; the test of a friend is at the time of adversity and the test of a woman is in the financial weakness of the family.

13. O dear, the test of a real friend is in the time of distress and is also based on what he does behind the back. It is not otherwise. This is truth.

14. Now that an adversity has befallen me, which cannot be thwarted by anyone else, O dear friend, it shall be a test for you today.

15. This is not a matter that brings pleasure to me alone. This is a matter that concerns all the gods and others too.

Brahma said:

16. On hearing these words of Indra the fish-bannered god Kama spoke smilingly in words indicating love and gravity.

Kama said:

17. Why do you say like this? I make no answer to you. A helping unreal friend is neither seen nor spoken of in the world.

18. He who speaks much at the time of adversity will not turn out much. Yet, O king, my lord, I shall say something. O Please listen.

19. dear friend, I shall cause the downfall of that enemy of yours who is performing a severe penance to usurp your position.

20. I shall, topple gods, sages, demons and others through the side-glances of a beautiful woman. I do not at all take human beings into consideration.

21. Let your thunderbolt and other weapons of innumerable varieties be set aside. What will they do when I, your friend, am present?

22. I can undoubtedly make Brahma and Vi^u go

# Rudrasarhhita

astray. Others are of no consideration. I shall make even Siva fall.

23. I have only five arrows that are soft and flowery. My bow is of three types. That too is flowery. The bow-string consists of bees.

24. My support and strength is my beloved wife Rati. Spring is my minister. O god, I am having five forces. The moon, the storehouse of nectar, is my friend.

25. The sentiment of love is my commander-in-chief. The coquettish gestures and emotions are my soldiers. All these are soft and gentle. O Indra, I too am of that sort.

26. An intelligent man shall put together things that are mutually complementary. You shall therefore engage me in a task that accords with my capacity.

Brahma said:

27. On hearing his words, Indra was much pleased. Pleasing Kama, the bestower of cherished happiness, by means of his words, he spoke.

Indra said:

28. O dear Kama, you are competent to carry out the task which I have conceived in my mind. It cannot be realised through anyone else.

29. O Kama, foremost among my friends, listen. I shall explain truly for what I remembered you and desired your presence, O Kama.

30. Securing a wonderful boon from Brahma, the great demon Taraka has become invincible and a pest for everyone.

31. The entire world is harassed by him. Many virtuous rites are destroyed. The gods have become miserable and so also the sages.

32. He had been fought by the gods to the utmost of their ability formerly. But the weapons of all the gods became quite futile.

33. The noose of Varuna, the god of waters, snapped. When hurled at his neck by Vishnu, the discus Sudarshana was blunted.

34. The death of this wicked demon has been foretold.

540 Sivapur&#x26;na by Brahma, the lord of the people, at the hands of the boy born of Siva, the great Yogin.

35. O dear friend, this task must be achieved by you diligently. Then we, the gods, can be very happy.

30. It will be beneficent to me. It will render the whole world happy. Realising the duties of a friend you are now to act.

37. Siva is at present engaged in a great penance. The supreme lord is always independent. It is not to achieve any desire that He performs the penance.

38. For the sake of gods, at the bidding of her father, Parvati is attending on Him, I hear.

39. O Kama, you shall certainly do everything necessary to bring about an interest in her in the mind of Siva who has self-control.

40. You will become contented after this. Your miseries will be destroyed. Your exploit will be permanently established in the world. Not otherwise.

Brahma said: —

41. On being thus addressed, Kama was glad, his face beaming like a full blown lotus. He lovingly said to the lord of gods, “I shall undoubtedly do it.”

42-43. After saying this when he said “So be it” he said “yes.” Kama accepted it because he was deluded by Siva’s illusion. Accompanied by his wife and Spring he went to the place where Siva, the Yogin, was performing penance.

# CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

# (Description of the perturbation caused by Kama)

Brahmi said:

1. After going there, the haughty Kama, deluded by Siva's magic power, stationed himself, after first spreading the enchanting power of Spring all around.

2. The enchanting influence of Spring spread every-



---

Rudrasaitihita
where around Osadhiprastha, the penance-grove of Siva, the supreme lord, O excellent sage.

3. O great sage, the groves bloomed with special exuberance, O excellent sage, due to his power.

4. The fragrant flowers of Mango and Asoka trees shone heightening feelings of love.

5. The water lilies with bees hovering on them proved to be the causes for the rise of love in the minds of everyone.

6. The sweet cooings of the cuckoos heightened emotions of love. They were exquisite and pleasing to the mind.

7. O sage, diverse sounds of the hummings of the bees rang sweet in the ears of everyone heightening temptations of love.

8. The bright light of the moon scattered all around appeared to be the emissary of lovers and their beloveds.

9. At that time the Kaladipika (brilliant lamp) induced reticent haughty persons to love. O good sir, the wind blew gently but distressed those who were separated from their beloveds.

10. Thus the vast diffusion of Spring caused the display of emotions of love. It was unbearable to the forest-dwelling sages.

11. O sage, then, even the insentient beings had the emotions of love. What about the state of sentient ones?

12. Thus spring employed his unbearable power heightening the love of all living beings.

13. On seeing the untimely display of spring, Siva the lord, who had assumed a physical body indulging in divine sports, thought it surprising.

14. But He, the chief of the self-controlled and the remover of man’s misery continued his severe penance.

15. When spring spread everywhere, Kama accompanied by Rati stood on his left side, with the arrow of mango blossom taken out and kept in readiness.

16. Enchanting all people, he spread his influence. Who was not enchanted on seeing Kama in the company of Rati?

17. Thus they initiated their dalliance. The sentiment of love too accompanied by coquettish gestures and

542 Sivapurgna

Emotions reached the vicinity of Siva along with his attendants.

18. Kama, usually stationed within the mind manifested himself outside. But he could not find any vulnerable loop-hole in Siva whereby he could enter Him.

19. When Kama did not secure any entry within the great Yogin, he became deluded and frightened much through the magical power of Siva.

20. Who could gain access to Siva in meditation, who could fix an eye in his forehead that resembled fire with shooting blazing flames?

21. In the mean time Parvati came there along with her two maids and brought various kinds of flowers for Siva’s worship.

22. Certainly Parvati had a greater beauty than the most exquisite lady described by people on the earth.

23. When she wore pretty flowers of the season how could her beauty be described even in a hundred years?

24. No sooner did she enter within the proximity of Siva than He came out of his meditation for a short while.

25. Profiting by that opportune moment, Kama, by means of his arrow Har$ana delighted the moon-crest god Siva who was nearby.

26. O sage, in assistance to Kama, Parvati reached the place near Siva with emotions of love and accompanied by Spring.

27. In order to make the trident-bearing lord take interest in her, Kama drew his bow very carefully and discharged his flowery arrow on Him.

28. As was her usual practice she approached Siva, bowed to Him, worshipped Him and stood in front of Him (awaiting further instructions).

29. Parvati was stared at by lord Siva, while she was laying bare some of the limbs bashfully, as is natural to women in such circumstances.

30. Remembering the boon granted to her by Brahma formerly, O sage, lord Siva began to describe her limbs joy-

# Ruirasarhhitd

543

Siva said:

1. “Is this your face or the moon? Are these your eyes or lotus petals? These two eyebrows are the bows of Kama of noble soul.
2. Is this your lower lip or Bimba fruit? Is this your nose or the beak of a parrot? Do I hear your voice or the cooing of the cuckoo? Is this your slender waist or the sacrificial altar?
3. How can her gait be described? How can her comely appearance be described? How can the flowers be described? How can the clothes be described?
4. Whatever is graceful and sweet in the creation has been incorporated here. Indeed, all her limbs are exquisite in every respect.
5. How blessed is this Parvati of mysteriously wonderful features. There is no other woman equal to her in beauty in the three worlds.
6. She is a storehouse of the finest beauty. She has wondrous beautiful limbs. She is an enchantress of even sages. She increases great happiness.”

Brahma said:

After describing her body again and again, recollecting the boon granted by Brahma, Siva stopped.
When Siva put His hand within her garment and moved it, she, as is natural to women, bashfully withdrew and kept aloof.
O sage, then Parvati smilingly laid bare some parts of her body and cast graceful glances at Him with great pleasure.
On seeing these movements and gestures Siva became fascinated. Lord Siva indulging in great divine sports spoke these words.
“I feel great pleasure on merely seeing her. What pleasure shall I derive by embracing her?”
Thinking thus only for a moment, the enlightened Siva became detached, honoured Parvati and spoke.
“How wonderful and mysterious is the situation that has arisen! How is it that I have been deluded and fascin-

Though I am the lord and master, I have been perturbed by Kama.

44. If I, the master, were to yearn for the touch of a woman’s limbs what will not be done by other incompetent and insignificant creatures.

# CHAPTER NINETEEN

# (Kama's destruction by Siva)

Narada said:

1. O Brahma, the most fortunate one, what happened then? Be pleased to tell me that story that destroys our sins altogether.

Brahma said:

2. O dear one, hear the story of what happened thereafter. Out of love for me I shall recount Siva's sports that bring about joy.

3. On seeing the dissipation of His courage, lord Siva, the great Yogin, thought within Himself wondering much.

Siva said:

4. How is it that obstacles have cropped up while I am performing the great penance? Who can be that wicked person who has made my mind highly perturbed?

5. With love I have described in bad taste another man’s woman. I have contravened rules of virtue and transgressed the bounds of the Vedas.

Brahma said:

6. After thinking like this, the great Yogin, the goal of the good, surveyed all round, his suspicion having been aroused.

7. He saw Kama stationed on His left side with his



---


# RudiasarhhitH

bow fully drawn and ready to discharge the arrow. Kama was haughty and so was very senseless.

8. O Narada, on seeing Kama in that attitude, instantaneously anger was aroused in lord Siva, the supreme soul.

9. O sage, standing high up in the air, holding the arrow and the bow, Kama discharged his arrow, usually unerring on Siva.

10. The infallible weapon became futile on the great lord. The furious weapon calmed down in regard to the great soul, Siva.

11. Kama was frightened when his weapon failed. Standing there and seeing lord Siva, the conqueror of death in front, he trembled.

12. O great sage, when his endeavour became futile, Kama who was frightened much remembered Indra and all other gods.

13. O great sage, remembered by Kama, Indra and other gods came there, bowed to and eulogised Siva.

14. When the gods eulogised thus, a great flame of fire sprang up from the third eye of the infuriated Siva.

15. That fire originating instantaneously from the eye in the middle of His forehead blazed with flames shooting up and resembling the fire of final dissolution in refulgence.

16. After shooting up in the sky, it fell on the ground and rolled over the earth all round.

17. Even before the gods had the time to say “Let him be forgiven, let him be excused” it reduced Kama to ashes.

18. When the heroic Kama was thus slain, the gods became miserable. In their agitation they lamented much and saying “O what has happened?” they cried aloud.

19. With pallid face and limbs, the extremely agitated daughter of the king of mountains returned to her palace taking the maids along with her.

20. Due to the misery on account of the death of her husband, Rati fell down unconscious, as if dead.

21. When she regained consciousness after a while, Rati in her great agitation lamented loudly and said:

Rati said: — Where can I go? What shall I do?

that the gods have done in making my husband a victim thus? They have called him here and destroyed him.

O! O! O lord Kama, dearer to me than my vital airs, O bestower of happiness, what has happened here? Ha, Ha, my dear, my dear f#i

Brahma said:

Lamenting thus and crying out various piteous words she beat with her hands, kicked with her legs and plucked her hairs.

O Narada, on hearing her lamentation even the beasts and residents of the forest, nay all the immobile trees and bushes became miserable.

In the meantime Indra and other gods remembered lord Siva and consoled Rati saying as follows:

The gods said:

Take some ashes and preserve them. With effort check your fear. The lord will resuscitate your lover. You will regain your lover again.

There is none who gives us happiness or misery. All enjoy and experience the fruit of what they do. In vain do you curse the gods.

Brahma said:

After consoling Rati thus, all the gods approached Siva and propitiated Him. With great devotion they spoke these words to Him.

The gods said:

O lord, O great god, favourably disposed to those who seek refuge in you, be pleased to listen to these well intended words of ours.

O O Siva, be pleased to ponder over the action of Kama. lord Siva, there is no tinge of selfishness in what Kama has done.

O lord, he had been induced to do so by all the gods harassed by the wicked Taraka. O Siva, please know that it is not otherwise.

O lord, the chaste Rati is lonely and miserable.

now. O lord Siva, she is in great lamentation, O bestower of everything, please console her.

34. If you have finally disposed off Kama, O Siva, you are desirous of annihilating all the gods by means of your fury.

35. On seeing the distress of Rati, the gods are almost doomed. Hence you must remove the distress of Rati.

Brahma said:

36. On hearing their words, lord Siva was pleased. He said this to all the gods.

Siva said:

37. O gods, O sages, all of you listen attentively to my words. What has happened, thanks to my fury, cannot be altered.

38. The lord Kama, the husband of Rati, shall remain bodiless till Visnu incarnates as Krsna on the earth and marries Rukmini.

39. Krsna will beget Kama in Rukmini when he goes to Dvaraka26 and begins to procreate children.

40. His name will certainly be Pradyumna. The demon Sambara will abduct the boy at the time of his very birth.

41. After abducting the boy, the great demon, Sambara, will throw him in the sea. The foolish fellow will take him for dead and will return to his city.

42. O Rati, you shall stay in his city till then. There alone you will get back your husband Pradyumna.

43. Kama in the name of Pradyumna will regain his wife after killing Sambara in a battle. O gods, he will be happy thereafter.

44. After taking all the valuable properties of Sambara, he will go to the city again along with her. These words of mine are true.

Brahma said —

45. On hearing these words of Siva, the gods heaved a sigh of relief. Joining their palms in reverence and bowing to Him they said:

25 This town, associated with Lord Krsna, is situated in Kathiawar.

The gods said:

Brahma said:

On hearing these words of the gods, great God became delighted. The lord of all, the ocean of mercy, spoke again.

Siva said:

O gods, I am delighted. I shall resuscitate Kama within myself. He will be one of my Ganas and will sport about always.
O gods, this story should not be narrated in the presence of anyone. All of you return to your abodes. I shall destroy all miseries.

Brahma said:

After saying this Rudra vanished even as the gods were eulogising Him. The gods became delighted and free from mental suspense.
O sage, abiding by the directions of Siva and consoling Rati by means of the conciliatory words of Siva, the gods returned to their respective places.
O excellent sage, then Rati, the wife of Kama went to the city and waited for the time mentioned by Siva.

Kama to ashes it began to blaze all round without burning anything.

3. A huge hue and cry was raised in the three worlds consisting of the mobile and immobile creatures. Immediately the gods and sages sought refuge in me.

4. All of them in their agitation bowed to and eulogised me with their palms joined in reverence and the heads bent down. They intimated to me their grief.

5. On hearing that I pondered over the reason for the same, and remembering Siva humbly I went there in order to protect the three worlds.

6. That fire, out to burn everything, very brilliant with its shooting flames, was thwarted by me as I had the capacity by Siva’s grace.

7. O sage, then I made that fire of fury, out to burn the three worlds, tender in its blaze and mare-like in shape.

8. Taking that fire mare-like in form, at the will of Siva, I, the lord of the worlds, went to the sea shore, for the benefit of the worlds.

9. O sage, on seeing me arrived there, the sea took a human form and approached me with palms joined in reverence.

10. Bowing to and duly eulogising me, the grandfather of all the worlds, the ocean said lovingly.

The ocean said:

11-12. “O Brahma, the lord of all, why have you come here? Please command me with pleasure knowing me to be your servant.” On hearing the words of the ocean I remembered Siva. I spoke with love in order to benefit the world.

Brahma said:

13. O dear, intelligent one, causing the welfare of all the worlds, ocean, induced by Siva’s will, I shall explain to you.

14. This is the fire of fury of lord Siva, the great lord. It is in the form of a mare now. After burning Kama it was about to burn everything.



---


15. At the will of Siva I was requested by the gods who were harassed by it, and so I went there and suppressed the fire.

16. I gave it the form of a mare. I have brought it here. O ocean, I ask you to be merciful.

17. This fury of lord Siva, now in the form of a mare, you will bear till the final dissolution of all living beings. O lord of rivers, I shall come here, you shall release it. This is Siva’s wonderful fire of fury.

18. His perpetual diet shall consist of your waters. This shall be preserved by you with effort lest it should go down.

19. Thus requested by me, the ocean agreed. None else could have grasped Siva’s fire of fury thus.

20. That fire in the form of a mare entered the ocean and began to consume the currents of water. It blazed with all its shooting flames. The delighted sage, then, returned to my abode.

21. The ocean of divine form bowed to me and vanished. O great sage, the entire universe, freed from fear of that fire, became normal. The gods and the sages became happy.

Jf&#x26;rada said:

1. O dear Brahma, O disciple of Visnu, of great intellect, O Creator of three worlds, this is a very wonderful story of the great soul Siva that has been narrated.

2. When Kama had been reduced to ashes by the fire from the third eye of Siva and when that fire had been deposited in the ocean what happened thereafter?

Brahmd said:

1. O dear, of great intellect, listen to the story of the moon-crested lord, my master and the cause of great enjoyment and protection.
2. A wonderfully loud sound arose covering the whole firmament when the fire issuing from Siva’s eye burnt Kama.
3. On hearing that loud report and seeing Kama burnt, Parvatl was terribly frightened and she returned to her abode along with her maids.
4. Himavat along with his attendants and relatives was surprised on hearing that loud report. He was agitated on remembering that his daughter had gone there.
5. On seeing his daughter excessively agitated, the lord of the mountains was sorry. The lord of the mountains approached her gently as she was crying due to her separation from Siva.
6. Approaching her and wiping her eyes with his hand he said, “Dear daughter, do not be afraid, do not cry.” He took her on his lap and consoled her. The lord of the mountains took her immediately to his palace.
7. When Siva had vanished after burning Kama, Parvatl became extremely agitated due to His separation. She did not attain pleasure anywhere.
8. Returning to her father’s abode and meeting her mother, Siva, the daughter of the mountain, considered herself born again.
9. She cursed her own beauty. She said to herself, “O; I am doomed.” The daughter of the lord of mountains did not regain composure though consoled and assuaged by the maids.
10. She did not achieve happiness and peace in sleeping, drinking, bathing, or sitting amidst her maids.
11. Remembering the various gestures and movements of Siva, she muttered to herself ever and anon—“Fie upon my beauty. Fie on my birth and activity.”
12. Thus Parvati was much distressed in mind due to

# Sivapurdna

Separation from Siva. She did not at all feel happy. She always muttered “Siva, Siva.”

17. O dear, with her consciousness centred round the Pinaka-bearing lord, she continued to stay in the palace of her father. Siva bewailed much and fainted frequently.

18. The lord of the mountains, Menaka, and their sons chief of whom was Mainaka of undisturbed mind, tried to console her but still she did not forget Siva.

19. O celestial sage, O intelligent one, employed by Indra, the slayer of Bala, you came to Himalaya mountain roaming here and there as you pleased.

20. You were then worshipped by the noble-souled mountain. You enquired of his health and happiness and you were seated in a noble seat.

21. Then the lord of the mountains told you the story of his daughter from her service to Siva to the burning of Kama by Him.

22. O sage, on hearing that, you told the lord of the mountains — “Worship Siva.” You stood up, remembered Siva mentally and took leave of him.

23. O sage, leaving him you hastened to meet Parvati secretly, you a favourite of Siva, perfectly wise and engaged in helping the world.

24. Approaching Parvati and addressing her, you spoke to her respectfully. You are foremost among the wise and you were interested in her welfare. Your words were true.

Jfarada said:

25. O Parvati, listen. I am sympathetic to you. I shall speak truly. My words will be beneficent to you in all respects. They will lead to the achievement of your desire. They are free from aberrations.

26. The great god has been served by you without austerities. You had some pride which He, the blesser of the distressed, eradicated.

27. O Siva, after burning Kama, lord Siva though favourably disposed to His devotees, left you, since the lord is a great Yogin and so unattached to you.

28. Hence you shall propitiate Him by performing a

Rudraseahhitd 553

great penance. Siva will take you as His wife, after you have been sanctified by austerities.

1. You will never forsake the auspicious Siva. O goddess, you will not take any one other than Siva as your husband.

Brahma said:

On hearing your words, O sage, Parvati, the daughter of the mountain, heaved a sigh of relief and gladly spoke to you with palms joined in reverence.

Parvati said:

O sage, O omniscient one, you help all the worlds, please tell me a formula for the propitiation of lord Siva.
No sacred rite will ever fructify without a good preceptor. Truly this eternal statement of the Vedas was heard by me before.

Brahma said:

On hearing these words of Parvati, O excellent sage, you taught her the five-syllabled mantra of Siva in accordance with the sacred law.
O sage, generating her faith you told her the supreme efficacy of the great formula thus.

Narada said:

O goddess, listen to the wonderful efficacy of this formula on hearing which Siva becomes excessively pleased.
This formula is a king of all formulas. It yields all cherished desires, bestows all worldly pleasures and salvation, and appeals much to Siva.
Repeating this formula in accordance with the injunctions you shall propitiate Siva. He will certainly appear before you.
O Siva, meditate on His form, observing all restraints. Repeat the five-syllabled mantra. Siva will be pleased quickly. O chaste lady, perform the penance thus.

* The five-syllabled Mantra of Siva:



---


Siva can be attained through penance. Every one attains the desired fruits in penance and not otherwise.

Brahmd said:

1. O Narada, after saying thus to Parvati, you, the favourite of Siva, went to heaven, a casual visitor engaged in the welfare of the gods.
2. Narada, on hearing your words securing the excellent five-syllabled mantra, Parvati was extremely pleased.

# CHAPTER TWENTYTWO

# (Description of Parvati's penance)

Brahmd said:

1. After your departure, O celestial sage, convinced that Siva could be achieved by means of penance, Parvati became glad and decided to perform penance.
2. She took her maids Jaya and Vijaya into confidence and through them made her parents acquainted.
3. First she wanted her father Himavat, the lord of mountains, to hear her humble words.

The maids said:

1. O Himavat, let the words of your daughter be heard through us. She wishes to make her body, beauty and family fruitful. This can be achieved through penance and not otherwise.
2. O excellent mountain, the permission may kindly be given: “Let Parvati go to the forest and perform penance there.”

Brahmd said:

1. O excellent sage, thus requested by Parvati through the maids, the lord of the mountains carefully considered the proposal and said:

Himdcala said:

1. This appeals to me. If it appeals to Men£ as it ought to be, what else can be a better course?

9. There is no doubt about it that my House will be fortunate. If her mother also likes this, what can be more auspicious than this?

Drahmd said:

10. After hearing the words spoken by her father and (in a way) commanded by him, the two maids went to her mother along with her.

11. O Narada, approaching Parvati’s mother, they bowed down and with palms joined in reverence they respectfully spoke thus.

The maids said:

12. O mother, O gentle lady, please listen to the words of your daughter. Obeisance be to you. You will listen with pleasure and act accordingly.

13. For the sake of attaining Siva, your daughter wishes to perform a severe penance. She has secured the permission of her father. She now wants to seek it from you.

14. O chaste lady, she is desirous of making her beauty fruitful. If your permission too is received, the penance can be performed.

Brahma said:

15. O excellent sage, after saying this, the maids became silent. Distressed in mind, Mena did not accept the proposal.

16. Then P&#x26;rvati herself spoke to her mother joining her palms in humility and remembering the lotus-like feet of Siva.

Parvati said —

17. O mother, I shall be going in the morning for performing penance to achieve Siva. Please permit me to go to the penance-grove for the task.

Brahmd said:

18. On hearing the words of her daughter, Mena was distressed. That chaste lady called her daughter near and spoke to her in dejection.

# Sivapurdna

Mend said:

1. O daughter Siva, if you are distressed, if you wish to perform penance, you can do it at home. O Parvati, do not go out.
2. Where do you wish to go for performing penance? All the deities are in my house. All the holy centres and the different temples too are here.
3. Do not be stubborn, dear daughter. You shall not go out of your home. What did you achieve when you went out previously? What are you going to achieve at present?
4. Dear child, slender is your body and hard is the penance. Hence you shall perform penance here. You shall not go out.
5. For a woman to go to a penance-grove for the realisation of her desire is what we have never heard of before. Hence, dear daughter, do not go out for penance.

Brahma said:

Thus, in various ways, the daughter was dissuaded by her mother. But she did not find any pleasure except in propitiating Siva.
Parvati, the acquired name Uma, was prevented from going to the forest by Mena and forbidden to perform penance.
O sage, on realising that Parvati was quite dejected, Mena, the beloved of the mountain, permitted her to perform penance.
O excellent sage, on getting permission from her mother, Parvati remembered Siva and felt happy.
Bowing to her parents with joy, Parvati remembered Siva and set out for performing penance along with her maids.
Discarding all the fine clothes of her taste, she wore tree-barks and the fine girdle of Munja grass.
She eschewed necklace and wore the pure deer skin. She arrived at Gangavatarana for performing penance.
The Gangavatarana was in the Himalayan ridge.

26. See No. 22, P. 515

# Rudrasarfihitd

where Kama was burnt by Siva who was performing meditation.

32. Oh dear, that Himalayan ridge devoid of Siva was painfully seen by Parvati, the mother of the universe, the daughter of the mountain.

33. She stood for a while in the place where formerly Siva had performed penance and became dispirited by the pangs of separation.

34. Crying aloud “Alas O Siva” she, the daughter of the mountain, lamented sorrowfully and anxiously.

35. Suppressing the delusion with fortitude after a long time Parvati, the daughter of Himavat, got herself initiated for the observance of ritualistic activities.

36. She performed penance in the excellent holy centre Srngitlrtha which (later) acquired the title “Gauri-Sikhara” due to her performance of penance thereon.

37. O sage, many beautiful holy plants were laid there by Parvati for testing the fruitfulness of her penance.

38. Neatly cleaning the ground, the beautiful lady built the altar. Then the penance, difficult to be performed even by the sages, was begun.

39. Suppressing her sense-organs with her mind, she started the great penance in a place within the proximity.

40. In the summer she kept a perpetually blazing fire all round and remaining within continued muttering the mantra.

41. In the rainy season she continuously remained sitting on the bare ground on the rock and got herself drenched by the downpour of rain.

42. During the winter, with great devotion she remained in water throughout. During snowfall and in the nights too she performed her penance observing fast.

43. Performing such austerities and engrossed in the muttering of the five-syllabled mantra, Parvati meditated on Siva, the bestower of fruits of our cherished desires.

44. Everyday during leisure time she used to water the trees planted by her along with her maids and extended acts of hospitality.

27. It is one of the famous peaks of the Himalayas.

45. Chill gusts of wind, cool showers, and unbearable heat she bore with equanimity.

46. Different sorts of worries she did not mind at all. Sage, fixing her mind in Siva alone she remained firm and steady.

47. The first year she spent in taking fruits, the second in taking leaves, in the course of her penance. She spent many years thus.

48. Then Siva, the daughter of Himavat, eschewed even the leaves. She did not take any food. She was engrossed in the performance of penance.

49. Since she, the daughter of Himavat, eschewed leaves from her diet she was called Aparna by the gods.

50. Then Parvati performed great penance standing on one leg and remembering Siva, she continued muttering the five-syllabled mantra.

51. Clad in barks of trees, wearing matted hair and eager in the meditation of Siva, she surpassed even sages by her penance.

52. Parvati thus spent three thousand years in the penance-grove performing penance and meditating on lord Siva.

53. Remaining for a short while in the place where Siva had performed penance for sixty thousand years, Parvati thought like this.

54. Does not the Supreme lord know me observing these ritualistic activities now? Wherefore am I not followed by him though engaged in penance?

55. In the Sastras and the Vedas, lord Siva is always sung in praise by the sages as the bestower of welfare, omniscient, all-pervading and all-seer.

56. The lord is the bestower of all riches, the moulder of fine emotions, the bestower of the desires of devotees and the remover of their distress.

57. If I am devoted to the bull-bannered lord, discarding all desires, may He be pleased with me.

58. If the mantra of the Narada Tantra, consisting of five syllables has been continuously repeated by me with great devotion may He be pleased with me.

59. If I am a devotee without aberrations of Siva, the lord of all, may He be extremely pleased with me.

60. Pondering frequently like this incessantly, she performed penance for a long time, with her face turned downwards, her apparel of bark and mind without any aberrations.

61. She performed penance difficult to be performed even by the sages, so much so that people were struck with surprise.

62. All of them came there to witness her penance. Considering themselves blessed, they proclaimed thus approvingly.

63. “To follow the standard of the virtuous personages is declared to be conducive to greatness. There is no delimitation in penance. Virtue shall be honoured by the wise always.

64. After seeing or hearing about the penance of this lady what penance will be pursued by a man? A penance greater than this has never been before, nor will it ever be.”

65. Saying thus, they praised the penance of Parvati and joyously returned to their abodes. Even persons of sturdy countenance praised her penance.

66. O sage, listen to another surprising influence of the penance of Parvati, the mother of the universe.

67. Even the naturally inimical beings in and around her hermitage became free from animosity due to her power.

68. Lions and cows prone to the passions of love, hatred etc. ceased to harass one another, thanks to her greatness. O excellent sage, creatures like cats, mice

69. etc. who are born enemies to one another did not exhibit any bad characteristics there.

70. O excellent sage, trees bore fruits, grasses grew in plenty and flowers of variegated nature and colour blossomed there.

71. The entire forest became comparable to Kailasa as it were the achievement of her penance.

# CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE

[Attempt of Himavat to dissuade Parvati; gods go to meet Siva]

Brahma said:

1. O excellent sage, while Parvati was engaged in penance thus for attaining Siva, a long time elapsed but Siva did not appear.
2. Then Himavat came there along with his wife, sons and ministers and spoke to Parvati, who had resolved to continue her penance.

Himavat said:

O Parvati, O fortunate one, do not torture yourself by this penance. Dear girl, Siva is not to be seen. Certainly he is detached.
You are a young woman of tender limbs. You will be overpowered and exhausted by this penance. There is no doubt about it. I am speaking the truth.
Hence, O comely lady, get up. Come back to our house. Of what avail is Siva by whom Kama has been reduced to ashes?
O goddess, hence not being emotional, Siva will not come to claim you as the excellent lady. Why do you yearn for him? Just as the moon in the sky cannot be caught, O sinless girl, so also Siva is inaccessible. Know this.

Brahma said:

The same thing was said by Mena, Sahya18 mountain, Meru9, Mandara30, Mainaka31 and Krauflca31.

Footnotes:

1. It is one of the seven principal mountain ranges in India, a part of the Western Ghats at some distance from the sea. For details see P. 164.
2. It is a fabulous mountain, variously identified, supposed to be situated in the centre of the earth.
3. It is a great mountain which the Gods used for churning the ocean. It is supposed to be the mountain so named in Bhagalpur. For details see P. 48.

others, The unafflicted Parvati was thus sought to be dissuaded by various arguments.

10. When she was thus addressed by all of them, she with a broad smile, spoke to Himavat. Parvati said:

11. O father, O mother, O kinsmen, have all of you forgotten what I had said formerly. Even now listen to my vow.

12. This great God by whom Kama has been burnt in fury is detached (you say). I shall propitiate him, by means of penance. He is favourably disposed to His devotees.

13. All of you please go to your respective abodes with delight. He will certainly be pleased. You need not be anxious over this.

14. With my penance alone here itself, I shall bring Him who burnt Kama and the mountainous forest.

15. Sada4iva can be easily served through penance. Ye fortunate Sirs, please know this truth. I am telling you the truth.

16. After addressing thus, her father Himalaya, her mother Menaka, her brothers Mainaka and Mandara, the eloquent Parvati, the daughter of the king of mountains, kept quiet.

17. Thus addressed by Parvati, (he lord of mountains and the other mountains went back the way they came, surprised within and praising her.

18. After all of them had departed, she with firm resolve in the great Truth, accompanied by her maids performed a severe penance.

19. O excellent sage, by that great penance the three worlds including the gods, Asuras and men, nay all the mobile and immobile beings, became heated.

20-21. The Prajapatis, the Guhyakas and others experienced great distress but could not understand the reason thereof. The gods, Asuras, Yakṣas, Kinnaras, Caranas, Siddhas, Sadhyas, the sages, the serpents and the Vidyadharas too had the same experience.

33. Siddhas, Sidhyas, Yakṣas, Kinnaras, Vidyidharas, Nāgas and Guhyakas are a class of semi-divine beings, thousands in number, of great purity and holiness, who reside in the Himalayas attending on Siva.

All of them, Indra and others, who were extremely agitated, took leave of their preceptor and sought refuge in me on the mountain Sumeru. All their limbs had been scorched.

Devoid of splendour, and agitated excessively they bowed to and eulogised me. They spoke simultaneously thus.

# 24.

The gods said:

“O lord, the whole of this universe consisting of the mobile and immobile has been created by you. Why is it scorched so much? We do not understand.

# 25.

O Brahma, please tell us the reason. O lord, you shall protect us, the gods whose bodies have been scorched. There is none else to protect us.”

# Brahma said:

# 26-27.

On hearing their words I remembered Siva and pondered over everything. I realised that the universe was scorched as a result of Parvati's penance. Accompanied by them I hastened respectfully to the milk ocean to inform Vishnu about it.

Reaching that place along with the gods, I saw Vishnu shining lustrously on a splendid seat. Bowing to and eulogising him with palms joined in reverence I spoke.

32. O gods, we shall request lord Siva to approach Parvati and marry her for the welfare of all the worlds.

33. We shall do everything necessary to make the Pinaka-bearing lord of the gods go there to grant the boon to Siva.

34. Therefore now we shall go to the place where the great lord Siva of severe penance, the conferrer of all auspicious things, stays.

Brahma said:

35. On hearing those words of Visnu, the gods and the rest became excessively afraid of Siva, the furious, the annihilator and the one desirous of burning everything.

The gods said:

36. We dare not go near the great lord Siva who is very terrifying, furious and who has the burning brilliance of the deadly fire of dissolution.

37. Undoubtedly he will burn us all in His anger as Kama, the indefatigable god, has been burnt by him.

Brahma said:

38. O sage, on hearing the words of Indra and others, Visnu, the lord of Laksmi spoke these words, consoling all the gods.

Vishnu said:

39. O gods, listen with pleasure and attention to my words. The lord, the destroyer of the fear of gods, will not consume you in fire.

40. Considering Siva to be benevolent you shall shrewdly seek refuge in Him,

41. We shall all seek refuge in Siva, the ancient Purusha, the lord, of excellent features, greater than the greatest, the supreme self, the great one resorting to penance.

2. At first Visnu and others who were anxious to see the penance of Parvati went to her hermitage which was on the way.
3. On seeing the excellent penance of Parvati and being enveloped by her refulgence they bowed to her who was engaged in penance and who had brilliant features.
4. After praising the penance of Parvati whose body was achievement personified, the gods went to the place where the bull-bannered lord was present.
5. After reaching there the gods sent you in, O sage, and stood at a distance from Siva who had reduced Kama to ashes. They were watching.
6. O Narada, you the fearless devotee of Siva approached Siva and saw the lord extremely pleased.
7. O sage, you came back again and beckoning to the gods, with effort you took them, Visnu and others, to Him.
8. Then Visnu and other gods went there and saw lord Siva, favourably disposed to His devotees, delighted and comfortably seated.
9. Then Visnu, the gods, the Siddhas, the sages and I bowed to and eulogised Siva seated in the Yogic posture, surrounded by the Ganas. He was seated in the form of penance. We eulogised Him with hymns from the Vedas and Upanisads.

4. You are the creator of all the worlds; lord, you shall save us. O great God, except you who else is competent to destroy misery?

Brahma said:

5. On hearing these words of the gods, Nandikeivara who was endowed with great sympathy began to inform Siva.

NandikeSvara said:

6. O foremost among the gods, Vi?nu, other gods, the sages and Siddhas eulogise you in order to see you. They are being threatened by Asuras. Hence they seek some remedy and resort to thy feet, the seat of great fearlessness.

7. Hence, O lord of all, the sages and the gods shall be protected by you. You have been particularly mentioned as the kinsman of the distressed and favourably disposed towards your devotees.

Brahma said:

8. Siva, who was thus informed by Nandin and who was extremely sympathetic, slowly reverted from His meditation and opened His eyes.

9. Then lord Siva, the highly efficient great Atman, reverted from His trance and spoke to the gods.

Siva said:

10. “O great gods, Visnu, Brahma and others, why have you come near me? Mention the reason for the same.”

14-15. O Siva, the demon Taraka will be killed only by your self-begotten son and not otherwise. Ponder over what I have said and take pity on me. Obeisance, O great lord, to you. O lord, redeem the gods from the misery brought about by Taraka. O

16. Hence, lord Siva, Parvati shall be accepted by you and grasped with your right hand. Accept her hand as offered in marriage by the lord of mountains. She is full of noble attributes.

17. On hearing those words of Vi?nu, Siva was pleased and said indicating to them the goal of the good, eager in Yogic feats as He was.

Siva said:

18-19. “If goddess Parvati, the most beautiful lady were to be accepted by me, she will be able to resuscitate Kama on account of the marriage. Then all the gods, sages and ascetics will become lusty and incompetent in the great path of Yoga.

20. Kama was burnt by me for the achievement of universal goal. It was at the suggestion of Brahma, O Visnu. No anxiety need be felt in this connection.

21. O lord of gods, O intelligent one, it is your duty not to be obdurate after considering the situation of what shall be done and what not.

22. O Vi?nu, a great favour to the gods has been done by me when Kama was burnt. May ye all stay free from lust certainly along with me. O can without

23. Just as I, so also you, gods, effort perform difficult tasks being endowed with the energy of great penance.

# RudrasarhhitS

25. O Brahma, O Vi$nu, O Indra, O sages and O gods, what had been done by Kama formerly and forgotten by you may be recollected and pondered over.

26. O gods, meditation of everyone had been spoiled by the stubborn Kama, the great archer formerly.

27. Kima leads to hell; lust to anger, anger to delusion and delusion destroys penance.

28. Anger and lust shall be eschewed by you, the best of gods. My words shall be headed by you all and not otherwise.

Brahma said:

29. After saying thus, the bull-bannered lord Siva expressed the wish that Brahma, Vi?nu, the gods and the sages, should speak.

30. Siva became quiet after resorting to meditation again. Siva, as before, was surrounded by His Ganas.

31-33. Siva thought within Himself His own Soul, the form that is unsullied, free from distortions, aberrations and ailments, the form which is greater than the greatest, eternal, free from sense of possession, free from obsessions, beyond the ken of sounds and words, devoid of attributes and knowable through perfect wisdom. Thinking upon His own features thus in His meditation, the lord, the cause of great enjoyment and protection became engrossed in supreme bliss.

34. On seeing Siva again engaged in meditation all the dwellers of heaven, Visnu, Indra and others, humbly told Nandin.

The gods said:

35. What shall we do now? Siva has become detached and has gone on meditation. You are a companion of Siva and pure assistant. You are omniscient.

36. O chief of the Ganas, we seek refuge in you. Please guide us. What is the remedy by which Siva can be propitiated?

40. O gods, great lord cannot be made subservient by ordinary devotion. The supreme lord does even what shall not be done when moved by extraordinary devotion.

41. O Brahma, Visnu and other gods, then act accordingly, otherwise go the way you have come. Tarry not.

Brahma said:

44. Thus the gods eulogised Siva with many piteous entreaties. They cried loudly being agitated by their devotion.

45. Visnu accompanied by me spoke out many piteous words, remembering Siva with great devotion.

46. Siva was thus eulogised by the gods, Visnu and me. He, the great lord, ceased His meditation due to His attachment for His devotees.

47. The delighted Siva said heightening the pleasure of Visnu and other gods, after glancing at them with merciful looks. Siva is favourably disposed to His devotees.

•Siva said

48. O, Visnu, O Brahma, O Indra and other gods, why have you all collectively come here in my presence? Tell me the truth.

immanent being and the lord of all. Don’t you know what is in our mind? Still I speak at you bidding.

50. O Siva, many kinds of miseries have befallen us due to the demon Taraka. It is for that that you have been propitiated by the gods.

51. For attaining you Siva is born of mountain Himacala. The demon’s death can be at the hands of your son alone begotten of her.

52. This is the boon granted to him by Brahma. Incapable of being killed by others, the demon harasses the entire universe.

53. At the instance of Narada, she is performing a great penance. All the three worlds consisting of the mobile and immobile beings have been enveloped by her refulgence.

54. O lord Siva, please go and grant Siva the boon. lord, destroy our misery and bestow happiness on us.

55. O Siva, there is a great enthusiasm in my heart as well as in those of the gods to witness your marriage. Please get it performed in a fitting manner.

56. The opportune moment for the fulfilment of the boon granted by you to Rati has arrived. Make your promise fruitful.

Brahma said:

57. After saying this and bowing to and eulogising Him with different hymns, Visnu, the gods and the sages, all of us waited in front of Him.

58. On hearing the words of the gods Siva, subservient to His devotees, laughed and replied. Siva is a strict preserver of Vedic conventions.

Siva said:

59. O Visnu, O Brahma, O gods, all of you please hear with attention. I am going to say a specific thing in a suitable manner.

60. Marrying is not a proper thing for men. Marriage is a great fetter that binds firmly.

61. There are many base bondages in the world. Association with women is the toughest of all. One can free oneself from all bondages except that of women.

# 62.

Anyone bound with nooses of iron and timber can secure release but one bound with nooses of women never frees oneself.

# 63.

Worldly enjoyment tightens the bondage. Salvation is inaccessible to a man drawn to worldly enjoyment even in his dream.

# 64.

If he wishes for happiness, an intelligent man shall duly forsake all worldly pleasures. Worldly enjoyment that dooms persons is on a par with poison.

# 65.

O Indra, a man attains downfall even by conversing with a sensuous person. Great preceptors say that worldly enjoyment is a bitter beer mixed with sugar.

# 66.

Although I know and realise all these, although I have specific wisdom yet I shall accede to your request and make it fruitful.

# 67.

I am definitely subservient to my devotees. Hence I may do everything. I am known all over the three worlds as one who performs ill fitting things.

# 68.

The vow of the king of Assam (Kamarupa) was made fruitful. I saved king Sudaksina who had become a hireling and a prisoner.

# 69.

I am the three-eyed God who bestows happiness but brought about the misery of Gautama. I especially curse those wicked persons who harass my devotees.

# 70.

I have the feelings of endearment towards devotees. I drank up poison for the welfare of the gods. O gods, the miseries of the gods have always been removed by me.

# 71.

For my devotees, I experienced many sufferings. I removed the misery of the sage ViSvanara by becoming a householder.

# 72.

What is the use of talking much? Vi$nu, Brahma, I speak the truth. All of you know truly that I have vowed as follows.

# 73.

Whenever any devotee of mine is involved in any adversity I remove it instantaneously and completely.

# 74.

I know the sufferings you undergo from the demon Tir&#x26;ka. I shall remove them. Truth, I tell you the truth.

Kirrurupa was also known as Pr&#x26;gjyolifm. The designation applies to the country now called Auam. In ancient days it comprised the north-eastern part of Bengal and the western portion of Assam.

Ndrada said:

1. When Brahma, Visnu and other gods had gone along with the sages what happened thereafter?

2. O dear one, what did Siva do? Within what time did He go to grant the boon? How? Please tell me for my pleasure.

Brahma said:

3. When Brahma and other gods had gone back to their respective abodes, Siva entered into spiritual contemplation in order to test her penance.

4. He meditated upon His own soul within Himself, the Atman that is greater than the greatest, free from illusion and obsessions and stationed within itself.

5. The bull-bannered lord Siva, the object of the expression That,* whose movements are unknown, is the cause of enjoyment and protection. Siva is the lord Supreme.

9. Bowing to Him with folded arms and bent shoulders they eulogised lord Siva with extreme pleasure by means of words choked with devotional feelings.

77.* seven sages said:

10. “O great God, lord of gods, O lord, O ocean of mercy, we have become very well blessed since we have been remembered by you now.

11. Why have we been remembered? We may kindly be commanded. O lord, have pity on us as on your own slaves. Obeisance be to you.

Brahma said:

12. On hearing the words of the sages, lord Siva, the storehouse of sympathy spoke lovingly and laughingly with eyes beaming like full-blown lotus.

Lord £wa said:

13. O dear seven celestial sages, listen to my words. You are all my benefactors. You are clever and perfectly wise.

14. The great Goddess Parvatl, the daughter of the mountain is performing a penance now in the mountain called Gaurisikhara, with a steady mind.

15. O brahmins, she is desirous of attaining me as her husband. She is being served by her maids. She has discarded all other desires. She is determined in her resolve. O excellent sages, you go there at my bidding.

Brahma said:

1. Thus commanded, those sages quickly went there where the mother of universe, the brilliant daughter of the mountain, shone with refulgence.
2. There she was seen as the personified achievement of penance itself. She was shining brilliantly with great splendour.
3. Mentaly bowing to her, the seven sages, of good rites, humbly spoke to her after being warmly welcomed and worshipped by her.

The sages said:

O daughter of the mountain, listen. Why do you perform this penance? Which god do you wish to propitiate? For what purpose? Please tell us now.

Brahma said:

Thus addressed by the brahmins, the goddess Siva, daughter of the lord of mountains, replied truly before them though it was a great secret.

Pdroati said:

O great sages, listen to my words with my hearty affection. I am saying only what I thought in my own way.
On hearing my words you will laugh at me considering my proposal impossible. O brahmins, I hesitate in revealing it but what can I do?
This mind of mine is resolute helplessly attempting at a great task. Verily it is trying to erect a high wall on the surface of water.
At the bidding of the celestial I am performing this steady penance with the desire that Rudra be my husband.
The unfledged birdling of my mind flies tenaciously. May lord Siva, the storehouse of mercy fulfil its desire.

BrahmS said:

28. On hearing her words, the sages honoured Parvati mentally with pleasure but spoke these deceptive false words laughingly.

The sages said:

29. O daughter of the mountain, although you are wise and intelligent, you are not able to see through the conduct of that celestial sage who professes to be a great scholar but who is cruel-minded.

30. Narada is a quibbler. He misleads others. If his words are paid heed to, you stand to lose in every respect.

31. Now listen to a true anecdote that sheds light thereon, with keen intellect. We are enlightening you out of love and affection, take it to heart.

32. Daksa, the son of Brahma, at the bidding of his father, begot ten thousand sons of his wife. He dearly loved them and employed them in performing a great penance.

33. The sons went to the holy lake Narayanasaras in the western zone for performing penance. Nosing it out, Narada too went there.

34. Sage Narada misled them with his deceptive instructions. At his instance, they never went back home to their father.

35. On hearing this, Daksa was infuriated but his father consoled him. Thereafter he begot a thousand other sons and engaged them in penance.

36. The sons too went to the same place for penance at the bidding of their father. Narada too went there, a self-appointed instructor for them.

37. He gave them the same instruction and they went the way of their brothers. They never returned to the parental abode. They were engrossed in the avocation of mendicants.

38. O daughter of mountain, the good conduct of Narada is thus well-known. Now hear about another activity of his in making men detached.

39. The NarSyapa lake has not been identified. Probably it is a lake of the Nirayapa hill, near Badrinatli in CailmaJ.

Rudrasartihitd
39. There was a Vidyadhara named Citraketu. The sage instructed him and made him detached from his house.

40. He bestowed his instructions on Prahlada and made him suffer much at the hands of Hiranyaka$ipu. He is definitely a person who splits others’ intellect.

41. Whomsoever this sage advocates his philosophy, very pleasing to the ears, generally the same person discards his hearth and home and begins to beg for alms.

42. Narada has a dirty soul though he is endowed with a white brilliant complexion for ever. We know him particularly because we are his associates.

43. People from a distance may describe a stork as a gentle bird that does not prey on fish. But in fact an associate knows the conduct of his associates.

44. You too who are honoured by the wise have followed his advice and thus become a fool. That is why you are performing this severe penance.

45. O young lady, He, for whose sake you are performing this elaborate penance is a perpetually indifferent person of no emotional disturbance. Undoubtedly He is an enemy of Kama.

46. The trident-bearing Siva has an inauspicious body, is free from shame and has no home or pedigree. He is naked and ill-featured. He associates with ghosts and goblins and the like.

47. That rogue of a sage has destroyed your discretion with his deception. He has deluded you with apparently good arguments and made you perform this penance.

48. O great Goddess, daughter of the mountain, you alone think within yourself how much pleasure could be derived by getting such a bridegroom.

49. At first he married Sati, the chaste daughter of Dak§a, eagerly but the fool that he was he could not maintain the household even for a few days.

He is after salvation, O gentle lady, how can a woman put up with him.

52. O blessed one, even now, at our bidding, return to your house. Cast off this foolish intention. You will benefit thereby.

53. A befitting bridegroom for you is lord Visnu endowed with all good qualities. He is a resident of Vaikuntha, lord of wealth and is skilled in sports.

54. O Parvati, with him we shall fix your marriage that will confer all happiness on you. Leave off this obduracy. Be happy.

Brahma said:

55. On hearing these words, Parvati, the mother of the universe, laughed and spoke to the wise sages.

Parvati said:

56. O excellent sages, what you have said may be true according to your light and wisdom; but O brahmins, my tenacity cannot be affected.

57. Being born of a mountain, toughness is congenital to my body. Pondering over this with a short intellect you will please desist from preventing me.

58. I shall never discard the wholesome advice of the celestial sage. Vedic scholars know and affirm that the advice of a preceptor is wholesome.

59. Those who firmly believe that the advice of the preceptor is true will experience great happiness here and hereafter. They will have no unhappiness anywhere.

60. Those who distrust the maxim in their heart of hearts that the advice of preceptors is true will experience nothing but misery here and hereafter, no happiness anywhere.

61. O brahmins, the advice of the preceptors is not to be eschewed at all. Whether it leads to the attachment of a household or otherwise, my tenacity will remain pleasing to me for ever.

62. O excellent sages, what you have just spoken shall

be interpreted in another way. I shall explain it in brief.

# 63.

When you glorify Visnu as the abode of noble qualities or as a sportive deity I do not contradict. As to your statement that Sadasiva is devoid of attributes I shall tell you the reason.

# 64.

Siva is Brahman, unchanging and without aberration. He assumes shapes and forms for the welfare of his devotees. He does not make a show of worldly lordship.

# 65.

Therefore he assumes the attitude and behaviour of great Yogins. Siva is a supreme bliss personified and an Avadhuta in form.

# 66.

Interest in embellishment and ornaments shall be found in those who are deluded by illusion and who are not in unison with the Brahman. The lord is devoid of attributes, unborn, free from illusion, of invisible movement and a cosmic Being.

# 67.

O brahmins, Siva does not shower His blessings on the ground of faith, caste etc- I know Siva truly only through the blessings of the preceptor.

# 68.

O brahmins, if Siva does not marry me I shall remain for ever a virgin. Truth, I tell you the truth.

# 69.

Even if the sun were to rise in the west, even if the mountain Meru were to move; even if the fire were to be cool and even if the lotus were to bloom on a rock at the top of a mountain, my stubbornness cannot be nullified. I am telling you the truth.

# Brahma said:

# 70.

After saying thus and bowing to those sages, the daughter of the mountain stopped and remembered Siva with an unruffled mind.

# 71.

On realising the resoluteness of Parvatl, the sages hailed her and bestowed excellent blessings upon her.

# 72.

O sage, after bowing to the goddess, the sages who wanted to test her were delighted. They immediately returned to Siva’s abode.

# 73.

Having reached the place they informed Siva of all the details. Taking leave of Him with respect, they went to the heaven.

# CHAPTER TWENTYSIX

# (Parvati-Ja(ila dialogue)

Brahma said:

1. When those sages returned to their abodes, lord Siva, the cause of great enjoyment and protection wanted to test the penance of the goddess.
2. Under the pretext of testing, Siva wanted to see her. With a delighted mind He assumed the form of a Ja(ila (an ascetic with matted hair) and went to the forest of penance of Parvati.
3. He took the form of a very old man with the body of a brahmin. His brilliance shone. He was delighted in mind. He had an umbrella and a staff (to support Him).
4. There He saw the goddess surrounded by her maids on the platform, as pure as the digit of the moon.
5. Siva, who is favourably disposed towards His devotees, approached her with pleasure in the guise of a celibate.
6. On seeing that brahmin of wonderful refulgence come, goddess Parvati worshipped Him with all the articles of worship.
7. She worshipped him with great joy by means of well prepared and arranged articles of worship. Thereafter Parvati enquired after the health of the brahmin with respect.

Parvati said:

Who are you and whence have you come in the guise of a Brahmacarin? You are making this forest refulgent by your splendour. Please speak, O foremost among Vedic scholars.

The brahmin said:

I am an aged brahmin roaming about as I please. I am an intelligent ascetic bestowing happiness and helping others.
Who are you? What is your parentage? Why do you perform penance in this isolated forest? Your penance cannot be surpassed even by the sages of eminent status.
You are neither a small girl nor an old woman.



---


# Rudrasarhhitd

You appear to be an auspicious young woman. How is it that you are performing this penance even when you are unmarried? O gentle lady, are you the wife of an ascetic who does not provide you with food and shelter and so leaving you has gone to another place?

Tell me, in which family are you born? Who is your father? What are your undertakings? You are very fortunate. Futile is your interest in penance.

Are you the mother of the Vedas? Are you Lakshmi or Sarasvati? I dare not guess who you are?

Parvati said:

O brahmin, I am not the mother of the Vedas, nor Lakshmi nor Sarasvati. I am the daughter of Himacala and my name is Parvati.

Previously I had been born as Sati, the daughter of Daksha. By Yogic means I cast off my body since my husband was insulted by my father.

Even in this life, Siva came to me but due to ill luck, He reduced Kama to ashes, left me and went away.

O brahmin, when Siva went away, I came out of my father’s house, being greatly dejected, to perform this steady penance on the banks of the celestial river.

Even after performing this severe penance for a long time, I could not attain Him. I was just to consign myself to fire but on seeing you, I have stopped for a while.

Now you can go. I shall enter fire since I have not been accepted by Siva. Wherever I take birth I shall woo only Siva.

Brahma said:

After saying so, Parvati jumped into the fire in the presence of the brahmin although she was forbidden by Him again and again.

39* The celestial Ganga is said to flow from the toe of Vishnu and to have been brought down from heaven, by the prayers of Bhagiratha to purify the ashes of the sixty thousand sons of king Sagara who had been burnt by the angry glance of the sage Kapila.

# Sivapurdna

22. Even as she jumped into the fire, it became as cool as sandal paste due to her ascetic power.

23. The brahmin stopped her standing on her way as she was trying to go away and asked her laughingly. The Brahmin said:

24. O gentle lady, I cannot understand anything. Your penance is wonderful. Your body is not charred by the fire. Still your desire remains unsatiated so far.

25. O gentle lady, let me know about your desire; I am a brahmin who can bestow pleasure upon everyone.

26. Please tell me everything truly and methodically. Since we have become friends nothing should be kept a secret from me.

27. I wish to ask you now. O gentle lady, whom do you wish to have as your husband? It is in you that the fruit of penance is seen.

28. If your penance is for others or for the supreme object, wherefore should you perform it at all? You had a jewel in your hand, you cast it off and have taken up a base metal instead.

29. Why have you rendered your beauty in vain by taking recourse to this penance that eschewing different sorts of fine clothes hide is worn by you.

30. Hence tell me the reason, truthfully, for this penance. Let me, a great brahmin, be pleased on hearing the same.

Brahma said:

31. Thus asked by him, Parvatl urged her maid. She of good rites made everything narrated to him through her maid.

32. Induced by Parvatl, her bosom friend Vijaya who knew all about her good rites spoke to the ascetic.

The maid said:

33. O saintly sir, listen. I shall recount the story of Parvatl as well as the reason for penance, if you wish to hear.

of mountains. She is the daughter of Menaka named Kali but famous as Parvati.

35. She is not married to anyone nor does she desire any other than Siva for her husband. She has performed this penance for three thousand years.

36. It was for that purpose that my friend started penance like this. I shall tell you the reason. Listen, O excellent brahmin, O saintly one.

37. Leaving off Indra and other gods, Visnu and Brahma, Parvati wishes to attain the Pinaka-bearing Siva as her husband.

38. My friend planted trees before. Brahmin, all of them have put forth flowers and fruits.

39-40. My friend has been performing severe penance at the bidding of Narada to make her beauty fruitful, to embellish her father’s race and to bless Kama. She has directed this penance to lord Siva. O holy ascetic, how is it that her desire is not fulfilled.

41. O excellent brahmin, you enquired of her desire. I have just told you out of my love for her. What else do you wish to hear.

Brahma said:

42. On hearing these truthful words of Vijaya, O sage, Siva who came disguised as an ascetic said laughingly.

The ascetic said:

43. The maid has said something, but I deduce only a huge joke therefrom. If it be true, let the gentle lady herself speak out.

Brahma said:

44. When these words were uttered by that brahmin ascetic, goddess Parvati spoke to the brahmin thus.

# (Description of the fraudulent words of the Brahmacarin)

Parvati said: —

1. O great brahmin, listen to my story entirely. What my friend has said just now is the whole truth, not otherwise.

2. I am telling you the truth and not a lie. Siva has been wooed by me, by mind, speech and action as well as by means of ascetic feelings.

3. I know that it is an inaccessible object. How can I attain it? Still out of my eagerness I am performing this penance.

Brahmd said:

4. After saying these words to him, the daughter of the mountain kept quiet. On hearing the words of Parvati the brahmin said.

The brahmin said:

5. So long I had been desirous of knowing what our gentle lady craves for that she performs this great penance.

6. O dear lady, I have now known it through your own words. I am now going away from this place. You can do as you please.

7. What should be done by you is not mentioned by me. To me your further friendship is useless. But this should be mentioned that your future should be happy.

and tender me wholesome advice”. When she said thus, the staff-bearing brahmin stopped and spoke.

The brahmin said:

1. If you are stopping me with devotion, truly desirous of hearing then I shall explain everything whereby you may gain some wisdom.
2. I know Siva through and through with all His weighty attributes. I shall tell you the truth. Listen with attention.
3. The great lord is bull-bannered. His body is smeared with ashes. His hair is matted. He is clad in the hide of a tiger. He has covered His body with the hide of an elephant.
4. He holds the skull. Serpents twine round His limbs. Poison has left a mark on his neck. He eats even forbidden stuffs. He has odd eyes and is definitely awful.
5. His birth and pedigree cannot be traced. He is devoid of the enjoyment of a householder. He has ten arms. He is mostly naked and is ever accompanied by ghosts and goblins.
6. What is the reason whereby you wish Him to be your husband? O gentle lady, where has your wisdom gone? Think well and tell me.
7. A previous terrible activity of His has been heard by me. If you are interested in hearing I shall tell you.
8. Daksa's daughter, the chaste lady Sati wooed Vfsabhavahana (Siva) as her husband. Fortunately their union was well known.
9. Sati was discarded by Dak$a because she was the wife of the skull-bearing Siva. Siva too was eschewed in the allocation of shares in the sacrifice.
10. On account of the insult Sati was infuriated and she discarded her dear life. Siva too was abandoned by her.
11. You are a jewel among women. Your father is the king of all mountains. Why do you crave for a husband like this and that too by means of a severe penance?

24. Leaving off the guardians of the quarters you run after Siva. This is not well said It is against the conventions of the world.

25. Where you with eyes like the petals of a lotus? Where this three-eyed creature— Siva? You are moon-faced while Siva is five-faced.*

26. On your head the divine plaited hair shines with glossy splendour like a serpent. But Siva has only the matted hair to boast of.

27. Sandal paste is applied on your body, while the ashes of the funeral pyre on that of Siva. Where your silken garment and where the elephant-hide of Siva.

28. Where the divine ornaments and where the serpents of Siva? Where the deities that move about and where Siva, fond of goblins and their oblations?

29. Where the pleasing sound of his tabor? Where His peculiar drum called Damaru? Where the set of fine drums and the inauspicious sound of his horn?

30. Where the inauspicious sound of double drum and where the sound of his throat? There is no matching beauty between you both.

31. If He had money to spare how could He have been a naked being? His vehicle is a bull. He has no other appendages.

32. There is not even a single quality in the odd-eyed Siva out of the imiumbcrable qualities pleasing to women and expected in bride-grooms.

33. Your friend Kama was burnt by Siva. He insulted you also by leaving you off and going elsewhere.

34. His casic is not recognised. He has no learning or wisdom. His assistants are the ghosts. Poison is seen even in His throat.

35. He also moves about in isolation. He is detached from everything particularly. Hence you cannot fix your mind in Him.

36. Where your necklace and where the garland of skulls that he wears? Where your rich divine unguent and where the ash from the funeral pyre that He has on His body? O divine lady, everything concerning you and Siva, such as form, features etc. is mutually discordant. I do not like your resolution. You can do whatever you please.

# (Pdrvati sees Siva's real form)

Parvati said: —

1. So long I have been thinking that some one else has come. Now everything has become clear. You are a person who cannot be killed.

2. O lord, what has been said by you is known. It is not otherwise. If what has been said by you is real, it cannot be called unreal.

3. Sometimes lord Siva is seen in that guise. But He is the supreme Brahman who, out of his own accord, takes up bodies in his own sports.

4. You have now come in the form of a student ascetic for the sake of deceiving me. Using false arguments, you have spoken fraudulent words.

# 5.

Siuapurdna

I know the real form of Siva very particularly. I shall therefore explain Siva’s reality in the proper perspective after careful consideration.

# 6.

He is in fact devoid of attributes. But for some reasons He takes up attributes. How can He have a birth, he who is really attributeless but takes up attributes?

# 7.

SadaSiva is the support and receptacle of all lores. Of what avail is learning to Him who is perfect and the supreme soul?

# 8.

At the beginning of the Kalpa, all the Vedas were given by Siva to Visnu in the form of breath. Who can be a good lord equal to Him?

# 9.

How can He be measured in age, He who is primordial to everything and everyone. Even primordial nature (Prakfti) is born of Him. Of what avail is then Energy to Him?

# 10.

With the threefold Energies, Siva blesses those who worship Him always as the lord of Energies.

# 11.

Every individual soul becomes fearless and conquers death by worshipping Him. Hence His designation ‘the conqueror of death’ is famous in all the three worlds.

# 12.

Vi$nu attains and retains his Visnuhood by His favour. Similarly Brahma his Brahmahood and the gods their godhood.

# 13-14

Whenever the lord of the gods wants to see Siva he has to propitiate His gate-keepers, the ghosts etc., otherwise his crown becomes shattered by batons. Really Siva is a great lord. He has no need for many attendants.

# 15.

What is it that cannot befall one who serves the auspicious-featured Siva. What is deficient in that lord? Does Sadasiva like me?

# 16.

Even if a person is perpetually poor for seven lives, after serving Siva, his prosperity becomes unhampered.

# 17.

How can he find benefit inaccessible—he in whose presence the eight Siddhis (achievements) dance always for the sake of propitiation with speechless mouths or with lowered faces.

| 41. | The three elements of Energy consist of (i) pre-eminent position, (a) good counsel and (3) adventurous undertaking. |

Although Siva resorts to inauspicious things yet by thinking on Him everything becomes auspicious.

# 19.

His worship fulfils all desires. How can there be aberration in Him who always remains in an unmodified state.

# 20.

People are sanctified by merely seeing the person in whose mouth the auspicious name “Siva” is ever present.

# 21.

If, as you say, the ash from the funeral pyre is unholy, how is it that the same transferred to Siva’s body is taken thence and worn on the head by the gods?

# 22.

How can He be easily realised, He who is the deity that creates, sustains and annihilates the worlds, all the same who is devoid of attributes and is termed Siva?

# 23.

The form of Siva, the supreme soul, is that of Brahman, devoid of attributes. How can people like you know it, people with extrovert faces?

# 24.

Persons of evil conduct, sinners and those who have gone astray from the path of the gods do not at all know the reality of Siva of attributeless form.

# 25.

If, out of ignorance of His reality, any one were to discredit Siva, his merit hoarded ever since birth becomes reduced to ashes.

# 26.

You have censured Siva of immeasurable splendour and I have worshiped you, hence I have become sinful.

# 27.

On seeing a person who hates Siva one should take bath along with one’s clothes. On seeing a person who hates Siva one should perform expiatory rites.

# 28.

O wicked one, you profess knowledge of Siva. But you should know that the eternal Siva is not known at all.

# 29.

Whatever may be the form or feature of Siva, He is multiformed. Still He is my favourite. He is without aberration and beloved of the good.

# 30.

Neither Visnu nor Brahma can equal that noble soul. How can then the gods and others be? They are always dependent on Time and are not eternal.

# 31.

After realising this with my sharp intellect factually, I have come to this forest and am performing the elaborate penance for attaining Siva.

# 32.

My ambition is to attain the supreme lord who is favourably disposed to His devotees and who blesses the distressed.

Brahma said: —

33. After saying this, O sage, Parvati, the daughter of the mountain, stopped and meditated on Siva with unaffected mind.

34-35. On hearing the words of the goddess when the brahmin ascetic began to say something, Parvati whose mind was fixed on Siva and who was averse to hear any disparaging remarks about Siva spoke immediately to Vijaya, her maid.

Parvati said:

36. This base brahmin must be prevented strenuously. He is inclined to say something again. He will surely censure Siva.

37. Not only does he who disparages Siva incur sin but also he who hears the same.

38. A person who disparages Siva is definitely worthy of being killed by Siva’s attendants. If it is a brahmin he must be dismissed or the hearer shall go away from that place immediately.

39. This wicked man will again disparage Siva. Since he is a brahmin, he is not to be killed. He shall be abandoned. He shall not be seen at all.

40. Let us leave this place at once and go elsewhere. Do not tarry. Let there be no more talk with this ignorant man.

Brahma said:

41. Saying this, O sage, even as Parvati was about to step ahead, the brahmin manifesting as Siva clasped his beloved.

42. After assuming the handsome form in the manner Parvati had meditated upon and manifesting it to Parvati, Siva addressed her while she stood with her lowered head.

Siva said:

1. “Where will you go, leaving me? You are not to be discarded again by me. I am delighted. Tell me what boon shall I grant you. There is nothing that cannot be given to you.
2. From today I am your slave bought by you by performing penance. I have been bought by your beauty. Even a moment appears like a Yuga.
3. O Parvati, O great Goddess, you are my eternal wife. Let this shyness be eschewed. You please ponder with your keen intellect.
4. O steady-minded one, you have been tested by me in various ways. Let my guilt be excused in following this worldly game.
5. Even in the three worlds I do not see a beloved like you. O Parvati, in every respect I am subservient to you. You can fulfil all your desires.
6. O beloved, come on near me. You are my wife. I am your bridegroom. I shall immediately go to my abode the excellent mountain, along with you.

Brahma said:

When the lord of the gods spoke in this way, Parvati rejoiced. Whatever distress she had felt during penance she cast off as something old.
O excellent sage, her weariness subsided. In fact, when the fruit is realised, the exertion felt during the process of undertaking perishes.

1. O celestial sage, let this be listened to. I shall resume the story joyfully, the story that quells all sins and increases devotion to Siva.
2. O brahmin, on hearing the words of Siva, the great Soul and on seeing His pleasant form and features Parvati was delighted much.
3. The highly chaste lady, goddess Parvati replied to the lord standing near with great pleasure and face beaming with love.

Parvati said:

O lord, O lord of gods, you are my husband, Has it been forgotten by you why you destroyed the sacrifice of Dakṣa formerly with great tenacity?
Listen, O lord of gods, I am born of Mena for the achievement of the task of the gods terrified to the quick by Taraka.
O lord of gods, if you are delighted, if you are sympathetic O lord, become my husband. O lord do as I say.
With your permission I am going to my father’s abode. Let your pure great glory be made well known.
O lord, you will please go to Himavat. Clever in divine sports, be the mendicant and beg of him, me as your alms.
Spreading your glory in the worlds you shall make everything about my father fruitful. Thus you start your householder’s life.
There is no doubt that my father with his kinsmen will accede to your request as he has already been urged by the sages lovingly.
Formerly as Dakṣa’s daughter I was offered to you by my father. But the marriage rites were not duly performed then.
The planets were not worshipped by my father. Therefore a great defect occurred in our marriage in regard to the planets.
Hence, lord, you will celebrate marriage in

# 15.

The customary procedures of the marriage shall certainly be followed. Let Himavat know that an auspicious penance has been performed well by his daughter.

# Brahma said:

# 16.

On hearing these words, Sadariva was highly delighted. Laughingly and lovingly He spoke to Parvati.

# Siva said—

# 17.

O great Goddess, listen to my important statement. See that our marriage rites are performed in the proper manner without deficiency.

# 18.

O sweet-faced one, all the living beings Brahma and others are non-eternal. O beautiful lady, know all these visible things to be perishable.

# 19.

Know that the single beings assumed manifold forms. The attributeless took over the attributes. That which is self-luminous had other lights imposed on it.

# 20.

O gentle lady, I, the independent, have been made subservient by you. You alone are the great illusory power, the Primordial nature that creates.

# 21.

This entire universe has been made of illusion; it is held by the supreme soul with His great intellect. It is united and enveloped by the Ganas of the nature of pervading souls of meritorious deeds, akin to the nature of supreme soul.

# 22.

What are these planets? What are these sets of seasons? What are those other planets? O gentle lady, what is said by you, O fair-complexioned one.

# 23.

We two have created the universe different in attributes and actions for the sake of the devotees and with a disposition favourable to them.

# 24.

You are indeed the subtle primordial nature consisting of Rajas, Sattva and Tarnas. You are capable of perpetual activity. You are both possessed and devoid of attributes.

26. O daughter of the mountain, I will not go up to Himavat your father. I will not become a mendicant and beg of him for you.

27. O daughter of the lord of mountains, even a weighty person endowed with great qualities, even a noble soul, is considered base immediately after uttering the words “Please give me”.

28. O benevolent lady, after knowing this what is it that you say is our duty? Gentle lady, do as you wish. Brahma said:

29. Thus addressed, the great goddess, the chaste lady of lotus-like eyes told Siva with devotion after bowing to Him again and again.

Pdrvali said:

30. “You are the cosmic soul and I am the cosmic nature. There is nothing to deliberate on this. We two are independent and subservient to the devotees. We two are both possessed and devoid of attributes.

31. O lord Siva, with effort, you will please do according to my request. O Siva, beg of Himavat for me. You will bestow a fortune on him.

32. O great lord, be sympathetic. I am your devotee for ever. I am your wife for ever in ever birth.

33. You are Brahman, the great soul, devoid of attributes greater than primordial nature, without ahberration, free from yearnings, independent, great lord.

34. Still you are possessed of attributes too and enthusiastic in the uplift of the devotees. You sport about in your own soul engrossed in it and you are clever in your different sports.

35. O great lord, I know you in every respect. O omniscient, of what avail is a detailed talk. Take pity on me.

36. Spread your glory in the world indulging in your wonderful divine sports. Singing them, O lord, people can cross the ocean of worldly existence.

Brahma said :

37. After saying these words to the great lord, Parvatl stopped and bowed to Him frequently with shoulders stooping and palms joined in reverence.

38. Thus addressed by her, Siva of the noble soul, just to follow and imitate the worldly conventions thought that it should be so. Being desirous of doing so he rejoiced.

39. Then Siva vanished. With a great delight He went to Kailfisa but at His separation from Parvatl his mind was distressed.

40. After reaching there He mentioned the news to Nandin and others. He was very much delighted.

41. Those Oanas, Bhairava and others were greatly pleased. They celebrated the occasion with great festivities.

42. Narada, all went on auspiciously. All misery was at an end. Siva too was in a pleasant mood.

Himavat excessively delighted went ahead seated in a divine vehicle.

6-7 The chief priest, the citizens, the maids, the kinsmen and also others accompanied them. All the brothers with Mainaka, the eldest, accompanied them highly delighted and crying shouts of victory.

8-12. The auspicious waterpot was placed in the main highway decorated with sandal paste, aguru, musk and branches of trees with fruits. The priests, brahmins and sages reciting the Vedas, dancing girls, all went ahead seated on lofty elephants to receive her. All round stumps of plantain trees were fixed. Women along with their sons and husbands held lamps in their hands. Brahmins were shouting mantras etc. in an auspicious voice. Various instruments were played. Conch shells were sounded. In the meantime Parvati reached the outskirts of the city. Entering the city she saw her parents again.

13. On seeing the parents rushing at her in their great delight, she gladly bowed to them along with her maids.

14. O They gave her their blessings and embraced her. Saying “darling,” they shed tears in their excitement of love.

15. Women near and dear as also the wives of her brothers embraced her closely with great pleasure.

16. “A great task has been well accomplished by you. It has saved the whole family. All of us are sanctified by your noble conduct.”

17. Praising her with these and similar words they bowed to her with great delight. They worshipped her with sandal paste and sweet scented flowers in great joy.

18. At that time the gods, seated in their aerial chariots in the sky, showered auspicious flowers, bowed to and eulogised her with hymns.

19. Then the Brahmins and others joyfully took you within the city in a resplendent chariot.

20. Then the brahmins, the maids and other women took her within the house with due honour.

21. O great sage, ladies performed her ceremonial ablution; the brahmins offered benedictions. Himvat and Menaka rejoiced much.

22. Himavat considered his household life fruitful. A daughter is far better than an ignoble son. He praised you too, Narada, saying “Well done, Well done”.

23. The lord of the mountains gave monetary gifts to brahmins and lords. He made the brahmins recite auspicious hymns, as part of the festivities.

24. The parents delighted with their daughter; the brothers and the sisters gathered joyfully in the courtyard, O sage.

25. The happy and delighted Himavat, honoured everyone. Then he went to the Ganga for his bath.

26. In the meantime, Siva, favourably disposed to His disciples and prone to divine sports, assumed the guise of a dancer and approached Menaka.

27-28. He held the blowing horn in his left and the drum in his right hand. He wore a red cloth and had the wallet suspended behind his back. In the guise of a dancer with the skill of dancing and singing, he danced well and sang many songs in sweet voice.

29. He blew the horn and played on the drum in very sweet tunes. Everything was very pleasant.

30. All the citizens men, women, children and old folks assembled there to witness the performance.

31. O sage, on hearing the sweet songs, and seeing the delightful dance, the people entered into raptures of ecstasy.

32-35. Parvati became unconscious. She saw Siva’s handsome form, bearing trident and other symbols before her vision. He had smeared the ashes all over His body. He was wearing a garland of bones. His face was beaming with his shining three eyes. He had the sacred thread of a serpent. Exquisitely white in complexion, the handsome lord Siva, the friend of the distressed, the ocean of mercy was repeating the words “Choose me the boon (or the bridegroom).” On seeing Him thus in her mind she bowed to Him. Mentally she had chosen the boon when she had said, “Be my husband”.

36. And He had granted her the auspicious boon with pleasure and vanished. The mendicant now continued the dance.

37. Mena who was greatly delighted took gems and jewels in gold vessels in order to give them to Him.

38. But the dancer did not accept the gifts. He requested for the hand of Parvati and began to dance and sing again.

39. Mena was surprised on hearing his words and she was furious. She rebuked the mendicant and wished to drive him out.

40. In the meantime the lord of mountains returned from the Gariga. He saw the mendicant in the human form in his court-yard.

41. On hearing the details from Mena he became very angry. He ordered his attendants to drive out the dancer.

42. But O excellent sage, none of them could push him out as he was hot to the touch like a blazing fire and very brilliant.

43. O dear, then the mendicant who was clever at diverse sports showed his endless great power to the mountain.

44. The mountain saw him immediately transmuted into the form of Visnu the four-armed, with crown earrings and yellow garment.

45. Flowers etc. which had been offered to the mace-bearing lord, Visnu, at the time of worship, he saw on the body and over the head of the mendicant.

46. Then the lord of mountains saw the four-faced deity, the creator of worlds, red in colour and reciting the Vedic hymns.

47. Then the lord of mountains saw the form of the sun, the eye of the universe, much to his enthusiastic amazement.

48. Then, O dear one, he saw him in the wonderful form of Siva accompanied by Parvati. He was smiling and shining beautifully.

49. Then he saw him in the form of a mass of splendour of no specific shape. It was unsullied, free from peculiar attributes and desires. It was wonderfully formless.

50. Thus he saw many forms and features there. He was surprised and delighted much.

51. Then the chief of mendicants begged of Himavat

52*54. The lord of mountains deluded by Siva’s magic did not accede to this request. The mendicant too did not take anything. He vanished from the scene. Then Himavat and Mena realised that Siva had deceived them and gone to His abode. After some pondering, they developed a feeling of devotion to Siva who is the cause of salvation, the bestower of divine bliss.

# CHAPTER THIRTYONE

# {Description of Siva's magic}

Brahma said:

1. On knowing their undistracted great devotion to Siva, O Narada, Indra and other gods, thought like this.
2. The gods said: If the mountain were to give his daughter to Siva with single-minded devotion he will attain salvation immediately and will disappear from Bharata.
3. The mountain is the storehouse of endless gems. If he were to leave off the Earth and go, the name of the Earth—Ratnagarbha (having gems in the womb)—shall be a misnomer.
4. He will cast off his immobile aspect and assume a divine form. He will give his daughter to the Trident bearing deity and will go to Siva’s region.
5. He will undoubtedly attain mergence into lord Siva, having enjoyed pleasures there, he will attain salvation.

Brahma said: Thinking like this and consulting one another they, in their bewilderment, decided to send god Brhaspati there.

45. Bh&#x26;rata, the land of Bharat as, derives its name from the Bharatai, an ancient powerful Aryan tribe mentioned in the Bgveda.

7. O Narada, then Indra and other gods, went to Bfhaspati’s abode lovingly with humility, in their eagerness to achieve their self-interest.

8. Reaching there, all the gods including Indra bowed to Bfhaspati and submitted every detail to him. The gods said:

9. O revered preceptor, please go to the abode of Himavat for the fulfilment of our task. After going there, you shall make disparaging remarks about the trident-bearing deity.

10-11. Parvati will not marry any other person except Siva. The mountain will derive the benefit only after some time if he gives the daughter in marriage without his full concurrence. Let the mountain stay on earth for the present. O preceptor, you shall make him stay on the earth as he is the support of many gems.

Brahma said:

12. On hearing these words of the gods, the preceptor of the gods, plugged his ears with his hands. He did not accept the proposal of the gods. He remembered the name "Siva".

13. Then remembering lord Siva, Bfhaspati of liberal mind rebuked the gods again and again and said.

Brhaspati said:

14. All of you gods seem to be selfish in nature. You want to destroy other’s interests. Indeed I will go to hell by disparaging Siva.

15. O gods, one of you shall go to the mountain. Let him urge the lord of the mountains and achieve the desired object.

16. Let him stay in Bharata after giving his daughter without willingness. It is certain he will attain salvation if he gives his daughter with devotion.

# 19.

On hearing it and consulting among themselves the gods came to my Assembly. After duly bowing to me they informed me about the details.

# 20.

On hearing the words of the gods about censuring Siva, O sage, I the reciter of the Vedas spoke to them in an aggrieved tone.

# 21.

“Dear children, I am incompetent to decry Siva. It is unbearable. It destroys all riches. It is the seed of all adversities.

O gods, all of you go to Kailasa and propitiate Siva. Make Him go to Himavat’s abode quickly.

# 23.

Let him approach the lord of mountains and make disparaging remarks about Himself. Rebuking others is conducive to destruction. Rebuking oneself is conducive to fame.

# 24.

On hearing my words, all the gods, joyously bowed to me and went to Kailasa, the chief of mountains.

# 25.

Going there and seeing Siva they bowed to Him with bent heads and palms joined in reverence. The gods eulogised Siva.

# The gods said:

# 26.

O great lord, lord of gods, O Siva, the merciful, we seek refuge in you. Be sympathetic. Obeisance be to you.

# 27.

O lord, you are favourably disposed to your devotees, always carrying out their tasks. You are the uplifter of the distressed, and an ocean of mercy. You save us from all our miseries and distresses.

# Brahmd said:

# 28.

Eulogising lord Siva thus, Indra and other gods respectfully submitted all the details.

# 29.

On hearing the words of the gods, lord Siva agreed to the proposal. He made the gods return after assuring them smilingly.

# 30.

Hastening to their abodes, the gods rejoiced much considering their work fully fulfilled and praising Sadasiva.

# 31.

Then the lord Siva who is favourably disposed to his devotees, the lord of magic and free from aberrations went to the lord of mountains.

# 32-33.

When the lord of the mountains was seated in his royal assembly along with Parvati and kinsmen, Sadasiva came there, in the meantime bearing a staff and an umbrella. He was dressed in divine clothes and had a shining mark on the forehead.

# 34.

He was in the guise of a saintly brahmin. He was repeating the name of Visnu with devotion. He had the garland of crystal beads in his hand and the Salagrama stone round his neck.

# 35.

On seeing that extraordinary guest, Himavat with his attendants stood up in reverence and prostrated before him with devotion.

# 36.

Parvati bowed with devotion to her dear lover in the guise of a brahmin. On realising him mentally the goddess eulogised him with great joy.

# 37.

With great pleasure Siva bestowed his blessings on all. O dear, He bestowed on Parvati her cherished desire in addition.

# 38.

The brahmin received with pleasure the articles of homage 47 etc. offered by Himavat, the lord of mountains.

# 39.

O sage, after duly worshipping the excellent brahmin with pleasure, the mountain Himavat enquired of his welfare. Again, lord of mountains asked him “Who are you, please?”

Immediately the chief of brahmins spoke to the lord of mountains thus.

48. O mountain, this inclination of yours is not at all conducive to auspiciousness. O foremost among the wise, born of Narayana's family, learn sense.

49. For the marriage of Parvati, He is not at all a deserving person. On hearing of this, the general public will smile in derision.

50. O lord of mountains, see for yourself. He has not a single kinsman. You are the storehouse of great gems and jewels. O He has no assets at all.

52. O lord of mountains, the medicine does not appeal at all to the patient. Wrong diet that brings about great defects always appeals to him.

53. Saying this, the brahmin stopped. He took food and left the place with pleasure for his abode. Siva is one who quietly indulges in His divine sports.

# Chapter Thirtytwo

# (The seven celestial sages arrive)

Brahma said:

1. On hearing the words of the brahmin, Mena spoke to Himavat with tears welling up in her eyes, due to grief and with the heart extremely dejected.

2. O lord of mountains, please listen to my words conducive to happiness. Please consult important devotees of Siva regarding what has been mentioned by the brahmin.

3. Many disparaging remarks about Siva have been made by this brahminical devotee of Visnu. O lord of mountains, on hearing these words, my mind is very much dejected.

4. O lord of mountains, I shall not give my daughter endowed with all good accomplishments to Siva with ugly features, ignoble conduct and defiled name.

5. If you do not accede to my request, I shall undoubtedly die. I will immediately leave this house or swallow poison.

6. With a rope I shall tie Parvati round my neck and go to a thick forest. I would rather drown myself in the great ocean. I shall never give my daughter to him.

7. Saying thus with great grief, Mena entered the chamber of anger. Casting off her necklaces she lay down on the ground sighing and sobbing.

8. O dear, in the meantime all those seven celestial sages were remembered by Siva whose mind was agitated by the pangs of separation from Parvati.

9. All those seven sages, 48 as soon as they were remembered by Siva, came there in person as though they were another set of wish-yielding Kalpa trees.

10. Arundhati too came there as though she was an achievement personified. On seeing them resplendent like the sun, Siva stopped his recitation of mantras.

14-15. Formerly we had performed three kinds of penance; we had studied the excellent Vedas; we had made offerings in the fire, we had visited many holy centres; thus whatever merit we have acquired verbally, mentally and physically that entire merit has now accrued to us by your blessing in remembering us.

16. A man who worships you always shall be blessed. How can that merit be properly described, the merit of those whom you O yourself remember?

17. SadaSiva, we have become the most excellent of all people by your remembering us. Usually you never even come across the path of ambitions and aspirations of ordinary people.

18-19. O lord, your vision, very difficult to be acquired, is like the fruit stooping down within the reach of the dwarf, like sight to a man born blind, like eloquence acquired by a dumb man, like the indigent meeting with a treasure-trove, like the lame man reaching the top of a high mountain and like the barren woman bearing a child.

20. By seeing you today we have become the most respectable sages worthy of the worship of all the worlds. We have reached the highest position.

21. O lord of gods, by seeing you who are the lord of all gods we have become worthy of great respect. There is no necessity of talking more.

22. If any duty is assigned to us it will be a favour to us. An auspicious task befitting us, your utter slaves, shall be given to us.

Siva said:

1. Sages are always to be adored and particularly you all. O brahmins, it was for a specific reason that you have been summoned here.
2. My attitude of being helpful is known to you. That must be achieved, especially in the interest of the fulfilment of the desires of the world.
3. Cause for great misery has arisen for the gods at the hands of Taraka the wicked. Boon has already been granted. He is invincible. What shall I do?
4. O great sages, all the eight cosmic bodies that I possess are not for furthering my self-interest, they are for helping the wide world.
5. A great penance has been performed by Parvati. That cannot be performed even by great sages. I have to give her the great fruit thereof. Indeed my vow is to render delight to my devotees. The fruit I bestow on her shall be conducive to her welfare. Hence I wish to marry her.
6. At the request of Parvati I went to the abode of the mountain in the guise of a mendicant. Clever in divine sports I thereby sanctified her.
7. On hearing to know that I am the supreme Brahman, the couple were desirous of giving me their daughter with great devotion in accordance with the Vedic manner.
8. On the inducement of the gods, in order to reduce the quality of devotion (of Himavat and Mena) I took the guise of a devotee of Visnu and rebuked myself.
9. O sages, on hearing it they were dejected and have now lost interest in me and do not wish to give their daughter to me.
10. Hence you all go to the abode of Himavat and urge the excellent mountain and his wife.
11. Speak out the words as venerable as the Vedas. Do everything necessary to get the matter straightened out and settled.

37. What is the use of talking too much? Himavat must be convinced. Mena too must be convinced similarly, so that the purpose of the gods shall be served well.

38. Whatever mode is selected by you shall be more than necessary. The task is yours. You alone are the sharers of the credit.

Brahma said:

39. On hearing these words, the seven sages of pure mind became delighted and thought themselves blessed by the lord.

40. “We have become blessed and contented in every respect. We have become venerable to every one, especially adorable.

41. He who is worthy of being respected by Brahma and Vi$nu, he who secures everything accomplished is sending us, his emissaries on an errand that is conducive to the happiness of all the worlds.

42. He is the master of the worlds and their father. She is considered the mother. Let this proper alliance increase for ever like the moon.”

43. Saying thus the celestial sages bowed to Siva and went by aerial path in the direction of the city of Himavat.

44. On seeing that city of heavenly splendour, the sages were surprised. Expatiating on their good fortune they spoke to one another.

The sages said:

45. We are really blessed and meritorious in being able to see this city because we have been engaged in a task like this.

46. This city seems to be better than Alaka, heaven.

and even Amaravati54.

47. The houses are beautiful and well-built. The courtyards are well laid out and paved with different kinds of crystals and jewels of variegated colours.

48. Slabs of solar and lunar stones are found in every house. Different kinds of celestial trees are also growing here.

49. The splendour of festoons is also seen in every house. They are of different colours and sorts with shapes of parrots and swans carved on the walls of the palaces.

50. The canopies with hanging festoons are of diverse character. There are many lakes and ponds.

51. The gardens and parks are of various kinds frequented by delighted people. Here men are like gods and the women are like the celestial damsels.

52. In the land of activities (i.e. Bharata), the sacrificial priests and the followers of Puranas perform holy rites with a desire to attain heaven. That is in vain because they have left off the city of Himavat.

53. Men are eager to go to heaven only as long as this city is not seen. O brahmins, when this city is seen what is the use of heaven?

Brahmd said:

54. Describing the city thus all those excellent sages went to the rich and well-furnished abode of Himavat.

55. On seeing those seven sages, resplendent like the sun, coming along the aerial path from a distance, Himavat was surprised and said:

Himavat said:

56. The seven venerable persons, resplendent like the sun, are approaching me. These sages shall be worshipped by me now.

57. We householders are really blessed, to whom great men like these, bestowing happiness on all, pay their visit.

53. It is the subterranean capital of the Nagas in the Nagaloka portion of Pfttala, to the famous city of Indra, supposed to be situated on Mount Meru.

Brahma said:

58. In the meantime they descended on the ground from the sky. On seeing them Himavat advanced to welcome them.

59. With palms joined in reverence he bowed to them with stooping shoulders and worshipped them with due respect and honour.

60. Desiring welfare of others, the seven sages embraced Himavat, the lord of mountains and spoke words of auspicious blessings with pleasant faces.

61. Keeping them ahead he said—“My household life is blessed”. With great devotion he got and offered them seats. When they were duly seated, too he sat with their permission. Then Himavat spoke to the refulgent sages:

Himavat said:

63-64. I am blessed. I am contented. My life is fruitful. I am the best person worthy of being seen in the three worlds. I am as pure as any of the holy centres. All this is because you, verily in lord Vi$nu’s forms, have come to my abode. Perfect ones such as you, what special purpose can there be in visiting poor persons like me?

65. Still I am your servant. Some task there may be to be entrusted to me. Mercifully may it be spoken out. May my life be fruitful.

# CHAPTER T£ n ITYTHREE

# (The appeasement of Himavat)

The sages said:

1. Siva is the father of the universe. Parvati is the mother of the universe. Hence your daughter shall be given to Siva, the supreme soul.

2. O Himalaya, by this activity your life will be

# Sivafwr&#x26;pa

Fruitful. You will become the venerable person of the most venerable in the universe. There is no doubt about it.

Brahma said:

# 3.

O great sage, on hearing these words of the seven sages, the lord of the mountains bowed to them with joined palms and spoke thus.

# 4.

Himavat said: O ye seven sages of great enlightenment, what you have just now said has been already cherished by me by the will of Siva.

# 5.

Now, a certain brahmin professing Vaisnava cult came here and spoke very critically about Siva.

# 6.

Ever since, the mother Parvati has gone out of sense. Hence she does not wish her daughter’s marriage with Siva.

# 7.

She has entered the chamber of anger. She is aggrieved and her clothes have become dirty. O brahmins, her obduracy is so great that she does not pay heed to any advice.

# 8.

I too am, you can say, out of sense. I am telling you the truth. I do not wish to give my daughter to Siva who is apparently a mendicant.

# 9.

Brahma said: O sage, after saying these words, the king of mountains deluded by Siva’s magic became silent and sat amidst the sages.

# 10.

The seven celestial sages praised the magic of Siva and sent Arundhati55 to Menaka.

# 11.

Then at the bidding of her husband Arundhati, the bestower of knowledge, went quickly to the place where Mena and Parvati were sitting.

# 12.

After going in she saw Mena lying in her grief. The chaste lady spoke to her these carefully selected sweet and wholesome words:

55. She is the wife of Vasishtha, one of the seven sages. In Hindu Mythology she is regarded as the highest pattern of conjugal excellence and wifely devotion.

# Rudrasarhhitd

Arundhati said:

13. O Mcnaka, get up. O chaste lady, I, Arundhati, have come to your house. The seven sages of sympathetic nature have also come.

Brahmd said:

14. On hearing Arundhati’s voice, Mena got up quickly and bowed to her who was on a par with Laksmi in her brilliance.

Mend said:

15. Ha, what a meritorious thing is this! We are blessed. Arundhati, the daughter-in-law of the Creator of the universe, the wife of Vasistha, has come here.

16. O gentle lady, what for is your visit now? Please tell me specifically. My daughter and I are your slaves. Be merciful to us.

Brahma said:

17. Arundhati, the chaste lady thus addressed, advised her in various ways and returned to the place where the sages were seated.

18. Then they began to advise the lord of the mountains, after thinking on the feet of Siva. They were clever in speech and they spoke respectfully.

The sages said:

19. O lord of the mountains, may our words, the cause of everything auspicious, be heard. Give Parvatl to Siva. Become the father-in-law of the world-destroyer.

20. For the destruction of Taraka, formerly Brahma requested Siva who is the lord of all and who does not beg of anyone, to strive for this alliance.

21. Siva, the foremost of Yogins was not eager to marry. But since requested by Brahma, the lord agreed to take your daughter.

22. Parvatl performed a penance and the lord promised her. Thus for these two reasons the lord of Yogins wishes to marry her.

610 Sicapur&#x26;na

Brahma said:

23. On bearing the words of the sages, Himavat laughed but he was a little frightened. He spoke with humility. Himavat said:

24. I do not see any royal paraphernalia with Siva, He has none to support him. He has no assets. He has no kinsman.

25. I do not wish to give my daughter to a Yogin who is extremely detached. Ye sons of the Creator of the Vedas tell me decisively.

26. If a father were to give his daughter in marriage to an unsuitable person, out of love, delusion, fear or covetousness, he is doomed. He will go to hell.

27. Out of my own free will, I will not give her to the trident-bearing Siva. O sages, whatever arrangement is befitting here, may kindly be carried out.

Brahma said:

28. O excellent sages, on hearing these words of the mountain Himavat, Vasi?tha, the most eloquent among them replied:

Vasiffha said:

29. O lord of mountains, listen to my words in every respect conducive to your welfare; they are not against virtue. They are true and shall bring about your joy here and hereafter.

30. Statements, in ordinary language and in the Vedas, are of three forms. A scholar knowing all lores understands them by means of his pure vision of knowledge.

31. It is only an enemy, though keen in intellect, who says what is pleasing to the ears now but what transpires to be untrue and unwholesome afterwards. He never speaks wholesome things.

56. Vasiffha was one of the seven great sages and one of the ten Praj&#x26;patis. There are several accounts about his origin. He is declared to have been either a mind-born son of Brahmft or the son of Mitra and Varu^a from Urvaif.

32. Only a virtuous and sympathetic friend will speak such words as are unpleasant in the beginning but conducive to happiness in the end.

33. But the third variety of behaviour, nectarlike to the ears, conducive to happiness on all occasions, essential and truthful is considered to be the most excellent.

34. O mountain, these are the three types of behaviour as mentioned in the treatises on polity. Tell me which type of behaviour shall I adopt to please you.

35. Siva, the lord of gods, is devoid of riches created by Brahma. But His mind is engrossed in the ocean of true knowledge.

36. How can lord Siva who is knowledge-Bliss Himself have any desire for articles created by Brahma? An ordinary householder gives his daughter to one who has a kingdom and riches in his possession?

37. By offering his daughter to a miserable person, a father may be guilty of slaughtering his daughter. Who can think Siva miserable whose servant is Kubera?

38. He is attributeless, supreme soul, great lord and greater than Prakfti. He can create and annihilate things by a mere sportive touch of His eyebrows.

39. His manifestations are threefold, He is the cause of creation, sustenance and annihilation in the names of Brahma, Visnu and Siva.

40. Brahma stays in Brahmaloka, Visnu in the milk ocean, Siva in Kailasa, all these are the attributes of Siva.

41. The primordial nature, born of Siva, maintains threefold forms in the creative activity, partially out of sport with diverse digits.

42. Vani, the deity presiding over the activity of speech, is born of his mouth; Lakshmi, in the form of riches, is born out of his chest.

43. Parvati manifested herself in the splendours of the gods. After killing all the demons she granted riches and glory to the gods.

44. In another Kalpa she was born of the womb of Dak$a’s wife. Her name was Sati. She attained Siva. Dak$a gave her to Him.

45. By her Yogic power she cast off her body on hearing

# 6

Sioapurdna about the insult to her husband. She is now born of you in the womb of Mena.

# 46.

This Parvati is the wife of Siva in every birth. In every Kalpa she is the great cosmic intellect, mother of wise men.

# 47.

She is victorious always in the form of Siddha, the bestower of Siddhi (achievement) and is Siddhi personified. Siva carefully preserves the bones and ashes from the funeral pyre of Sati.

# 48.

Hence, you give your daughter, this gentle lady to Siva out of your own free will. Otherwise she will herself go and surrender herself as his beloved wife.

# 49.

Taking the firm decision on seeing her innumerable sufferings He came to the place of your daughter’s penance in the guise of a brahmin.

# 50.

After consoling her and granting her the boon He returned to His abode. It was for complying with her request that Siva requested you for the hand of Siva, O mountain.

# 51.

Both of you had accepted the proposal as you were drawn by devotion to Siva. O lord of mountains, how is it that your mind has taken a somersault now? Please tell me.

# 52.

On being requested by the gods, the lord has sent us, the sages and Arundhati to you.

# 53.

O mountain, we instruct you plainly. By giving Parvati to Siva you will meet with great bliss.

# 54.

O lord of mountains, even if you do not give Parvati to Siva out of your own free will, their marriage will take place as a result of the inexorable workings of fate.

# 55.

O dear one, Siva has already granted Parvati the boon at the time of her penance. A promise of Siva cannot be turned topsyturvy.

# 56.

Oh! even the promise of ordinary good men acting under the guidance of Siva cannot be transgressed in all the worlds. O mountain, what then about that of Siva Himself.

# 57.

Working singlehanded, Lord Indra chopped off the wings of mountains as though at play. Parvati too sportively broke the peak of Meru.

Rudrasarhhitd 613

58. All riches can be sacrificed, O lord of mountains, for the sake of a single entity, but the eternal Sruti has it that one should forsake a single entity for the sake of a unit.

59. When danger was imminent at the hands of a brahmin, the chief of kings, Anaranya, saved his entire asset by giving his daughter to him.

60. When he was threatened by the curse of brahmin his preceptors, wise kinsmen and people well-versed in the science of polity advised him hastily.

61. O king of mountains, you too save your kinsmen by giving your daughter to Siva. You can claim thus the gods too to your side.

Brahmd said:

62. On hearing the words of Vasistha, Himavat, with a dejected heart but laughing outwardly asked him about the details of the story of the king.

Himavat said —

63. O brahmin, what is the race to which the king Anaranya belonged? How did he save his assets by giving his daughter?

Brahmd said:

64. On hearing these words of the mountain, Vasistha became glad and told him the details of the interesting story of the king.

# CHAPTER THIRTYFOUR

# (The Story of Anaranya)

Vasiftha said:

1. The king Anaranya hailed from the race of the fourteenth Manu Indrasavami.

57. According to SP. RS. Section III ch. 34. the King Anarapya belonged to the lineage of the fourteenth Manu called Indra-S&#x26;varpi. He is said to have performed a hundred horse-sacrifices with Bhfgu as his officiating priest but did not accept Indra-hood.

# Sivapur&#x26;na

2. The great king Anaranya, born of Mangalaranya* was very strong. He was a special devotee of Siva and ruled over the seven continents 58.

3. Having Bhfgu as his priest he performed a hundred sacrifices. He did not accept the position of Indra even when offered by the gods.

4. O Himavat, hundred sons were born to him and a beautiful daughter Padma who was equal to Laksmi.

5. O excellent mountain, he was more fond of his daughter than of his hundred sons.

6. He had five queens who were endowed with great qualities and fortunes and were loved by him over and above his life.

7. The girl entered the prime of her youth in her father's palace. The king issued letters of invitation for the requisition of good bridegrooms.

8. In the meantime the sage Pippalada eagerly hastening back to his hermitage saw a certain Gandharva in an isolated place in the penance-grove.

9. The Gandharva was an expert in the science of erotics. He was in the company of a woman. He was therefore completely submerged in the ocean of pleasure, sexual dalliance and was lusty.

10. On seeing him the great sage became very lustful. He lost interest in penance and began to think of acquiring a wife.

11. Thus the good sage spent a long time with his mind utterly agitated by pangs of love.

12. Once while the good sage was on his way to the river Pu$pabhadra** for taking his bath he happened to see the young maiden Padma who was as charming as goddess Laksmi.

13. The sage asked the persons standing by— “Who is this girl ?'* The people, afraid of the curse bowed to the sage and replied.

Contrast Pargiter AIHS PP. 14}, 246. Anaranya was born of Sambhuia.

It has not been possible to identify this river. number 58. It is a division of the terrestrial world. The of these divisions varies according to different authorities. It is usually seven. These are situated round the mountain Meru like the petals of a lotus flower and each being separated from the other by a distinct ocean. The central one is Jambudvlpa in which is included Bharata Khapd* (India).

# Rudrasarhhitd

The people said:

14. This excellent lady, the repository of all good qualities, is the daughter of Anaranya and is called Padma. She is another Laksmi (goddess of fortune). She is being wooed by great kings.

Brahmd said:

15. On hearing the words of the people who spoke the truth, the sage became much agitated in the mind and was eager to possess her.

16. O mountain, the sage took bath and worshipped his favourite deity Siva duly. The lustful sage went to the council-chamber of Anaranya for the sake of alms.

17. Immediately after seeing the sage, the king was struck with awe and bowed to him. He offered him homage (Madhuparka)* and devoutly worshipped him.

18. Out of love, the sage accepted everything and ultimately requested for the hand of his daughter. The king kept being unable to give any — quiet, to decisive reply.

19. The sage repeated his request saying “O great king*, give me your daughter. Otherwise in a trice I will reduce everything to ashes”.

20. The king and his attendants were overwhelmed by the splendour of the sage. Staring at the old emaciated brahmin, they began to cry.

21. The queens, knowing not what shall be done, lamented. The chief queen, the mother of the girl, fell unconscious in the excess of her grief.

22. The brothers of the girl were agitated with sorrow. Lord of mountains, everything and everyone connected with the king was overwhelmed with grief.

23. In the meantime the wise brahmin, the excellent preceptor of the king, as well as his intelligent priest came there.

24. The king bowed to them and paid homage. He cried before them. He explained to them everything and asked them what was the proper step to be taken immediately.

*See Note ^7 P. 600

# 25-26.

The brahmin, the preceptor of the king and the scholarly priest were experts in sacred lore and polity. They advised the king in that matter.

# 27.

The preceptor and the priest said: O wise king, listen to our beneficial words. Do not be anxious. In the company of your kinsmen turn your good attention to the sacred texts.

# 28.

O king, whether today or after a year, the princess is to be given to a deserving person, a brahmin or anyone else.

# 29.

In the three worlds we do not see more deserving person than this brahmin. Give your daughter to this sage and save your riches.

# 30.

O king, if all riches face the danger of destruction due to one object or person, the wise man saves everything by abandoning that object or person unless it be that who has sought refuge.

# 31.

Vasiftha said: On hearing the words of the wise, the king lamented again and again but ultimately offered his daughter fully bedecked in ornaments to the excellent sage.

# 32.

O mountain, accepting and marrying the beautiful maiden Padma, on a par with goddess Laksmi, in accordance with holy laws, the delighted sage returned to his abode.

# 33.

After giving his daughter to an old man, the king was much dejected in mind. Abandoning everything he went to the forest for performing penance.

# 34.

O mountain, when the king went to the forest, the queen passed away, due to the pangs of separation from her husband and daughter.

# 35.

Without the king, the respectable sons and officers of the king became unconscious. The other people thinking that the king was dead lamented much.

# 36.

Anaranya went to the forest, performed great penance, and worshipped Siva with devotion. In the end, he attained Sivaloka free from all ailments.

# 37.

The eldest son of the king, Kirtiman, virtuously ruled over the kingdom and tended the subjects like his own children.

Rudrasarhhita 617

38. Thus, O mountain, I have narrated to you the auspicious story of Anaranya, how he saved his race and his wealth by offering his daughter to the sage.

39. O king of mountains, you too, give your daughter to Siva, save the entire family and keep even the gods under your control.

# CHAPTER THIRTYF1VE

# (The story of Padmd and Pippaldda)

Ndrada said: —

1. O dear, what did the excellent mountain do after hearing the anecdote of Anaranya and the marriage of his daughter? Please tell me.

Brahma said: —

2. After hearing the story of Anaranya including the anecdote of the offer of his daughter, the lord of mountains again asked Vasi$tha with palms joined in reverence. The lord of mountains said:

3. O leading sage Vasisjha, O son of Brahma, O merciful one, you have narrated the wonderful story of Anaranya.

4. What did Padma, the daughter of Anaranya, do after marrying sage Pippalada? Please mention her story fully.

Vast$ha said:

5-6. The very old and venerable sage Pippalada returned to his hermitage along with his wife Padma and passed time in pleasure. He was not too much sensuous. He continued to perform his penance and holy rites in the forest and on the mountain.

7. The daughter of Anaranya served the sage devoutly physically, mentally and verbally like Lak§ml serving Visnu.

8. Once Dharma (Virtue) assumed the guise of a king by his magical power and happened to see on the way that lady of gentle smiles going to the celestial river for her holy dip.

9-10. The lord Dharma was seated in a beautiful chariot studded with gems. He was bedecked in many kinds of ornaments. He was in the prime of fresh youth, glorious and lustrous like the cupid. On seeing Padma he spoke thus, in order to know the innermost feelings of the sage’s wife, Dharma said:

11-0 beautiful woman, you are Lak§mi herself; you are charming, you are worthy of a king; you are in the very prime of youth; you will be ever young; you are a lovely sweet lady. I am telling you the truth, O slender-limbed lady.

12. You lack lustre and colour in the presence of the sage Pippalada who is old and weak.

13. Cast off that ruthless old brahmin always engaged in penances. Look up to me a great king, heroic in sexual dalliance and agitated by Kama.

14. A beautiful woman acquires beauty as a result of the merit of a previous birth. The beauty becomes completely fruitful only after embracing a man of aesthetic taste.

15. I am the lover of a thousand beautiful women. I am an expert in the erotic science and literature. Abandon that husband and make me your slave.

16. You can indulge in sexual dalliance in the beautiful secluded forests, mountains and banks of rivers in my company. Make your life fruitful.

Vatiffha said:

17. Saying this, he got down and was eager to catch her hands. The chaste lady then addressed him thus.

Padma said:

18. Away, away, go away you sinful king. If you cast your lustful ogles at me you will be doomed in a trice.

19. How can I resort to you, lecherous and mad after women, after forsaking the excellent sage Pippalada whose body is sanctified by austerities?

20. By the very touch of a person under the influence of women all merits are destroyed. He is a great sinner. His very sight promotes sins.

21. Even if he performs holy rites, a person succumbing to the viles of women is always impure. The manes, the gods and all men despise him.

22. Of what avail is knowledge, penance, repetition of sacred mantras, sacrifice, adoration, learning and charitable gift to him who is henpecked?

23. Since you spoke to me viewing me with the feelings that I am your wife although I ought to have been viewed as your mother, you will have a gradual decline as a result of my curse.

Vasiffha Said:

24. On hearing the curse of the chaste woman, O lord of mountains, Dharma cast off the guise of a king and assumed his real form. Tremblingly he spoke thus.

Dharma said:

25. O mother, know me as Dharma elderly and venerable to men of wisdom and preceptors. O chaste lady, I always consider other’s wives as mothers.

26. It was to know your innermost feelings that I approached you. I knew your mind, still I was urged by fate.

27. Only proper suppression, not the contrary, is carried out by you. Chastisement of those who go astray from the right path is carried out by Siva Himself.

28. Obeisance to Siva who distributes happiness, misery, boons, prosperity or adversity on all.

29. Obeisance to Siva who can make people enemies or friends, create affection or quarrel, to generate or destroy things.

Padma said:

# 35.

O Dharma, you are the ever present witness of all activities. O lord, why did you deign to deceive me to know my mind?

# 36.

O Dharma, what has been done already does not amount to any guilt on my part. You have been cursed in vain by me but it was due to my ignorance and innate nature of woman.

# 37.

I am now thinking as to what shall be done about it. May that idea strike me whereby I may get peace.

# 38.

This sky, these quarters and the winds may get destroyed but the curse of a chaste lady will never be destroyed. In the Satyayuga you shine with the king of gods, on all occasions, day or night, like the moon on a full moon night.

If you are destroyed, the annihilation of all creations will occur. But a sense of helpless despair is unnecessary. So I shall explain.

In the Tretayuga, one leg shall be defunct, excellent god. Another leg too shall be defunct in Dvapara and the third one in the Kali age, O lord.

In the latter half of Kali, all the legs will be chopped off. Again in the Satyayuga you will attain perfection.

38. The divine Bhuta attendants were crores and crores in number. They shone in diverse forms.

39. Accompanied by them Candi of deformed face went ahead gladly and enthusiastically. She was equally competent to please and to harass.

40. All the Ganas of Siva numbering to eleven crores, terrible but favourites of Siva were kept by her far behind.

41. The loud sounds of Damarus, the Jhankara sound of the Bherls and the sound of the conches pervaded all the three worlds.

42. The tumultuous sound of the Dundubhis rose up in the air blessing the universe auspiciously and destroying everything other than auspicious.

43. O sage, behind the Ganas, the enthusiastic gods, the Siddhas, the guardians of the quarters and others followed.

44. O sage, Visnu, seated on Garu^a and going in the middle of the group shone with the great umbrella held aloft.

46-47. I too shone well on the way with the Vedas, Sastras, Puranas and Agamas personified and along with my sons, Prajapatis, Sanaka and other Siddhas. I was eager in rendering service to Siva.

# CHAPTER FORTYONE

# (Description of the Altar- Structure)

Brahma said: —

1. Then after mutual consultation and getting Siva’s permission, O sage, Visnu sent you ahead to the abode of the mountain.
2. Urged by Visnu, Narada, you bowed to lord Siva and went ahead of all to the abode of Himavat.
3. O sage, after going there, you saw your own image made by Visvakarman and were surprised. You were a bit ashamed too.
4. O great sage, tired of seeing the portrayal of yourself, you became engaged in seeing the other builds of Visvakarman.
5. You entered the great altar of Himavat, studded with various gems and decorated with gold pots and stumps of plantain trees.
6. It had a thousand columns. It was wonderful. O sage, you were struck with surprise on seeing the altars.
7. Then you were a bit confused and greatly bewildered. O You spoke to the lord of mountains thus.
8. lord of mountains, tell me the truth. Has lord Siva seated on his bull and surrounded by his Ganas come already for the marriage? Have the gods with Vi$nu



---


644 Siuapur&#x26;na and others at their head, the sages, the Siddhas and the secondary gods come already?

Brahma said:

10. On hearing your words full of surprise, O sage, the mountain Himavat told you the truth.

Himavat said:

11. O Narada. O highly intelligent one, Siva with the marriage party has not come till now for the purpose of marrying Parvatl.

12. O Narada, know that all these things have been portrayed by ViSvakarman. O celestial sage, shake off your bewilderment. Be calm. Remember Siva.

13. Showing kindness to me you take your food and rest for a while. Then gladly accompany Mainaka and others to Siva’s presence.

14. Accompanied by these mountains you request Siva along with the gods, and the great sages, Siva whose sprout-like feet are worshipped by gods and demons. Bring them here.

Brahma said:

15. You accepted the suggestion noble-heartedly and performed the duties there. Then accompanied by the sons of the mountain and others you went to Siva’s presence.

16. There the brilliant god Siva surrounded by the gods and others was seen and bowed to by you and the mountains with devotion.

17. Then all the gods including Indra, Visnu and me and Siva’s attendants asked you, O sage.

18. They had been struck with surprise and suspicion on seeing the mountains Mainaka, Sahya, Meru and others bedecked in all kinds of ornaments.

The gods said:

19. O Narada, intelligent one, you appear to be bewildered. Have you been duly honoured by Himavat or not? Tell us in detail.

20. Why have these excellent mountains Mainaka,

# Rudrasarhhiti

645

Sahya, Meru and others highly bedecked and of great valour, come here?

21. O Narada, does the mountain really intend to give his daughter to Siva or not? What is it that is taking place in the abode of Himavat now? Please tell us.

22. We are having doubts in our minds. Hence we, the heaven-dwellers, ask you. Please say everything, O righteous one, and dispel our suspicions.

Brahma said:

23. On hearing these words of Visnu and other heaven-dwellers, O sage, you who had been fascinated by the magic of Tva?tr (Visvakarman) spoke to them.

24. Going to an isolated place, O sage, you spoke these words to me, to Visnu and also to Indra who is the lord of gods and a former enemy of the mountains, having cut off their wings.100

Ndrada said:

25. The distorted portrayal of heaven-dwellers is something enchanting. He desires to delude the gods in a loving but cunning manner.

26. O lord of Saci, have you forgotten everything? Formerly you had deluded him. Hence he wishes to surpass you here in the abode of the mountain of noble heart.

27. I have been fascinated by my shining portrait. Vi?nu, Brahma and Indra have been realistically portrayed by him. O of gods, why should too much lord I talk?

28. He has made artificial prototypes of all the gods. No one, not a single detail, has been left out.

29. It is for the purpose of particularly enchanting the gods that this spell has been employed by him through this caricature.

Brahma said:

30. On hearing your words lord Indra who was fright-

tencd from head to foot, immediately spoke to Vi$nu. Lord Indra said:

31. O lord of Laksmi, O lord of gods. Tvasjr who is agitated due to the grief over his son will surely kill me under this pretext and not otherwise.

Brahmd said:

32. On hearing his words Visnu, the lord of gods laughingly consoled Indra by speaking thus.

Vijnu said:

33. O lord of Sac!, formerly you had been enchanted by the demons Nivatakavacas, your previous enemies, by the power of their great spell.

34. O Indra, at my instance, this mountain Himavat and others too were rendered wingless.

35. Let the mountains now create magic on remembering that and wish to surpass us foolishly. We are not to be afraid of our enemies.

36. O Indra, Siva favourably disposed to His devotees, will undoubtedly look to our welfare.

37. While he was speaking this to Indra of agitated mind, Siva spoke to Visnu following the worldly custom. Siva said:

38. “O Visnu, O lord of gods, what are you speaking to each other? O sage, after speaking thus to them Siva addressed you.

39. “O Narada, what does the great mountain say? Tell me the truth with details. You must not keep any secret.

40. Does the mountain want to give the daughter or not? Tell me that quickly. O dear one, on going there, what did you see? What did you do? Tell me that quickly.

Brahmd said:

41. Addressed thus by Siva, O sage, you endowed with divine vision told him secretly what you saw in the altar.

Ndrada said:

42. O O great lord, lord of gods; listen to my auspicious words. Lord, there is no fear of any hindrance in the celebration of marriage.

43. The lord of mountains will surely give his daughter to you. It is certainly to take you there that these mountains have come here.

44. But to delude the gods a wonderful spell has been created. O omniscient, it is only to inspire curiosity. There is no possibility of any obstacle.

45. O lord, Visvakarman, a great expert in creating illusion has constructed a peculiar altar in his house at his instance. It is full of surprising things.

46. A fascinating assembly of gods has been built there. On seeing it I was deluded by his skill and was struck with surprise.

Brahma said:

47. O dear, on hearing your words, the lord Siva following the worldly convention, laughingly spoke to Visnu and other gods.

Siva said:

48. O Visnu, if the mountain Himavat gives his daughter to me, what have I to do with this spell? Speak to me what is true.

49. O Brahma, O Indra, sages, O gods, speak truly. What have I to do with the spell if the mountain gives his daughter?

50. It is held by scholars, knowing cogent reasons, that somehow or other the fruit should be achieved. Hence you, with Visnu at the head, will hasten seeking only the task on hand.

Brahma said:

51. Discussing thus with gods, Siva appeared to be completely overpowered by Kama like an ordinary man.

52-54. At the bidding of Siva, Visnu and other gods, the noble sages and others, O sage, kept you and mountains at the head and started for the abode of Himavat. They

hands. Visnu was standing to the left, Brahma to the right, Indra at his back. Behind on either side, the gods were standing. He was being eulogised by the gods and others. He looked benevolent to the people. Being one He had assumed different physical bodies for his own reasons. He was Brahman itself, the lord of all and the bestower of boons. He was both with or without attributes, subservient to the devotees, merciful, greater than primordial Being and primordial nature, Existence, Knowledge and Bliss itself.

15. The mountain saw Visnu, bedecked in ornaments and seated on Garuda to the right of lord Siva.

16. O sage, to the left of the lord stood I, the four-faced deity, shining brilliantly and accompanied by my attendants.

17. On seeing us both, great favourites of Siva for ever, the lord of mountains with all his retinue respectfully bowed to us.

18. Similarly, on seeing the gods and others brilliantly shining behind lord Siva and at his sides, the lord of mountains bowed to them.

19. At the bidding of Siva the mountain went ahead to his city. Behind him went Visnu, Brahma, the sages and the gods. O Narada, the gods and others accompanying the lord, praised the city of Himavat with great delight.

20. Stationing the gods and others on his beautiful summit specially arranged for them, Himavat went to the place where the altar for the rites had been erected.

21. After causing squares and quadrangles to be made with festoons, he performed the ceremonial ablutions, gave charitable gifts and supervised everything.

22. Then he sent his sons to Siva accompanied by all his attendants and followers, Visnu and others.

23. The extremely delighted lord of mountains in the company of his kinsmen desired to perform the reception to the bridegroom with great pomp and ceremony.

26. The sons of the mountain came back to their abode with his permission and informed the king of mountains gladly that the bridegroom and the party were on their way there.

27. O sage, on hearing the request thus made, Vi?nu and other gods with the lord rejoiced much.

Mend said:

1. O sage, I shall first see the bridegroom of Parvatl. Let me have an idea of the form and features of Siva for which she performed the great penance.

Brahma said:

2. Thus, urged by ignorance, O sage, she went to the terrace along with you to see Siva.

3. Then Siva, realising her false pride in herself, spoke to Vi$nu and me as a part of His wonderful sport. Siva said:

4. "At my bidding, O dear ones, both of you go one by one accompanied by the gods to the threshold of the mountain. I shall follow afterwards."

Brahmd said:

5. On hearing it Vi?nu called all and told them of his suggestion. The gods then walked in accordance with that suggestion enthusiastically.

6. O sage, the lord of the universe, let Mena stand on the terrace and see the procession along with you in order to make her mind confused.

7. In the meantime, seeing the splendid vast army, sage, Mena became delighted as usual.

8. At the head of the procession came the beautiful fastidious Gandharvas, dressed in rich clothes and bedecked in fine ornaments.

9. They rode on different vehicles. They played on musical instruments. Flags and banners of various colours and sizes fluttered on their chariots. The heavenly nymphs accompanied them.

10. On seeing Vasu, the lord of Vasus, along with Vasus, Mena became delighted and exclaimed — “O this is Siva”.

11. O excellent sage, you told her “These are only the attendants of Siva. This is not Siva, the bridegroom.”

12. On hearing this, Mena fell athinking “A person greater than this! Ha, how will he be!”

13. In the meantime she saw Manigriva, the other Yak?as and their vast army with twice the splendour of Vasus.

14. On seeing the lustrous Manigriva the lord of Yak?as, Mena was delighted and said — “This is Siva, the bridegroom of Parvati.”

15. “This is not Siva, the bridegroom of Parvati. He is only an attendant of Siva” said you to Mena, the wife of the mountain. By that time the god of fire passed by.

said “This is Siva, the bridegroom of Parvati” but you said “No”.

17. By that time Yama passed by with twice the splendour of the previous one. On seeing him delighted Mena exclaimed “This is Siva”.

18. “No” said you. By that time Nirrti, the lord of Punyajanas, passed by having twice the splendour of Yama.

19. On seeing him the delighted Mena said “This is Siva”. “No” said you to her. By that time Varuna passed that way.

20. On seeing his splendour twice that of Nirrti, she said “This is Siva, the bridegroom of Parvati”. But you said “No”.

21. By that time Vayu passed by with twice the splendour of Varuna. On seeing him the delighted Mena said “This is Siva”.

22. “No” said you. By that time Kubera, the lord of Guhyakas, passed by with twice the splendour of Vayu.

30. On seeing Brhaspati in their midst Menaka

Rvdrasarhhiti 653 said: — “This is Siva the master of Parvati”. Then you said “No”.

31. By that time Brahma passed by. He was in an excellent form of lustre, praised by excellent sages and looking like an embodied Dharma itself.

32. O sage, seeing me the highly delighted Mena said “This is Parvati’s husband”. You said to her “No”.

33-35. In the meantime lord Visnu came that way. He looked glorious and splendid, dark-blue like the fresh cloud and having four arms. He had the handsome features of numberless cupids. He wore yellow garments. He was the king of heaven with eyes resembling the petals of a lotus, and looked very calm. He had Garuda as his vehicle. He possessed all the characteristic signs conch etc. He was bedecked in crown and other ornaments. He wore Srivatsa on his chest. He had an uncommon splendour that was incomprehensible.

36. On seeing him Mena’s eyes became dazed. With great delight she said—ft This is Siva himself the bridegroom of Parvati. There is no doubt about it.

37-39. On hearing Menaka’s words you said No, this is not the lord, the cause of protection and enjoyment. This is not the bridegroom of Parvati. This is Visnu, the officer-in-charge of the marriage-party of Siva and a great favourite of Siva. The bridegroom Siva is better than him. O Mena, it is impossible for me to describe his beauty. He is the lord of the entire universe, the lord of all, the Self-Emperor.”

Brahma said:

40. On hearing your words, Mena thought her daughter auspicious, rich, fortunate and harbinger of happiness for the three families.

41. Her face was beaming with pleasure and her heart was delighted. Frequently congratulating herself on her good luck she said.

Mend said:

43. Her would-be-husband is the lord of these leaders of great lustre whom I have seen now.

44. How can I describe her good luck even in hundred years? It is impossible to describe it when I see the lustre of these leaders.

Brahmd said:

45. Thus spoke Mena with her mind full of love and hope. By that time Siva, the wonderful source of enjoyment and protection, came that way.

46. He showed Himself in his real form free from change of illusion. dear, the Ganas of wonderful forms proved to be the dispeller of Mena's pride.

47. O sage Narada, on seeing Him come, you lovingly pointed him out to her as the bridegroom of Siva and spoke to her.

Narada said:

48. This is Siva Himself, O comely maiden, see. It was for him that Parvati performed a great penance in the forest.

Brahma# said:

49. Thus addressed by you the delighted Mena stared at the lord with joy; the lord Isana of wonderful features and of wonderful attendants.

50. Immediately the army of Siva came there consisting of wonderful arrays of Bhutas, Pretas and Ganas.

51. Some were in the form of violent gusts of wind, producing hissing sounds with waving flags. Some had crooked faces. Others were deformed.

52. Some were awful with overgrown moustaches and beards. Some were lame. Some were blind. Some held staffs and nooses and some great iron clubs in their hands.

56. Such and other innumerable deformed Ganas, heroic and terrible, strong and strenuous passed by, O dear.

57. O sage, you pointed out Ganas of Siva here with your finger and said to the lovely lady, “see the attendants of Siva and Siva Himself.”

58. O sage, on seeing the innumerable Ganas, Bhutas and Prctas, Menaka was terribly frightened instantaneously.

59-61. On seeing Siva in their midst, the mother of Parvati trembled. She saw Siva who though devoid of attributes was better than those who had all the attributes. He was seated on the Bull. He had five faces and three eyes. He had ashes smeared over the body. He had matted hair with the crescent moon on His head. He had ten hands with the skull in one of them. His upper cloth was tiger’s hide. He held the bow Pinaka in one of his hands and the Trident in another. He had odd eyes, ugly features utterly dishevelled and untidy. He wore the hide of an elephant.

62. She was stunned, tremulous, agitated and confused. You said to her “This is Siva” and pointed Him out to her.

63. On hearing your words she fell on the ground like a tender creeper blown by the wind. Mena the chaste lady was grief-stricken.

64. “What is this? I have been deceived for being too ambitious. Of what use is it to see this deformity?” Saying this, Menaka fell unconscious there in a trice.

Brahmd said: —

1-2. On regaining consciousness, the chaste beloved of the mountain lamented with great agitation and began to rebuke everyone. In faltering words she frequently censured her sons at first and then scolded her daughter.

Mend said: —

3. O sage, formerly it was mentioned by you that Parvati would marry Siva. Afterwards you assigned some activity of worship to Himavat.

4. Its fruit is visible now, to be sure. But it is adverse and meaningless. O sage, O wicked minded one, I the innocent woman have been cheated by you by all means.

5. The fruit of penance which she performed and which is very difficult even for the sages to perform, has been this, painful to every onlooker.

6. What shall I do? Where shall I go? Who will dispel my sorrow? My family is wrecked. My life is doomed.

7. Where are those so called celestial sages? I shall pluck out their beards. Where is that mischievous woman who came here by herself in the guise of the wife of one of them?

8. By whose guilt have I been ruined now?” Saying this she turned to her daughter and began to say harsh words.

9. O wretched daughter, what is it that you have done? This is extremely painful to me. You have given gold and brought a glass piece, O wicked girl.

10. You have cast away sandal paste and smeared yourself with mud. You have driven away the swan and have held a crow in your hands.

11. Setting aside the sacred river water you have drunk the well-water. Losing the sun you have clung to the glowworm in all earnestness.

12. Throwing away cooked rice you have eaten the

14. O daughter, casting off the holy sacrificial ashes at home you have taken the inauspicious ashes from the funeral pyre.

15. Abandoning the great lords, Visnu and others you have performed penance for Siva. Your intellect has really gone astray.

16. Fie on you. Fie on your intellect. Fie on your beauty and conduct. Fie on your adviser. Fie on your maids too.

17. Fie on us who brought you thus to the world, daughter. O Narada, fie on your intelligence and fie on those seven sages who gave us wrong advice.

18. Fie on the whole family. Fie on the efficiency in performing the rites. Fie on everything done by you. You have inflamed this household. Almost it has been a death blow to me.

19. Let not the king of the mountains come near me. Let not the seven sages show their faces to me.

20. Has anything been achieved? Our whole race is wrecked by all conspiring together. How is it that I have not remained a barren woman? How is it that a miscarriage did not take place when I conceived?

21. How is it that I did not die? How is it that this girl did not die? Why is she not devoured by the demons and others from the sky?

Brahma said:

40. Then Himacala himself came there extremely agitated. In order to convince her he spoke lovingly pointing to her the reality of the situation.

Hirfidcala said:

41. O beloved Mena, listen to my words. How is it that you have become dispirited? How many important persons have come to our abode! And you are insulting them!

42. You do not know Siva. Siva has many names and many forms. Seeing a peculiar distorted form you have become excited.

43. He has been realised by me. He is the protector of everyone. He is worthy of worship of the most adorable. He can bless and countermand. O

44. Do not be obstinate. faultless beloved, do not be grief-stricken. Get up. Hasten. O virtuous one, carry on your duties.

45. Let me remind you of a former incident when Siva came to our place in a hideous form and exhibited his sports.

46. But on seeing his greatness we both consented to give our daughter in marriage to him. O beloved, keep that promise.

Brahmd said:

# 47.

After saying thus, the lord of the mountains stopped, sage. On hearing it Mena, the mother of Siva, spoke to Himavat.

# Mena said:

# 48-50.

“O lord, let my words be heard. You can carry out what I say. Take your daughter Parvati, tie her up and cast her down into a deep abysmal chasm. Or drown her in the deep sea and be happy. I am not going to give her to Siva. If you give your daughter to him who is of hideous features, O lord, I shall certainly leave off this mortal frame.

Brahmd said —

# 51.

When these words were spoken by Mena in her obduracy, Parvati voluntarily spoke in a sweet voice.

# Parvati said:

# 52.

“O mother, your noble intellect has become perverted. Why do you forsake virtue, you who ought to depend on virtue alone?

# 53.

This Siva has no one else greater than him. He is Siva, the source of everything. He is beautiful, pleasing and eulogised in all the Vedas.

# 54.

Siva is the benefactor. He is the lord of gods. He is self-ruler. O mother, He is of many forms and names. He is served by Visnu, Brahma and others.

# 55.

He is the support of everything. He is the creator and annihilator. He is free from aberrations. He is the lord of the three deities. He is indestructible and eternal.

# 56.

It is for him that all the gods, as attendants, have come here. They stand in a festive mood at your threshold. What more pleasure do you need?

# 57.

Hence get up. Endeavour to make your life fruitful. Give me to Siva. Make my effort meaningful.

my58. O mother, give me to lord Siva. O mother, agree to humble entreaty. I request you.

59. If you do not give me to Siva, I am not going to woo anyone else. How can a jackal, the cunning cheat, seize the share of the lion?

60. O mother, Siva has been wooed, yes, wooed by me mentally, verbally, and physically. You can do what you please.

Brahma said:

61-62. On hearing these words of Parvati, Mena, the beloved of the lord of mountains lamented much. She became angry. She caught hold of Parvati and thrashed her with fists, elbows gnashing her teeth. She was greatly agitated and furious.

63. O dear one, O sage, you and other sages who were there, separated her from the mother and took her far off.

64. Mena then rebuked them again and again. She hurled harsh repulsive words at all of them.

Mend said:

65. See what I will do to Parvati of evil inclination. I will give her deadly poison or I will push her down in a deep well.

66. Or I will cut her into many pieces with weapons and arrows. Or I will drown my daughter Parvati in the deep sea.

67. Or I will certainly cast off my body. But I will never give my daughter to Siva of hideous form.

68. What an awful bridegroom has been secured by this wicked girl? The mountain and I, nay the whole family, has been made a laughing stock.

69. He has neither a mother nor a father. He has no brother, no kinsman. He has not even a fellow clansman. He has no beauty, no skill, not even a house of His own!

70. He has no good dress, no ornaments, no assistants. His vehicle is not good. He is neither rich nor even in the prime of youth.

71. He has no tidiness about him. He is not learned.

# Sivapurdna

What a repulsive body he has! What has he, on seeing which I may be tempted to give my good daughter to him?”

Brahmd said:

1. O sage she lamented thus and in many a similar manner she cried in the excess of her grief.
2. Then I came there quickly and narrated to her the principles of Siva which ought to have dispelled her perverted knowledge.
3. “O Mena, you shall listen lovingly to my auspicious words whereby your evil inclination shall cease.
4. Siva is the creator, sustainer and annihilator of the universe. You do not know His real form. Wherefore do you then seek sorrow?
5. The lord has several forms and names. He indulges in many kinds of divine sports. He is the lord of all and independent. He is the master of delusion and free from doubtful alternatives.
6. Realising this, O Mena, give your daughter to Siva. Abandon your misplaced stubbornness. Your evil inclination is destructive of all affairs.”
7. Thus addressed by me Mena continued to cry again and again. Slowly, O sage, she eschewed all shame and spoke to me.

Mend said:

O Brahma, why do you render her excellent beauty futile? Why don’t you kill her yourself?
You shall not tell me again that she should be given to Siva. I will not give my daughter, dearer than my own life, to Siva.

Brahmd said:

O great sage, when she expressed thus, Sanaka and other Siddhas came there and spoke lovingly.

Siddhas said:

This Siva is the supreme being, the bestower of

supreme happiness. Out of His sympathy He has granted His vision to your daughter.

Brahmd said:

“My riches are not to be given to Siva of hideous form.

Why are you Siddhas collectively attempting to make her exquisite beauty futile?”

When this was mentioned by her I became stunned. All the gods, Siddhas, sages and human beings were bewildered.

In the meantime, on hearing of her persistent obduracy, Visnu a favourite of Siva came there and spoke as follows.

Vifnu said:

You are the beloved mental daughter of the Pitfs. You are endowed with all good qualities. You are wife of Himavat himself. Yours is the excellent race of Brahma. Your well-wishers in the world are also like him (Brahma). You are really blessed. What more can I say? You are reputed to be a patron of virtue. Why do you then eschew virtue?

May this be pondered over by you yourself. Can anything against you be mentioned by the gods, sages, or Brahma or by myself?

You do not know Siva. He is both possessed and devoid of attributes. He is hideous as well as comely. He is worthy of worship by all. He is the ultimate goal of the good.

The primordial nature is created by Him alone. Near her, the excellent primordial Being has also been created by Him.

Brahma and I are created thereafter. Then, with the three attributes, Siva Himself, incarnated in order to be beneficial to the worlds.

The Vedas originated from Him. The gods sprang up from Him. Whatever mobile and immobile there is in the universe, sprang up from him.

Wh6 has described His form? By whom can it be

95. Whatever is seen in the universe from Brahma down to a blade of grass is identical with Siva. Know it. There need not be any hesitation in this matter.

96. He alone, in the course of his divine sport, has incarnated himself in divine form. It was by the fascination of Parvati’s penance that He has come to your threshold.

97. Hence, O wife of Himavat, eschew your sorrow. Worship Siva. You will have great pleasure. All pain will be quelled.

Brahma said:

98. O sage, when instructed by Visnu, Menaka’s mind was somewhat softened.

99. But she did not give up her obduracy. She did not consent to the proposal of giving her daughter to Siva. Mena was deluded by Siva’s magic.

100. On hearing the pleasing words of Visnu, the beloved of the mountain, the mother of Parvati became slightly enlightened and spoke to Visnu.

101. If He assumes a lovely form and body my daughter may be given to Him and not otherwise even if you attempt it a thousand times. This is my firm decision.

102. After saying thus Mena of steady resolve kept quiet. She was induced by Siva’s will whose magical power deludes all.

# CHAPTER FORTYFIVE

# (Siva's comely form and the Jubilation of the Citizens)

Brahma said:

1. In the meantime, O sage, urged by Visnu you went immediately to Siva to conciliate Him.

2. After reaching there, with a desire to get the task of the gods fulfilled, you pleaded with Siva after eulogising Him with different kinds of hymns.

3. On hearing your words Siva joyously assumed a wonderfully excellent and divine form and showed His mercifulness.

4. O sage, on seeing the comely form of Siva, the receptacle of exquisite beauty, far better than that of the cupid, you were greatly delighted.

5. Highly delighted you eulogised Him again and again with different kinds of hymns and returned to the place where Mena was seated along with other gods.

6. Reaching there, O sage, with great affection and delight, you spoke to the great pleasure of Mena, the wife of Himavat.

Ndrada said:

7. O Mena of wide eyes, see the excellent features of Siva. The merciful Siva has taken great pity on us.

Brahma said:

8. Extremely surprised on hearing your words, Mena the beloved wife of the mountain, saw Siva’s form that afforded great bliss.

9-12. It was as refulgent as that of a thousand suns. Every part of the body was exquisite. The garments were of variegated colours. He was embellished with different ornaments. He was smiling with great delight. His comeliness was highly pleasing. He was fair-complexioned and lustrous. The crescent moon added to his beauty. Visnu and other gods lovingly served Him. The sun acted as His royal umbrella. The moon embellished Him. In every way He was extremely handsome bedecked in ornaments. It was impossible to describe adequately the great beauty of His vehicle.

13. The Ganga and the Yamuna were waving the Chowries. The eight Siddhis danced in front of Him.

14. Visnu, I, Indra and the other gods bedecked their bodies and dress and accompanied Siva.

15. The Ganas of various forms and features shouted.

105. The eightfold Siddhis are personified here. For details see Note 203 P. 235.

16. The Siddhas, the secondary gods, the extremely delighted sages went in company of Siva. The others too were equally delighted.

17. Thus the fully decorated gods, were very jubilant and in the company of their wives they eulogised Siva, the Supreme Brahman.

18. ViSvavasu106 and others along with the celestial damsels sang songs of Siva’s glory.

19. O excellent sage, when Siva was nearing the threshold of the palace of Himavat, there was much jubilation there.

20. O excellent sage, who can describe the exquisite splendour of the supreme lord at that time.

21. On seeing Him in that form Mena stood stunned as though drawn in a picture for a moment, O sage, and spoke these words.

Mena said: —

22. O great lord, my daughter is indeed blessed, she by whom the great penance was performed. It is by virtue of that penance that you have come to my threshold.

23. O lord of Parvatl, be pleased now. Pardon me for the heap of repulsive words I showered on Siva.

Brahma said:

24. After saying thus and eulogising the moon-crested lord, Mena, the beloved of the mountain, bowed to Him with palms joined in reverence and stood shy.

25. By that time the ladies of the town left the work they were engaged in, in their eagerness to see Siva.

26. A certain lady in the midst of her bath and toilet was overwhelmed with the desire to see Siva, the bridegroom of Pârvatî. She came out with the shampoo powder still held in her hands.

106. ViSvavasu is the chief of the Gandharvas in Indra's heaven. He is a famous ipusidan and is said to possess all girls from the advent of their youth and transfer them to Agni from whom the bridegrooms obtain them for producing wealth and sons.

27. A certain lady engaged in fanning her husband in the company of her maid left that job and came out to see Siva with the fan still in her hands.

28. Another lady engaged in suckling her babe at her breast left him dissatisfied and came out eagerly to see the lord.

29. Another lady engaged in trying her waist girdle came out with it. Another lady came out with garments worn inside out.

30. Another lady left her husband who had sat down to dine and came out athirsting and enthusiastic to see the bridegroom.

31. A certain lady holding the collyrium in her hand after applying it to one of her eyes came out to see the bridegroom of the daughter of the mountain with the salve stick still in her hand.

32. Another damsel engaged in applying the red lac juice to her feet heard the tumult outside and so left it in the middle and came out to see the procession.

33. Thus the ladies forsook their activities, left their houses and came out. On seeing the exquisite form of Siva they were greatly fascinated.

34. Delighted on seeing Siva and overwhelmed by affection they cherished the comely form in their hearts and spoke as follows:

The ladies said:

35. The eyes of the residents of this town have become fruitful. The life of the persons who have seen this comely form has become meaningful.

36. The life is fruitful and the rites are fruitful only of the person who has seen Siva, the destroyer of all sins.

37. Parvati has accomplished everything inasmuch as she performed penance for Siva. She is blessed, she is contented in securing Siva as her husband.

38. If Brahma had not joined this pair, Siva and Siva, his endeavour of creation would have entirely become fruitless.

39. This is well done. The excellent pair has been united. Everything has become meaningful in every activity.

40. A vision of Siva is inaccessible to men without.

penance. All of us have now become contented by seeing Siva.

41. Just as Lakshmi was blessed by securing Vishnu as her lord, formerly, so also the gentle lady Parvati has become embellished on securing Siva.

42. Just as Sarasvati was blessed by securing Brahma as her husband, so also the gentle lady Parvati has become embellished on getting Siva as her husband.

43. All of us, men and women, are blessed we who see Siva, the lord of all, the husband of Parvati. Brahma said:

44. Saying thus they worshipped Siva with sandal paste and raw rice grains. They showered Him with fried grains respectfully.

45. The ladies standing near Mena were enthusiastically praising the good luck of Mena and the mountain.

46. Hearing the auspicious stories and anecdotes of the ladies, the lord became delighted, O sage, along with Vishnu and others.

Brahma said:

2. Mena, the exquisite beloved of Himacala, got up from her seat and went into the harem along with the womenfolk.

3. For the customary Nirajana (waving of lights) rites of Siva, the chaste lady came near the entrance with lights and vessels in her hands along with womenfolk of the sages.

Rudrasaifihitd 669 of Parvatl, served by all the gods and who by that time had come there.

5-11. Siva had the complexion of the colour of the Campaka flower. He had only one face but retained the three eyes. The face was beaming with a simple smile. He was bedecked in gems and gold and wore a garland of Malati flowers. The gemset crown was lustrous. He wore brilliant necklaces. He was bedecked in bangles and bracelets of fine workmanship. He was shining well with the two clothes of great value, fine texture and unrivalled beauty and purified in fire. Highly embellished in sandal paste, aguru, musk and fine saffron, he had a gemset mirror in his hand and his eyes were lustrous with the collyrium. He was shedding a halo around him enveloping everything. He was extremely beautiful. He appeared to be very young. His limbs had the full complement of their ornaments. He was very attractive to the ladies. He was not nervous or self-conscious. His lotuslike face had the brilliance of a thousand moons. His body shone with a refulgence more than that of a thousand cupids. He was beautiful in every limb. Seeing the lord thus as her son-in-law, Mena forgot all her grief. She was glad.

12. She praised her good luck. She congratulated Parvatl, the mountain and his entire family. She congratulated herself. She rejoiced again and again.

13. Gazing at her son-in-law joyously with beaming face, the chaste lady performed the NIrajana rite.

14. Remembering what Parvatl had told her, Mena was agreeably surprised and with a beaming lotus-like face full of delight she muttered to herself.

15. “I see the beauty of the great lord far in excess of what Parvatl had told me before.

16. Siva’s loveliness cannot be expressed adequately now. In the same state of pleasant surprise she went in.

17. The young ladies proclaimed that the daughter of the mountain was fortunate. Some girls said that she had become a goddess.

18. Some said “Such a bridegroom has never been seen, to our knowledge.” Some girls said to Mena— “Parvati is really blessed.”

22. She made formal inquiries about the health of the bridegroom and gladly went into the house. Siva went to the apartments assigned to Him along with the Ganas and the gods.

23. In the meantime the servant-maids in the harem of the mountain took Parvati out in order to worship the tutelar family deity.

24-30. There the gods saw joyously with winkless eyes the bride of dark complexion like the collyrium, and fully bedecked in ornaments in every limb. With a side glance she was respectfully looking at the three-eyed lord avoiding the eyes of others. With a gentle smile playing in her face she appeared very beautiful. Her plaited hair was thickly grown and looked beautiful. Decorative lines over her body were exquisite. She had the Tilaka with musk and saffron. Cemset necklace shone over her chest. Bracelets and bangles of gems and jewels shone brilliantly. With diamond earrings her cheeks appeared brilliant. Her rows of teeth sparkled like diamonds. Red lac applied over her lips which were naturally red like Bimba fruits was exquisite. She had a gemset mirror in her hand. A toy lotus also embellished her. Sandal paste, aguru musk and saffron were smeared over the body by her. Her feet and soles were naturally red. Tinkling anklets added to their beauty.

31. On seeing the primordial deity, the mother of the universe along with Menaka, the gods and others bowed down their heads with great devotion.

22. Indeed we are highly blessed as to witness the marriage ceremony of Siva and Parvati, highly portentous of the good fortune of all the worlds.

Brahma said:

23. Even as these confabulations were going on, the ministers of the lord of mountains came there.

24. They approached Siva, Vishnu and others and made their submission that the time for the celebration of marriage had arrived and that they would please hasten to the palace.

25. On hearing that, O sage, Vishnu and others rejoiced much and cried shouts of victory to the mountain.

26. Siva too rejoiced much eager that he was approaching Parvati but kept the signs of joy within his mind alone in a wonderfully serene manner.

27. Then the ceremonial ablution with the sacred articles of toilet was performed by the delighted trident-bearing lord eager to bless the worlds.

28. The bath being over He wore fine clothes. He was attended upon by the guardians of the quarters and surrounded by several others. He was then seated on the shoulders of the Bull.

1. In the meantime, urged by the priest Garga Himavat started the rite of marriage in the company of Mena.

2. Himavat and Mena held the gold pot on either side. Himavat was bedecked in fine clothes and ornaments.

3. The joyous mountain with the assistance of his priest wooed the bridegroom after offering water, clothes, ornaments, sandal paste etc.

4. Then the brahmins were requested by Himavat

“May the rite be formally started after narrating the Tithi etc. The auspicious hour has come.”

5. After saying “So be it”, the excellent brahmins who knew the proper time proclaimed the Tithi etc. very delightedly.

6. Then Himacala mentally urged with pleasure by lord Siva, the cause of great enjoyment, smilingly spoke to Siva.

7. “O Siva, please do not delay. Please mention your genealogy, saintly lineage, 108 family, name and your Veda along with your branch of the Vedas.”

Brahmd said:

8. On hearing these words of Himavat, Siva of sweet face, turned His face away. He without sorrow attained a pitiable plight.

9. When lord Siva stood thus unable to say anything in reply and was seen so by the gods, sages, Gandharvas, Yaksas, and Siddhas, O Narada, you did something laughable. Urged by Siva mentally O Narada, you, the knower of Brahman with mind fixed in Siva, played on your Vina.

10. You were forbidden strictly by the lord of mountains, Visnu, gods, sages and by me.

11. When at the will of Siva you did not desist from it, you were again spoken to thus by the mountain then “Do not play on the Vina now.”

12. O celestial sage, O wise one, when you were thus strenuously forbidden, you remembered Siva and spoke to the lord of the mountains.

Before the bride is given away to the bridegroom, the names of the ancestors of both the parties with Gotra and Pravara are announced loudly so that the people assembled should know that both, the bride and the bridegroom, come of good families, the pedigree of which can be traced to many generations. The ceremony is called Gotroccira in the GfhyasGtrai.

anything about Siva of whom you speak. You have no inner vision.

15. Siva was directly asked by you to mention His Gotra. On this occasion these words arc utterly ridiculous and derisible.

16. O mountain, even Visnu, Brahma and other gods do not know His Gotra, family and name. What then can be said about others?

17. It was a result of the severe penance of Parvati that Siva was seen by you, O mountain, in one day according to whose calculation a crore of Brahmas become annihilated.

18. He is the formless supreme Brahman. He is attributeless. He is greater than Primordial Nature. He has no shape, is free from aberrations. He is the master of delusion. He is greater than the greatest.

19. He has no Gotra, family or name. He is independent. He is favourably disposed to His devotees. At His will He assumes bodies taking many names. He is full of attributes.

20. He is sugotrin (having good gotra) as well as devoid of gotra. He is of noble family as well as devoid of a family. Thanks to Parvati’s penance. He has now become your son-in-law. There is no doubt about it.

21. The whole world consisting of the mobile and immobile has been deluded by Him in His divine sport. O excellent mountain, even the wisest of men does not know Him.

22. The head of lord Siva of phallic image was not seen by Brahma. Visnu who went to the nether worlds did not see His foot. How surprised he was.

23. O excellent mountain, of what avail is this talk? Siva’s magical power is inscrutable. The three worlds, Visnu, Brahma and others too are subservient to Him.

24. Hence, O father of Parvati, ponder over this deeply. No doubt need be entertained by you even slightly with respect to this bridegroom of your choice.

Know that the divine sound alone is the gotra, and family of Siva in His divine form, who assumes forms in His divine sport.

Hence, O Himacala, mentally urged by Siva, the lord of all, I played upon my lute.

Brabnd said:

# 31.

O sage, on hearing your words, Himavat, the lord of mountains was satisfied and the bewilderment in his mind vanished.

# 32.

Then Vi?nu, the other gods and the sages said "Well done, Well done". They were freed of all bewilderment.

# 33.

The shrewd people realised the majesty of lord Siva. They were pleasantly surprised and began to say to one another.

# 34.

"Siva is of the form of knowledge. He is greater than the greatest. It is at His bidding that the vast universe is born. He is of independent movement. He can be realised by the greatest concentration. He, the lord of the three worlds, is now seen by us."

# 35.

Then Meru and the excellent mountains became agitated and simultaneously spoke to Himavat, the lord of mountains.

The mountains said:

# 36.

O mountain, be firm and stand by your decision to give your daughter. If you say “No”, you stand to lose. We speak the truth. Do not hesitate. Let the girl be given to Siva.

# 37.

On hearing the words of his friends, Himavat urged by Brahma gave his daughter to Siva.

# 38.

“O lord Siva, I am giving this girl, my daughter to you as your wife. O lord of all, be pleased to accept her.”

# 39.

Himavat gave his daughter Parvati, the mother of the three worlds, to Siva the great, repeating the mantra “Tasmai Rudraya Mahate”.

# 40.

Placing the hand of Parvati in the hand of Siva the mountain rejoiced much mentally. He had the satisfaction of crossing the ocean of his ambition.

# 41.

Siva grasped the lotus-like hand of Parvati in his hand repeating the Vedic mantras. Lord Siva was greatly delighted.

# 42.

Touching the ground and showing the worldly course of action, O sage, Siva recited the mantra “Kamasya Kodat”.

# 43.

There was a great jubilation everywhere that gladdened everyone. Cries of “Victory” rose up in the heaven, the earth and the sky.

# 44.

The delighted people shouted “Well done” and “Obeisance to you”. The Gandharvas sang sweetly with pleasure. The celestial damsels danced.

# 45.

2. Siva poured offerings into the fire with Mantras from RK, Yajus and Sima Vedas. P&#x26;rvati’s brother Mainaka offered handfuls of fried grains.11

3. Then according to the worldly convention, Parvati and Siva performed the circumambulation 114 round the fire, O dear.

4. The husband of Parvati exhibited a wonderful feat. celestial sage, listen to that. I shall mention it out of love for you.

5. On that occasion, deluded by Siva’s power of illusion I stared at the feet of the goddess as well as the crescent-shaped nails. O

6. On seeing them, celestial sage, I became overwhelmed by passion. My mind was greatly disturbed.

7. Deluded by the cupid I stared at her limbs frequently. Then, immediately after staring at them, my semen dropped on the ground.

8. I, the grandfather, was ashamed by the emission of my semen. O sage, I pressed the penis secretly with my feet.

9. O Narada, on coming to know of it, the great God Siva became furious. He wanted to kill me immediately because I was overwhelmed by lust.

10. O Narada, there was great hue and cry everywhere. All the people trembled. Even Visnu, the sustainer of the universe, was terrified.

11. O sage, then Visnu and other gods eulogised Siva who was blazing furiously and who attempted to kill me. The gods said:

12. O lord of gods, O pervader of the universe, O Sadariva, O lord of the universe, O lord of the world or the very world itself, be pleased.

13. You are the supreme soul, the supreme lord and the cause of all emotions. You are free from aberrations.

113. The brother of the bride pours out of his joined hands into her joined hands fried rice grains mixed with Sami leaves. The bride sacrifices them with firmly joined hands standing, while the bridegroom recites the verses. For details see P.G.S. 1.6. i-S.

# 14.

You are Truth, Brahman and Consciousness. You are imperishable, from whom have originated the beginning, the end and the middle of visible worlds, even I too. These visible things are not the true ones.

# 15.

The sages, desirous of liberation, worship and meditate upon your lotus feet. They are steady in their resolve. They avoid attachment on either side.

# 16.

You are the perfect Brahman, the nectar, free from grief, devoid of attributes and the great one. You are the sole bliss, free from excitement, aberrations and even static and insentient.

# 17.

You are the cause of production, sustenance and dissolution of the universe. Siva, the lord of souls, is greater than the universe. He is free from the necessity of its aid. He is always pervasive.

# 18.

You are the One, both Sat and Asat. You are non-dual. Gold whether as the basic metal or as the ready made ornament does not alter in its basic and intrinsic essence.

# 19.

People have doubts in you by their ignorance. The remedy for illusion lies in thinking on your Nirguna aspect, not by itself.

O O supreme lord, we are blessed by your very vision. Siva, you are the bestower of supreme bliss to the people who are steady in their devotion. Have mercy.

27. O lord, the fire, the sun and the moon are your eyes. The clouds are your hair. The planets and the stars are your ornaments.

28. O lord of gods, how shall I eulogise you? O supreme lord, you are beyond description. O Siva, you are incomprehensible to the mind.

29. Obeisance to Thee, the five-faced Rudra. Obeisance to thee, with fifty crores of forms. Obeisance to thee, the lord of three deities. Obeisance to the most excellent one. Obeisance to the principle of learning.

Brahma said:

32. On bearing their words, lord Siva was delighted. Favourably disposed to his devotees he offered me freedom from fear. O dear, then Visnu, the other gods and the sages began to smile and became merry.

34. O dear, my semen pressed very frequently, turned into several sparkling drops.

35. Thousands of sages called Valakhilyas sprang up from the sparkling drops.

36. O sage, then the sages, gathered near me with great pleasure and said— “O father O father”.

They were then sternly told by you urged by Siva’s wish. The Valakhilyas were rebuked angrily by you, N&#x26;rada said:—

# 38.

All of you together go to the mountain Gandhamidana. You shall not stay here. No purpose shall be served by your staying here.

# 39.

After performing great penance you will become great sages and disciples of the sun. This has been said by me at the behest of Siva.

# 40.

Thus addressed, all the Valakhilyas went immediately to the mountain Gandhamadana after bowing to Siva.

# 41.

O excellent sage, I was able to breathe fearlessly, thanks to Visnu and others, the noble souls urged by lord Siva.

# 42.

After knowing that Siva favourably disposed to His devotees can do everything and dispel the pride of the wicked, I eulogised Him, the lord of all.

# 43.

O great God, O lord of gods, the ocean of mercy, you are the creator, the sustainer and the annihilator of everything.

# 44.

It is at your will that the entire world including the mobile and immobile is kept checked as the bulls amongst a series of cows.

After saying so I bowed to Him with palms joined in reverence. Vi$nu and others too eulogised lord Siva.

# 46.

On hearing the piteous eulogies made by me as well as by Vi$nu and others lord Siva became delighted.

He granted me the boon of fearlessness delightedly. All were happy, O sage, and I rejoiced much.

# CHAPTER FIFTY

# (Description of fun and frolic)

Brahma said:

1. O N&#x26;rada, thereafter at the bidding of Siva, I carried out the concluding ceremonies of the wedding of Siva and Parvati joyously through the sages.
2. Their ceremonial head-bath117 was respectfully gone through. The brahmins showed the Pole star Dhruva111 with respect.
3. Thereafter the rite of Hfdayalambhana111 was performed. O great brahmin, then Svastipatha* was jubilantly celebrated.
4. At the behest of the brahmins, Siva applied Red powder111 on the head of Parvati. The lustre of Parvati at that time was beyond description and very wondrous.
5. Thereafter at the bidding of the brahmins both sat on the same cushion and attained such a lustre as accentuated joy in the hearts of the devotees.
6. O sage, then they returned to their apartment and, at my behest performed the rite of Samsrava PrSSana*, of wonderful sportive nature that they were.
7. When the sacrificial rites in marriage ceremony were thus concluded duly, lord Siva gave the Purpap&#x26;tra111 to me, the creator of the worlds.

117 - The bride is sprinkled on her head. The ceremony renders the bride free from physical troubles and sanctifies her for the married life.

118. In the night the bridegroom shows to the bride the polar star—a performance suggestive of firmness in the conjugal life.

119. The husband touches the heart of the bride reaching over her right shoulder. The heart is the centre of feelings. By touching it the husband symbolically tries to rouse them and make them flow out to meet his own heart and thus unite them in the world of love.

120. VS 2*j. 19 and Ibid 25.14. These verses are usually recited on auspicious occasions.

121. The printing of red lead on the bead of the bride by the bridegroom is the most striking feature of the present day marriage ceremonies, nowhere mentioned in the Grhyasfltras. The later Paddhatts, however, refer to this custom. Cf. GadAdhara on P.G-S. 1.8.0.

122. At the end of the nuptial ceremony, a vessel full of raw rice grains is given to the officiating priest who conducts the nuptials. A cow, as a ceremonial gift, is also offered along with some hard cash and clothes.

10. The Gods, mobile and immobile creatures, rejoiced much. Shouts of victory rose up.

11. Auspicious sounds of music were heard everywhere. The sound of the musical instruments was pleasing and increased the joy of everyone.

12. Vi?nu accompanied by me, all the gods and sages took leave of the mountain and returned to their abodes.

13. The ladies in the city of the mountain then took Siva and Parvati to the abode of Kubera.

14. There several social customs and conventions were gone through by the ladies. All round, there was great jubilation.

15. Then the couple, benefactors of the people, were led near the bed chamber. It was exquisitely decorated according to convention.

16. The ladies of the city of Himavat approached them and performed the customary auspicious rites.

17. Shouting cries of victory they untied the knot. They were smiling and ogling at one another with hairs standing on their ends due to pleasure.

18-20. Entering the bedchamber and gazing at lord Siva, the beautiful damsels were much fascinated and they praised their good luck. He was gorgeously dressed in fine clothes. He was bedecked in gemset ornaments. He appeared to be in the prime of youth. He fascinated the ladies with charming loveliness. He was smiling gently and glancing at everyone lovingly.

21-23. Then the sixteen celestial ladies arrived there and saw the couple with great respect. They were Sarasvatl, Laksmi, S&#x26;vitrl, Jahnavi, Aditi, SacI, Lopamudra, Arundhatl,

25. A gemset throne was offered to Siva who sat on it joyously. The celestial ladies made these sweet witty remarks to Him one by one.

# Sarasvati said:

26. O great lord, Satl who was more than your life to you has now joyously rejoined you. O lover, seeing the face of your beloved of moonlike splendour, cast off the heat of your distress.

27. Spend your time, O lord of time, in the close embrace of Sati. Thanks to my fervent wish, there will be no separation at any time between you both.

28. O lord of gods, leave off your shyness. Take Sat! to your bosom and stand close to her. Why do you feel shy of her without whom your vital airs may go off.

30. Take hold of the hand of your beloved wife glittering with gold and stroke her hair. There is no higher pleasure at the hands of her lover to a loving maiden than this.

33. O Siva, a duty shall be performed by women in the bedchamber after the meal. Hence give Tambula (betel leaves with spices) to Siva and go to bed.

Arundhati said:

34. This lady was not intended at first to be given to you. But it is after my efforts that she has been given to you. Hence you must have a good dalliance with her.

Ahalyd said:

35. Leave off your old age. Be extremely youthful so that Mena whose mind is fixed in her daughter may approve of you.

Tulasi said:

36. Satl was formerly abandoned by you. Kama too was burnt. Then lord, how is it that Vasi?tha is sent as an emissary now.

37. Now, O great lord, be steady in the words of women. There is a duty for women after marriage, maturity and loftiness of demeanour.

Brahmd said:

42. On hearing these words of the women, lord Siva, who was free from aberrations and was the supreme preceptor of great Yogins spoke to them.

Siva said:

43. O dignified ladies, do not utter such words to me. You are the chaste mothers of the worlds, how do you speak so trivially in regard to your son?

Brahmd said:

44. On hearing the words of Siva, the celestial ladies were ashamed. In their excitement they became motionless like dolls in a picture.

45. Eating the sweets and performing Acamana lord Siva was much delighted. In the company of His wife He chewed the betal with camphor.

1. At that time, thinking that the hour was favourable, Rati hopefully spoke to Siva who is favourably disposed towards depressed people.
2. Rati said: Why did you reduce my beloved husband to ashes without gaining any interest when he had come near you with Parvati? He was my only fortunate possession very rare to get.
3. Give me back my husband, the lord of my journey of life who used to work lovingly with me. Remove my distress caused by separation.
4. O lord Siva, in the great festival of your marriage, all people are happy. I alone am unhappy without my husband.
5. O lord, make me possessed of my husband. O Siva, be pleased. O lord, friend of the distressed, please make your words true.
6. Excepting you, who is there in the three worlds including the mobile and immobile creatures who can destroy my sorrow. Knowing this, be merciful.
7. O lord, merciful to the depressed, make me jubilant at the jubilant celebration of your marriage that gives pleasure to everyone.
8. There is no doubt in this, that only when my lord is resuscitated will your sportive dalliance with your beloved Parvati be complete and perfect.
9. You are competent to do everything because you are the supreme lord. O lord of all, of what avail is this talk. Please resuscitate my husband quickly.

Brahmd said:

After saying thus she gave him the ashes of the cupid along with the bag in which they had been contained.

“O lord, O lord", saying thus she lamented much in front of Siva.

Brahma said:

13. On hearing their words, lord Siva was delighted. The lord, the ocean of mercy, glanced compassionately.

14. Thanks to the nectarine glance of the Trident-bearing lord, Kama came out of the ashes, a comely wonder-inspiring body with splendid dress and features.

25. Addressing Kama, the gods congratulated him and offered him their auspicious blessings. Remembering Siva, Vi$nu and others spoke to him.

The gods said:

26. O Kama, you are blessed. Burnt by Siva you have been blessed by Him. The lord of all has resuscitated you by means of his sympathetic glance, the Sattvika part.

The gods said:

38. There was great jubilation there, O sage. Vedic mantras were recited loudly. The people played on the four kinds of musical instruments.

39. Siva came to His apartment and bowed to the sages, Vi$i?u and me in accordance with the worldly conventions and was saluted by the gods and others.

40. Shouts of Victory and Obeisance rose up along with the auspicious sound of Vedic chants. There was great tumult.

# CHAPTER FIFTYTHREE

# (Description of Siva's return journey)

Brahmd said:

1. Then Visnu and other gods, the sages and ascetics sent message to the mountain about their intention to leave after finishing their immediate duties.
2. Then the lord of mountains finished his ceremonial ablution and the worship of his favourite deity. Calling his kinsmen in the city, he came to the audience hall joyously.
3. There he worshipped the lord with pleasure and requested him to stay in his house for a few days more along with all the people.
4. "O Siva” he said “I am contented by your sight. I am blessed since you came here with the gods”.
5. Saying these words and many more, the lord of mountains pleaded with palms joined in reverence to the lord along with Visnu and other gods.
6. Then the gods and sages remembered Siva and spoke with delight.

The gods said:

O lord of the mountains, you are blessed. Your glory is great. Even in the three worlds, there is none equal to you in merit.
At your very door, lord Siva, the supreme Brahman, the goal of the good and favourably disposed to His devotees, has deigned to come along with us, His slaves.
O lord of mountains, this audience hall is very excellent. You have honoured us in diverse ways. The foodstuffs served to us were extraordinary. It is impossible to describe them suitably.
It is no wonder that everything is perfect where the goddess Parvati is present. We too are blessed since we came.

Brahmd said:—

Thus there was mutual admiration and glorification of an enlightened nature—There was great jubilation.

# 12.

There were auspicious songs. The celestial damsels danced. The bards sang songs of praise. There was a liberal exchange of monetary gifts.

# 13.

Then the mountain took leave of the lord of gods and went home. He made arrangements for a joyous feast with all paraphernalia in accordance with the rules.

# 14.

He brought the lord with all his attendants and followers for the feast. He was very enthusiastic.

# 15-16.

He washed the feet of Siva, Visnu and mine with reverence. He seated all of us, including the gods, the sages and others in the altar. The lord of mountains was assisted by his kinsmen.

# 17.

The mountain satiated them with various kinds of juicy foodstuffs. All of them took food including Siva, Vijnu and me.

# 18.

Then the ladies of the city indulged in the customary utterance of foul abusive words laughing, jingling and peeping at all of them.

# 19.

O Narada, they took their food and rinsed their mouths. Taking leave of the mountain they returned to their apartments fully satisfied and pleased.

# 20.

O sage, on the third day similarly they were thus duly honoured by the lord of mountains with customary gifts.

# 21.

On the fourth day, the rite of Caturthikarman was performed with due observance. Without this the marriage rites would have been incomplete.

# 22.

There was diverse jubilant festivity. Shouts of “well-done”, “Victory” etc were heard. There were exchanges of gifts, sweet music and different kinds of dances.

# 23.

On the fifth day the delighted gods lovingly intimated to the mountain about their desire to go back.

# 24.

On hearing that, the lord of mountains spoke to the gods with palms joined in reverence “O gods, please stay a few days more”.

124. This rite is to be named because it is performed on the fourth day after the wedding. It is performed at the house of the bride's father before the marriage party leaves it. The purpose of this rite is to remove evil influence from the person of the bride which may cause harm to the family. For details see P.G.S. 1.11.13.

25. Saying thus with great love he made all of us, the lord, Viṣṇu and others stay there for many days, honouring us duly every day.

26. Thus many days elapsed as the gods continued to stay there. Then the gods sent the seven sages to the lord of the mountains.

27. They enlightened the mountain and Mena with what was relevant to the occasion. They told them about Siva’s principles with due praise.

28. O sage, the proposal was agreed to by the great lord. Then Siva went to the mountain to tell him about the intended journey, along with the gods and others.

29. When the lord of gods started on his journey towards his mountain along with the gods, Menā cried aloud and told the merciful lord.

Mend said:

30. O merciful lord, do mercifully protect Parvatī. You are quickly pleased. Hence you will please forgive even a thousand faults in her.

31. My dear daughter is devoted to your lotus-like feet in every birth. Even sleeping or awake she does not think about anything else.

32. O conqueror of death, even on hearing about your devotion she is filled with tears of pleasure and horripilation. On hearing your censure she becomes silent as though dead.

Brahma said:

33. Saying this, Menakā dedicated her daughter to Him and crying aloud became unconscious in front of them.

34. When she regained consciousness, Siva took leave of her and the mountain and set on journey with the gods jubilantly.

35. The gods with the lord and His Ganas started on their journey silently. They wished the mountain well.

36-37. The lord and the gods waited in a part outside the city of Himavat for the arrival of Parvatī there. O great sage, thus I have narrated the journey of Siva. Now listen to the journey of Parvatī and of her departure with festivities.

# CHAPTER FIFTYFOUR

# (Description of the duties of the chaste wife)

Brahmd said:

1. Then the seven sages spoke to the lord of the mountains, “O mountain, make arrangements for the journey of your daughter today itself.”
2. O great sage, on hearing these words and knowing her pangs of separation, the lord of mountains was greatly affected by his love towards her and remained silent for a short while.
3. After some time, the lord of the mountains regained his consciousness and said— “Let it be so”. He then sent the message to Mena.
4. O sage, on hearing the message of the mountain, Mena was both delighted and sorry. She immediately set about arranging for her journey.
5. O sage, Mena, the beloved of the mountain, made arrangements for all kinds of festivities in accordance with the tradition of her family and the injunctions of the Vedas.
6. She bedecked Parvatl with twelve kinds of ornaments and good silken garments of nice border. All kinds of embellishments befitting her royal state were made.
7. Realising Mena’s inclinations, a chaste brahmin lady instructed Parvatl in the duties of a chaste wife. The brahmin lady said:
8. O Parvatl, listen to my words with love that accentuate righteousness, that increase the pleasure here and hereafter and afford happiness to those who pay heed to them.
9. A chaste lady sanctifies the worlds, destroys sins and is blessed. None else is so worthy of respect.
10. O Parvatl, she who serves her husband with love and considers him her sole lord, enjoys all pleasures here and obtains salvation hereafter along with her husband.
11. The — Lopamudra, chaste ladies Sivitri,

Arundhati, Sandilya, Satarupa, Anasuya, Lak$mi, Svadha, Sati, Samjrta, Sumati, Sraddha, Mena, Svaha and several others whose names are not mentioned lest the list should be too detailed have attained adoration from all people by their virtue of chastity. They have been honoured by Brahma, Visnu, Siva and great sages.

# 14.

Lord Siva, benefactor of the depressed, worthy of worship and the goal of the good shall be served by you always.

# 15.

The duty of a chaste lady is very important and it has been mentioned in the Vedas and Smrtis. No other duty is so admirable as this.

# 16.

A chaste lady shall take food only after her husband has taken it. O Siva, if he stands, the woman too shall remain standing.

# 17.

When he sleeps she can also sleep. But she must intelligently wake up before him. She shall do what is beneficial to him. She shall love him without any sort of deception.

# 18.

O Siva, she shall never show herself unembellished to him. If for any important work he is on exile she shall never adorn herself.

# 19.

A chaste lady shall never mention her husband’s name. If the husband scolds or rebukes her she shall not abuse him in return. Even when beaten by him she shall remain glad and say “I may even be killed, O lord. Be kind to me.”

# 20.

When called by him she shall leave the work she is engaged in and approach him immediately. With palms joined in reverence and love she shall bow to him and say as follows.

# 21.

“O lord, be pleased to say what I have been called for.” Whenever ordered by him to do any job she shall do it gladly.

# 22.

She shall not stand near the entrance for a long time. She shall not go to other people's house. She shall not take his money, even though it be a little, and give it to others.

# 23.

Without being told she shall arrange the necessary

# 702 Swapurtya

Requisities for his daily worship. She shall wait for the opportunity to do him a timely service.

1. Without the permission of her husband she shall not go even on pilgrimage. She shall eschew the desire to attend social festivities.
2. If a woman wants holy water she shall drink the same with which her husband’s feet have been washed. All holy rivers are present in that water.
3. She shall partake of the leavings of her husband’s food or whatever is given by him saying “This is thy great grace.”
4. She shall never take food without first offering due share to the gods, the Pitp, the guests, the servants, cows and saindy mendicants.
5. A gentle lady of chaste rites shall always be clever to manage the household with limited requisites. She shall be averse to spend unnecessarily.
6. Without being permitted by her husband she shall not observe fast and other rites. Should it be so, she will derive no benefit. She may fall into hell in other worlds.
7. While the husband is sportively engaged or seated comfortably she shall not worry him to get up under the pretext of attending to some household work.
8. Whether he is impotent, distressed, sick or senile, happy or unhappy, the husband shall never be transgressed.
9. During the three days of her monthly course she shall neither show her face nor speak to him. She shall not speak within his hearing till she becomes pure after her bath.
10. After her bath she shall see her husband’s face and not that of anyone else. Or after thinking on her husband she shall then gaze at the sun.
11. If a chaste lady wishes for the longevity of her husband she shall not forsake turmeric, vermilion, saffron, collyrium, a blouse, the betel, the necklace, ornaments, brushing and plaiting the hair, bangles and earrings.
12. A chaste woman shall never associate intimately with a washerwoman, a harlot, a female ascetic or a fallen woman.
13. She shall not talk to any woman who disparages.

or hates her husband. She shall not stand alone anywhere nor shall she take bath in the nude.

# 38.

A chaste lady shall never sleep on a mortar, threshing rod, a broom, a grinding stone, a machine or on the threshold.

# 39.

Except at the time of sexual intercourse she shall never show her maturity and initiative. She shall like whatever her husband is interested in.

# 40.

A chaste lady shall be delighted when her husband is delighted and dejected when he is dejected. She shall always wish for his benefit.

# 41.

She shall be virtuous and equanimous in affluence and adversity. She shall have fortitude and shall never go astray.

# 42.

Even when ghee, salt, oil or other things are exhausted she shall not tell her husband openly about it lest he should be subjected to undue strain.

# 43.

O Goddess, the husband is superior to Brahml, Vijnu or Siva, for a chaste lady her husband is on a par with Siva.

# 44.

She who transgresses her husband and observes fast and other rites wrecks the longevity of her husband and after death goes to hell.

# 45.

If she furiously retorts to her husband she is born as a bitch in a village or as a vixen in a secluded place.

# 46.

The chaste lady shall never take a higher seat, never approach a defiled person, never speak to her husband in agitation.

# 47.

She should avoid slanderous words, shun quarrels and shall not speak aloud or laugh in the presence of elders.

# 48-49.

She who delights her husband delights all the worlds. When she sees her husband coming home she shall hasten to serve him food and water, hand him betel and change of garments, and serve him by massaging his feet. By pleasing words she shall fascinate him and dispel his gloom.

# 50.

What father gives is limited, what brother gives is limited and what the son gives is also limited. A chaste lady shall worship her husband who gives what has no limit.

# 51.

To a wife the husband is god, preceptor, virtue,

# Sivapurdna

holy centre and sacred rite. She should cast off everything and adore him alone.

# 52.

She who forsakes her husband and secretly violates her fidelity is born as a she-owl of cruel nature wasting its days in the hollow of a tree.

# 53.

If she desires to beat her husband in retaliation, she becomes a tiger or a wild cat. She who ogles at another man becomes squint-eyed.

# 54.

She who partakes of sweet dish denying the same to her husband becomes a pig in the village or a wild goat eating its own dung.

# 55.

She who addresses her husband in singular becomes dumb. She who is jealous of a co-wife becomes ill-fated in matrimony again and again.

# 56.

She who casts glance on another person hiding it from her husband becomes one-eyed, twisted-faced or ugly.

# 57.

Just as a body bereft of the soul becomes unclean in a moment, similarly a woman without a husband is always unclean even though she may take a neat bath.

# 58.

The mother, the father and the husband are blessed if there is a chaste lady in the house.

# 59.

The three families—that of the father, that of the mother and that of the husband—enjoy the pleasures of heaven due to the merit of the chaste woman.

# 60.

Disloyal women cause the downfall of the three families, that of the father, mother and husband and become distressed here and hereafter.

# 61.

Wherever the chaste lady sets her foot, the sin is dispelled therefrom and the place is sanctified.

# 62.

Even the sun, moon and wind touch the chaste woman to sanctify themselves and not otherwise.

# 63.

Waters desire the touch of the chaste lady thinking— “Now our sluggishness is gone. Now we are able to purify others”.

# 64.

Wife is the root of the household, and of its happiness; she is the source of the fruit of virtue and for the flourishing of the family.

# 65.

In every house there are women proud of their exquisite beauty and comely appearance. But it is only due to the devotion of Siva that a chaste lady is obtained.



---

Rudrasartihitd
# 66.

The present and the next world can be won through her. A wifeless man is not authorized to perform the rites of gods, Pitrs, guests, and sacrifices.

# 67.

He alone is the true householder in whose house there is a chaste lady. The others are devoured by an ogress or old age.

# 68.

Just as the body is purified by a plunge in the Ganga, so everything is sanctified on seeing a chaste woman.

# 69.

A chaste lady is not different from Ganga. She and her husband are like Parvati and Siva. Hence a sensible man shall worship them.

# 70.

The husband is the high tone and the wife is the quarter tone. The husband is austerity and the woman is forbearance. O The husband is the fruit and the wife is a sacred rite. O Parvati, such a pair is blessed.

# 71.

Daughter of the lord of mountains, thus the duty of a chaste wife is described to you. Now, listen to their classifications with attention and love.

# 72.

O gentle lady, the chaste ladies can be divided into four classes. Even when they are remembered they dispel sins. The divisions comprise of the superior etc.

# 73.

They are superior, middling, inferior, and very inferior. I shall explain their characteristics. Listen with attention. O gentle lady, she whose mind is not aware of anyone else and who is conscious of her husband even in her dreams is the noblest of all.

# 74.

O daughter of the mountain, she who sees another man as her father, brother, or son with a clean conscience is the middling among chaste ladies.

# 75.

O Parvati, she who ponders over her duty mentally and desists from going astray is inferior among the chaste. Of course, she is pure in conduct.

# 76.

She who remains chaste for fear of her husband or the family is very inferior among the chaste ladies, so say the ancient poets.

# 77.

O Parvati, these four types of chaste ladies dispel sins. They sanctify all the worlds. They are delighted here and hereafter.

# 78.

A brahmin who died due to the curse of Var£ha

706 Sivapurfyia (Boar), was at the request of the three deities, resuscitated by Atri’a wife (Anasuya), thanks to the power of chastity.

80. O Siva, O daughter of the mountain, knowing this well, you shall render service to your husband every day with pleasure as it bestows all desires.

81. You are the Goddess and the mother of the universe. Siva Himself is your husband. By remembering you women become chaste.

82. O Parvati, O gentle lady, what avails mentioning all this to you. Still I mention this just to follow the worldly convention.

Brahmd said:

83. Saying this, the brahmin lady stopped and bowed to her. Parvati, the beloved of Siva, derived great pleasure.

# CHAPTER FIFTYFIVE

# (Siva returns to Kaildsa)

Brahmd said:

1. Thus instructing the goddess in the rites of a chaste lady, the brahmin lady told Mena while taking leave of her “Make arrangements for her journey”.

2. Saying “So be it” she became exasperated by her affection. Controlling herself a little she called Parvati to her when her agitation due to imminent separation became all the more unbearable.

3. Embracing her she cried loudly and frequently. Parvati too cried uttering piteous words.

4. The beloved of the mountain as well as her daughter became unconscious due to grief. The wives of the gods too fainted on hearing Pirvad cry.

5. All the ladies cried. Everything became senseless. Who else, even the great lord, the leader of Yogins, cried at the time of departure.

6. In the meantime, Himavat came hurriedly along with his sons, ministers and brahmins.

# 7.

Holding his dear daughter to his bosom and saying “Where are you going?” with frequent vague vacant glances, he cried due to his fascination.

# 8.

Then the chief priest in the company of other brahmins enlightened everyone. The wise priest by his spiritual discourse was able to convince them easily.

# 9.

With great devotion Parvati bowed to her parents and the preceptor. Following the worldly convention she cried aloud frequently.

# 10.

When Parvati cried the ladies cried too, particularly the mother Mena, sisters and brothers.

# 11.

Her mother, sister, brothers, father and the other ladies who were affectionately attached to her cried frequently.

# 12.

Then the brahmins respectfully intimated to them the auspicious hour for the starting of the journey and consoled them.

# 13.

Then Himavat and Mena composed themselves and caused the palanquin to be brought for Parvati to get in.

# 14.

The brahmin ladies helped her to get into the palanquin. They gave their blessings. Her parents and the brahmins too offered their blessings.

# 15.

Mena and the lord of mountains gave her a royal send-off with various auspicious rare presents not accessible to common people.

# 16.

O sage, Parvati started after bowing to the preceptors, elders, father, mother, the brahmins, the chief priest, sisters and the other women.

# 17.

Himavat, the sensible affectionate father with his sons accompanied her as far as the place where the lord was waiting joyously along with the gods.

# 18.

Everyone was jubilant and jolly with love. They bowed to the lord with devotion. Praising Him they returned to Kailasa.

# 19.

Then Siva told Parvati “I reminding although you know the previous birth. If you remember, speak out. In my divine sport you are always my beloved.”

# 20.

On hearing the words of Siva, Satī Parvati the beloved of Siva replied smiling.

Pdrvati said:

22. On hearing her words as pleasing as the steady flow of nectar, Siva rejoiced much, eagerly devoted to the way of the world.

23. Getting every requisite thing ready, he fed the gods including Vi?nu and others with various pleasant things.

24. He fed all the others who had attended His marriage with juicy cooked food of various sorts.

25. After taking food the gods and the Ganas, with their womenfolk fully bedecked in gems and jewels bowed to the moon-crested lord.

26. After eulogising Him with pleasing words and circumambulating Him with joy they praised the marriage celebration and returned to their abodes.

27. O sage, Siva Himself bowed to me and to Vi?nu following the worldly convention as Visnu had bowed to Ka<yapa class="<" p="">
</yapa>
28. Considering Him the supreme Brahman I eulogised him in the excellent manner after embracing him and offering him my benediction.

29. Visnu and I with palms joined in reverence, took leave of them and praising the marriage of Siva and Parvati went back to Visnu’s abode.

30. On the mountain, Siva stayed with Parvati and continued his divine sports with joy. The Ganas too were happy and they worshipped the married couple.

31. O dear, I have thus narrated the auspicious story of the marriage of Siva, that dispels sorrow, generates delight and increases wealth and longevity.

32. He who hears this story with pure mind fixed on them or narrates the same, shall attain Sivaloka.

33. This narrative is said to be wondrous and the cause of everything auspicious. It quells all hindrances and ailments.

35. It wards off premature death. It is auspicious and it causes peace. It makes bad dreams subside. It is an instrument for the acquisition of keen intellect.

36. It shall be read on all occasions of Siva’s festivals by the people who desire auspicious results. It gives satisfaction to Siva.

37. At the installation of the idols of the deities this shall be particularly read. At the beginning of all auspicious rites it shall be read with pleasure.

I salute Siva who is eulogised by Vi?gu and BrahmS, who urged by His sympathy assumes visible forms, who bestows truth, who loves truth, whose assets are the threefold truths and who is identical with truth.

2. O Brahma, after marrying Parvat! and returning to His mountain what did Siva the benefactor of the worlds do? Please narrate it to me.

5. On hearing these words of Narada, Prajapati was highly delighted and he replied after thinking on Siva.

123. T&#x26;raka, the ion of VajtA6ga, was a Daitya whose austerities made him formidable to the gods. The present section narrates the birth of Kumlra, known as Skanda, Cuba, k&#x26;rttikeya etc. who slew the demon Ttraka.

Brahma said:—

1. O Narada, listen to the tale of Siva, the moon-crested lord. I shall narrate the story of Guha's birth and the slaying of the demon Taraka.
2. Let it be heard. I shall tell you the story that destroys all sins, on hearing which a man is freed from all sins.
3. This narrative is sinless. It is a wonderful secret. It dispels the distress caused by sin and wards off all obstacles.
4. It bestows everything auspicious. It is the essence of the Vedas and is pleasing to the ears. It is conducive to happiness. It is the cause of liberation and cuts off the roots of all actions.
5. Returning to Kailasa after marrying Parvati, Siva attained added lustre. He thought over the task of the gods and the pain of the people involved in the fulfilment of that task.
6. When Siva returned to Kailasa, the joyful Ganas made all arrangements for His happiness.
7. When Siva returned to Kailasa, there was great jubilation there. The gods returned to their realms with their minds full of joy.
8. Then taking Parvati, the daughter of the mountain, with Him, Siva, the great Lord, went to a delightful brilliant isolated place.
9. Making a wonderful bed conducive to good sexual pleasure, rendered smooth and fragrant with flowers and sandal paste and auspiciously supplemented with objects of enjoyment, lord Siva the bestower of honour, indulged in dalliance with Parvati for a thousand years of god.
10. In that divine sport at the mere contact with...

Guha, better known as Krittikeya was the son of Siva. Born in a thicket in a forest, out of the semen of Siva, without the intervention of Parvati he was fostered by the Pleiades (Krittikas) whence he received the title Krittikeya. When grown into youth, he became the Commander-in-Chief (senāpati) of the army of Siva, fought and slew the Daitya Taraka. As he killed (māra) the evil (ku) Asura, he became known as Kumara.

For different calculations of the time-durations see Sk. P. Ch. 14A-145.

Parvati, Siva lapsed in unconsciousness. She too lapsed into unconsciousness due to the contact with Siva. She neither knew the day nor the night.

17. When Siva, following the worldly way, began his enjoyment of pleasures, O sinless one, a great length of time passed by as though it was a mere moment in their awareness.

18. Then, O dear, Indra and the gods gathered together on the mountain Meru and began their mutual discussion.

The gods said:

19. It is for the fulfilment of our task that Lord Siva, the leader of Yogins, free from aberrations, the unsullied, has married. How is it that the lord of gods is delaying the action? We do not know the reason.

Brahma said:

20. In the meantime, from Narada who has the divine vision, the gods came to know of the extent of the enjoyment of the couple engaged in dalliance.

21. Realising that their enjoyment had extended over a long time, the gods became worried. Making me Brahma as their leader, they approached Visnu Narayana.

22. After bowing to him, I narrated to him all the details we desired to convey. The gods stood steady and silent like dolls painted in a picture.

23. For a thousand years according to the calculation of the gods, Siva the Yogin has been engaged in sexual dalliance. He does not desist from it.

Lord Visnu said:

24. O creator of the universe, there is nothing to worry about. Everything will be well. O lord of gods, seek refuge in the great lord Siva.

25. O lord of subjects, the people who dedicate their...

minds to and seek refuge in Him joyously and devoutly have nothing to fear from any quarter.

# 27.

The interruption to amorous dalliance will take place at the proper time, not now, O Brahma. Any task carried out at the proper time shall be crowned with success, not otherwise.

# 28.

If the enjoyment is desired by Siva who can check it? When another thousand years are completed He will desist from it, out of his own will.

# 29.

If any one separates the copulated pair by a tricky expedient, he will have the pangs of separation from his wife and sons in every birth.

# 30.

He will fall from perfect wisdom. His glory will be destroyed. He will lose his fortune. That sinner after his death will suffer the tortures of the hell Kalasutra1 for a hundred thousand years.

# 31.

The sage Durvasas10 separated Indra in copulation with Rambha191 and the sage got separation from his wife as a result thereof.

# 32.

He took another woman as his wife and thus put an end to the pangs of separation lasting for a thousand years of the gods.

# 33.

Brahmaspati hindered Kama in copulation with Ghrtaci13 but within six months the moon abducted his wife.

# 34.

He then propitiated Siva, fought a battle over Tara, enjoyed her even as she was pregnant and tried to dispel his pangs of separation.

# 35.

The sage Gautama forced the moon in the company of Rohini to desist from sexual dalliance and he suffered the pangs of separation from his wife.

to the effect thereof. He lost his wife, son and kingdom. He was tarmented by Visvamitra. It was only after propitiating Siva that he could get released from that sin.

38. Though Ajamila, 1 a noble brahmin, was in copulation with a Sudra woman, gods did not interfere due to this fear.

39. Everything can be achieved through the discharge of the semen. O Brahma, the process of discharge is very effective. The discharge that is fruitful none can withhold.

40-41. O gods, Siva’s act of enjoyment will extend to a thousand years of celestial calculation. After that period is over, you can go there and do such things as will necessitate the fall of the semen on the ground. The son of the lord named Skanda will be born of that.

42. O Brahma, return to your abode along with the gods. Let Siva carry on enjoyment in the isolated place in the company of Parvati.

43. After saying this, the lord of Laksmi immediately returned to his harem. O great sage, the gods too returned to their abodes along with me.

44. On account of the dalliance of Siva and Parvati, the earth quaked with the weight along with Se$a (the serpent) and Kacchapa1 (the tortoise).

45. By the weight of Kacchapa, the cosmic air, the support of everything, was stunned and the three worlds became terrified and agitated.

46. Then the gods along with me sought refuge in Vi$oii and in our depression intimated to him the news.

The gods said:

47. O Vi?nu, the lord of the gods, O lord and protector of all, save us who have sought refuge in you and whose minds are acutely terrified.

48. The vital air of the three worlds is stunned. We do not know wherefore. The three worlds including the

mobile and immobile as well as the gods and the sages are excited.

Brahma said:

1. After saying this, O great sage, all the depressed gods, stood silent along with me in front of Visnu with great misery.
2. On hearing those words, Visnu took us all immediately to the mountain Kailasa, the favourite haunt of Siva.
3. After going there in the company of the gods and me, the favourite deity of the gods went to the excellent resort of Siva with a desire to see Siva.
4. Unable to see Him there, Visnu and the gods became surprised. With humility he asked the Ganas of Siva who were there.

Visnu said:

O Ganas of Siva, where has Siva, the lord of all gone? Sympathetically intimate this to us who are depressed.

Brahma said:

On hearing these words of Visnu in the company of the gods, the Ganas of Siva lovingly replied to Visnu.

The Ganas of Siva said:

O Visnu, please listen along with Brahma and the gods, we shall tell you the truth and the details out of love for Siva.
Siva, the lord of all, had gone into the apartment of Parvati after stationing us here with love. He is an expert in indulging in divine sports.
O lord of Lakshmi, many years have gone by. We do not know what Siva, the great lord, is doing within her apartment.

Brahma said:

On hearing their words, O excellent sage, Visnu, the gods and I were perplexed and went to the doorway of Siva’s apartment.

59. After going there along with me and the gods, Visnu, the favourite deity of the gods, spoke in dejection but with joy in the heart.

60. O excellent sage, standing there, along with me and the gods, he eulogised Siva, the lord of all the worlds with great pleasure.

Vijnu said:

61. O great lord, what are you doing there inside? Save us who are harassed by Taraka and who have sought refuge in you.

62. O great sage, praising and pleading like this to Siva, Visnu wept bitterly along with the gods harassed by Taraka. O great tumultuous sage, the cry of the dwellers distressed by the demon got mingled with the sound of eulogy to Siva.

# CHAPTER TWO

# (The birth of Siva's son)

Brahma said: —

1. On hearing that, the great lord, an expert in Yogic theory, though free from lust, did not emit the semen, fearing to offend Parvati.

2. He came to the door, near the gods distressed by the demon. Siva is the benefactor favourably disposed to His devotees.

3. On seeing lord Siva, favourably disposed to His devotees, the gods including me and Visnu became extremely happy. O bowing down with stooping shoulders

# Rudrasarhhitd

O Siva, you arc the immanent soul of all. You know everything.6 O lord, carry out the task of the gods. O great lord, save the gods. Slay Taraka and other demons and take pity on us.

On hearing these words of the gods, lord Siva agitated in soul and dispirited in the mind, replied.

# Siva said:

“O Vi$nu, O Brahma, O gods, you are the goal of everybody’s mind. What should happen necessarily must happen. There is none to stop it.

What has happened has already happened. Now gods, listen to what is relevant to the context. Let him who will, take up this discharged semen.” After saying this He let it fall on the ground. Urged by the gods Agni became a dove and swallowed it with his beak. O sage, in the meantime Parvatl came there.

When Siva took a long time to return, she hastened there and saw the gods. On coming to know of the incident she became very furious.

# The goddess said:

Hi Hi, O gods, you are wicked and particularly selfish and for that purpose you give pain to others.

O gods, for the sake of realising your self-interests you all propitiated the lord and spoilt my dalliance. I have become a barren woman therefore.

O gods, after offending me none can be happy. Hence O wicked heaven-dwellers, you will remain unhappy.

# Brahma said:

After saying these words Parvatl, the daughter of the king of mountains, blazing with fury cursed Visnu and all other gods.

# Parvati said:

From now onwards let the wives of the gods be utterly barren and let the gods who offended me be unhappy.

# Sivapur&#x26;na

# 19.

Brahma said: Cursing Visnu and other gods, Parvati furiously told Agni who had swallowed Siva’s semen.

# 20.

Parvati said: O Agni, be the devourer of everything and let your soul be afflicted. You are a fool. You do not know Siva’s fundamental principles. You have come forward to carry out the task of the gods.

# 21.

It is neither proper nor beneficent to you to have eaten up Siva’s semen. You are a rogue, a wretched vile, paying heed to the wicked counsel of the wicked.

# 22.

Brahma said: After cursing the fire thus, O sage, Parvati, the daughter of the mountain, immediately returned to her apartment along with Siva, dissatisfied that she was.

# 23.

O great sage, after returning she persistently pleaded with Siva and bore a son named Gane£a.

# 24.

O sage, the details of that story I shall narrate to you later on. Now listen to the story of the birth of Guha which I am going to narrate.

# 25.

The gods are wont to partake of the offerings of food etc. consigned to the fire in accordance with the Vedic text. Hence the gods became pregnant.

# 26.

Unable to endure the force of the semen they became afflicted. Vi$nu and other gods had already lost their sense at the curse of Parvati.

# 27.

Then Vi$nu and other gods were overwhelmed and scorched. In this state they sought refuge in Siva.

# 28.

After reaching the threshold of Siva’s apartment, the gods humbly eulogised Parvati and Siva with pleasure and with palms joined in reverence.

# 29.

The gods said: O lord of gods, O great lord, consort of Parvati, what has happened now? Your magical power is incapable of being transgressed.

your semen. O Siva, take pity on us. Remove our miserable plight.

Brahma said:

1. O sage, on hearing the eulogy of the gods, Siva, the lord of Parvati came immediately to the threshold where the gods stood waiting.
2. The gods including Visnu bowed humbly with great devotion and eulogised Siva who is favourably disposed to His devotees, who came near the entrance.
3. The gods said:

Brahma said:

On hearing these piteous words, the lord of the gods laughingly replied to the gods with his usual sympathy towards his devotees.
Siva said:
1. O Vi$nu, O Brahma, O gods, all of you listen to my words with attention. You will be happy. Be careful.
2. At my behest you shall vomit this semen virile of mine. You will be happy thereby.

Brahma said:
1. Accepting this command with bent head Vi$nu and the other gods immediately vomitted it out after duly remembering Siva the imperishable.
2. The semen of Siva lustrous and golden in colour falling on the ground seemed to touch the heaven as it was as huge as a mountain.
3. Vi?nu and other gods became relieved and they eulogised the great lord Siva who is favourably disposed to His devotees.

# Sivapurana

41. O great sage, only Agni did not become happy. Siva, the great lord, gave a separate hint to him.

42. Then the distressed fire, O sage, eulogised Siva with palms joined in reverence and piteously spoke these words. Agni said:

43-44. O lord of gods, I am a stupid and deluded servant of yours. Forgive me my fault. Please remove my burning sensation. O lord, you are the benefactor and sympathetic to the distressed.

Brahma said:

45. On hearing the words of Agni, Siva the great lord spoke delightedly to Agni. He is favourably disposed to His devotees.

Siva said:

46. An improper action has been committed by you in swallowing my semen. Hence your sin has become formidable at my bidding and the burning sensation has not been cured.

47. Now that you have sought refuge in me you are sure to be happy. I am pleased with you. All your misery will be dissolved.

48. Deposit carefully that semen in the womb of some good woman. You will become happy and particularly relieved of the burning sensation.

Brahma said:

49. On hearing these words of Siva, Agni replied to Siva, the benefactor of the devotees with pleasure and bowing down with palms joined in reverence.

50. “O lord Siva, this splendour of yours is inaccessible and unbearable. There is no woman in the three worlds except Parvati to hold it in her womb.”

51. O excellent sage, when fire said like this, you, urged by Siva, said thus in order to help Agni.

Ndrada said:

burning sensation. It will yield great pleasure and ward off your pains.

53. O Agni, taking recourse to the following expedient you will be relieved of the burning sensation and be happy. O dear, this has been explained by me well at the will of Siva.

54. O Agni, you shall deposit this semen of Siva in the bodies of the ladies who take their morning baths in the month of Magha.

Brahma said:

55. O sage, meanwhile the wives of the seven celestial sages came there desirous of taking their early morning bath in the month of Magha with other observances of rites.

56. After the bath, six of them were distressed by the dullness and were desirous of going near the flame of fire.

57. Arundhati of good conduct and perfect knowledge saw them deluded and dissuaded them at the behest of Siva.

58. O sage, the six ladies stubbornly insisted on going there to ward off their chillness because they were deluded by Siva’s magical art.

59. Immediately the particles of the semen entered their bodies through the pores of hairs, O sage. The fire was relieved of their burning sensation.

60. Vanishing immediately from the scene, Agni in the form of a flame, went back happily to his region, mentally remembering you and Siva.

61. O saintly one, the women became pregnant and were distressed by the burning sensation. They went home. O dear, Arundhati was displeased with fire.

62. O dear, the husbands on seeing the plight of their wives became furious. They consulted one another and discarded them.

63. O dear, on seeing their own state the six ladies felt very miserable and distressed.

64. The wives of the sages cast off their semen in the form of a foetus at the top of Himavat. They felt then relieved of their burning sensation.

65. Unable to bear that semen of Siva and trembling much, Himavat became scorched by it and hurled it in the Ganga.

66. O great sage, the intolerable semen of lord Siva was deposited by Gariga in the forest of Sara grass by means of its waves.

67. The semen that fell was turned in a handsome good-featured boy, full of glory and splendour. He increased everyone’s pleasure.

68. O great sage, on the sixth day of the bright half of the lunar month of Marga£ir§a, the son of Siva was born in the world. O

69. At that time, Brahmin, on their mountain, Parvati the daughter of Himavat and Siva became very happy.

70. Out of joy, milk exuded from the breasts of Parvati. On reaching the spot everyone felt very happy.

71. O dear, there was auspiciousness in the three worlds, pleasing to the good. There occurred obstacles to the wicked and particularly to the demons.

72. O Narada, there was a mysterious sound of Dundubhi drum in the sky. Showers of flowers fell on the boy.

73. O excellent sage, there was great delight to Visnu and the gods. There was great jubilation everywhere.

# CHAPTER THREE

Narada said:

1. O lord of subjects, O Brahmin, O creator, what happened thereafter? Please tell me the same.

Brahmd said:

2. O dear, then the powerful sage Viivamitra, urged by Brahma, came there casually and was delighted.

3. On seeing the unearthly splendour of that brilliant boy, he became very delighted. He bowed to the boy.

4. With a delighted mind he eulogised him with the words prompted by Brahma. Viivamitra realised his power.

5. The boy too was delighted and became the source of

great enjoyment. Laughingly he spoke to Visvamitra. It was very surprising.

Siva's son said:

1. “O great one of perfect wisdom, it is due to the will of Siva that you have come here by chance. O dear, perform my purificatory rites in accordance with Vedic injunctions.
2. From now onwards you remain my priest conferring your love on me. It is certain that you will become the object of worship of all.”

Brahma said:

On hearing his words, Gadhi’s son (Visvamitra) was highly delighted and surprised. He spoke to him in a tone, by no means highly accented.

Visvamitra said:

Listen, O dear, I am not a brahmin. I am a Ksatriya, son of Gadhi, famous as Visvamitra and a servant of brahmins.
O excellent boy, I have thus narrated my life to you. Who are you? Now mention everything about your life to me who am surprised.

Brahma said:

On hearing his words the boy told him about his life. The divine boy, the cause of great enjoyment and protection, said to Gadhi’s son with great pleasure.

Siva's son said:

O Visvamitra, thanks to my favour, you now become a brahminical sage. Vasistha and others will forever regard you with respect.
Hence, at my behest you shall perform purificatory rites. Keep this as a great secret. You shall not mention it anywhere.

Visvamitra, the son of Gadhi or Gathin, was a born Kshatriya who by intense austerities attained Brahmanhood. Some attribute this change to the favour of Kumara who raised him to Brahmanhood in order to enable him to perform his purificatory rites.



---


Brahma said:

1. O celestial sage, in the manner laid down in the Vedas he performed the purificatory rites for the son of Siva.
2. Siva’s son, the cause of great enjoyment and protection, was glad and conferred divine wisdom on the sage.
3. The son of Agni made Visvamitra his priest. From that time onwards he became a great brahmin and an expert in divine sports of various sorts.
4. O sage, the very first sport that he performed thus has been narrated to you by me. O dear, listen to another sport of his with wonder. I shall narrate it to you.
5. At that time he was known as white in colour. Agni went there and seeing his son who was divine and very holy called him “O dear son.” Agni embraced and kissed him too. He gave him a miraculous weapon, spear.
6. Guha took the spear and ascended the peak. He hit the peak with his spear and the peak fell down.
7. Ten thousand billions of heroic demons came there to attack him but were killed on being hit with the spear.
8. There was great hue and cry. The Earth, the mountains and the three worlds quaked. Indra the lord of gods came there.
9. With his thunderbolt hit on his right side. A person named “Sakha” of great strength came out of that side.
10. Sakra struck him again with his thunderbolt on his left side. Another strong person named Visakha came out of that side.
11. Then Indra struck his heart with his thunderbolt. Another person very powerful like him named Naigama came out.

Sakha, Visakha and Naigama are the three brothers of Kumar*. According to SP, they are his very self. SP. RS. iv. 33-25*

V.S Agrawal gives quite a different interpretation. According to him Kumara is the symbol of the life-principle manifesting in every individual. Kptikas are the six yogic eakras located in the human body in the golden reed. Kumara who is born in this six-jointed single reed is called (i) Karttikcya and (ii) &#x26;ikha. The life-principle then branches out in the form of five grass elements and the mind which together are called (iii) Vi&#x26;kha. As the popular God of the merchant community Kumara is called (iv) Naigama or Naigamcya.

26. Then the four of great heroic strength including Skanda rushed to attack Indra. I offered my protection to Indra.

27. Afraid of Guha, Indra with all the gods went away to his region agitatedly. O sage, he did not know his secret.

28. That boy remained there itself as fearless as before. O dear, he was highly pleased and continued his divine sports of various sorts.

29. Meanwhile the six ladies named Krttikas came there for bath and they saw the lordly boy.

30. All of them desired to take and fondle him. O sage, as a result of their simultaneous desire for taking and fondling the boy, a dispute arose.

31. In order to quell their mutual dispute, the boy assumed six faces and drank milk off their breasts. O sage, they were all satisfied.

32-33. Realising his desire, the Krttikas, sage, took to their region joyously. Feeding him with their breast milk they nursed and nurtured Siva’s son who was more refulgent than the sun.

34. They never let him go out of their sight. He became the object of their love, dearer to them than their own lives. Verily he who nurses and nurtures the child has the right of possession over the son. 137

35. With great love they gave him the rarest garments and excellent ornaments in the three worlds.

36. Feeding him specially on the choicest delicacies day by day they brought up the boy prodigy.

37. O dear, once that son of the Krttikas went to the celestial assembly and showed wonderful feats.

38. The boy of wonderful miracles showed his rare splendour to the gods including Vifnu.

39-40. On seeing him, the gods and sages including Vi$nu became surprised and asked the boy “Pray, who are you?” On hearing it he did not say anything in reply. He returned to his abode and remained concealed as before.

137. Verses 34-36 of this chapter are the same as verses 31-32 of the following chapter.

O sage, after the son of Siva had been taken over by the Krttikas some time elapsed but the daughter of Himavat had no knowledge of the same.
Meanwhile Parvati beaming with her lotus like face told her husband Siva, the lord of the gods.

Pdrvati said:

O lord of the gods, listen to my auspicious words. Lord, you have been attained by me, thanks to my previous merits.
Although you are the most excellent among the Yogins, O lord, you became desirous of dalliance. But my dalliance with you was interrupted in the middle by the gods.
O lord, your semen fell on the ground and not in my womb. Where did it go? Among the gods by whom could it have been concealed?
O lord, infallible is your semen, how can it be fruitless? Or has it developed into a child somewhere?

Brahmd said:

O great sage, on hearing the words of Parvati, the lord of the universe called the gods and the sages and laughingly said to them.

Lord Siva said:

O gods, listen to my words. Has Pdrvati’s statement been heard by you? Where has my unfailing semen gone? By whom has it been concealed?
If he, out of fear, falls at my feet quickly he may not be punished. If a king, competent enough, does

Vi$nu said:

12. Let those who have concealed your semen incur the sins of those who utter lies, of those who outrage the modesty of preceptor’s wife, and of those who are engaged in insulting the preceptor always.

Brahmd said:

13. Let him who has concealed your semen anywhere in the holy centres of Bharata be debarred from the privilege of serving or worshipping you.

The guardians of the quarters said:

14. Let him who has concealed your semen suffer continuously from the pang as a result of that sinful action. lsf

The gods said:

The wives of the gods said:

16. Let her who has concealed your semen be deprived of mother and kinsmen and incur the sin of those base women who hate their husband and carry on an affair with another man.

Lord Siva said:

1. The infallible semen of mine, has not been concealed by the gods. By whom could it then have been concealed?
2. All of you are the witnesses of all actions always. Has it been concealed by you? Have you come to know of it? Please narrate.
3. On hearing the words of Siva they nervously looked at one another and spoke before the lord one by one.

Brahma said:

The infallible semen of Siva, infuriated at the intervention in the course of his sexual dalliance, fell on the ground. This was observed by me.

The Earth said:

I was unable to bear the terrible semen. Hence I dropped it into the fire. O lord, please forgive me.

The fire said:

O Siva, assuming the form of a dove I gulped the semen but could not bear the terrible thing. Hence I immediately dropped it on the mountain Kailasa.

The mountain said:

O lord of the worlds, I too was unable to bear the terrible thing. O lord, I dropped it in the Ganga.

Ganga said:

O lord of the worlds, I too was unable to bear your terrible semen. O lord, completely exhausted, I dropped it in the grove of Sara plants.

The waters said: —

29. O lord, taking the crying child with them and feeding him with their own breast milk they nurtured your son, as refulgent as the sun.

The dusk said:

30. Now, he is the nursling son of the Krttikas in the forest. In their eagerness they named him Karttikeya lovingly.

The night said:

31. They never let the boy go out of their sight. He is the object of their love, dearer to them than their own lives. Verily he who nurtures, possesses the son.

The day said:

32. They fed him on the choicest delicacies. They gave him the rarest garments and excellent ornaments.

Brahmd said —

sent his Ganas as his emissaries to the place where his son was staying. O Narada, he sent Vrabhadra, ViSalaksa, Sankukarna, Parakrama, Nandisvara, Mahakala, Vajradarhstra, Mahonmada, Gokarnasya, Dadhimukha who was comparable to the blazing flame of fire, a hundred thousand Ksetrapalas, three hundred thousand Bhutas, Rudras, Bhairavas, and innumerable others of the same exploit as that of Siva and of hideous features.

All the emissaries of Siva went and haughtily encircled the abode of the Krttikas with various miraculous weapons in their hands.

On seeing them the Krttikas were extremely terrified. They spoke to Karttikeya blazing with divine splendour.

# Krttikas said:

Dear boy, innumerable soldiers have encircled the house. What shall be done? Where are we to go? A great danger has beset us.

O good women, O mothers, cast off your fear. When I am here what fear need you have? Although I am a boy I am invincible. Who can thwart me?

At that time Parvatl addressed Siva the benefactor of all, in that assembly urging a search for you.

Siva asked the assembly severally about you in

order to get you back. They too replied in a suitable manner.

49. They said to Siva that you were here in the abode of Krttikas. Dharma and others who are the cosmic witnesses of all righteous and unrighteous activities revealed your whereabouts.

50. Formerly Parvati and Siva indulged in their secret sexual dalliance. The semen of Siva seen by the gods fell on the ground.

51. The earth dropped it into the fire, the fire on the mountain, the mountain in the Gariga and the Gariga transmitted it to the grove of Sara plants by her following currents and waves.

52. There you developed into a boy, the lord with the mission of fulfilling the task of the gods. There you were picked up by the Krttikas. Now you shall come down to the Earth.

53. Siva will be crowning you in the company of the gods. You will get miraculous weapons and will slay the demon Taraka.

54. You are the son of the annihilator of the universe and these (Krttikas) are impatient to gain possession of you as the dry tree tries to conceal fire within its hollow though it is incapable of holding it.

55. You are brilliant enough to illuminate the universe. You do not fit in well in this abode just as a majestic elephant fallen in a deep well does not retain splendour.

56. You can shed splendour if your brilliance is not hidden just as the sun illuminates the world only when it is not hidden by the cloud.

57. In the matter of omnipresence in the universe you alone are Visnu, O Siva’s son. The all-pervading sky is not pervaded by anything else.

58. A Yogin is not entangled in the activities of nurturing himself. The soul is not involved in the physical activities.

59. You are the creator of the universe, you are the lord. Your place is not among these. You are a mass of attributes and splendour as the soul of a Yogin.

60. O brother, those who do not know you are of

damned intellect. Although the toads and lotuses are in the same pond toads are not honoured.

Kdrttikeya said:

1. O brother, you know everything. You are perfectly wise possessing the knowledge of the past, present and future, since you are an attendant of Siva. Hence no praise of yours is specially called for.
2. O brother, people get reconciled to whatever form of species of life they are born. Their own actions are responsible for their birth and they are satisfied.
3. The Krttikas are wise women of Yogic practice. They are the digits of Prakrti. They have helped in nurturing me with their own breast milk.
4. I am their fostered son. They are my own part and parcel. I am born of Prakrti and the semen of the lord of Prakrti.
5. O NandikeSvara, I am not severed from the daughter of the lord of mountains who is virtually my mother just as these ladies on the basis of virtuous rites.
6. You have been sent by Siva. You are like a son unto Siva. I am coming with you. I shall see the gods.
7. After saying so and hurriedly taking leave of the Kfttikas, Karttikeya started along with the attendants of Siva.

of lord Siva, the perfectly wise and endless being, got into it.

4. At the same time, the distressed grief-stricken Krttikas approached him with dishevelled hair and began to speak like mad women.

Krttikas said:

5. O ocean of mercy, how is it that you ruthlessly leave us and go? This is not a virtuous thing for a fostered son to forsake his mothers.

6. You have been brought up by us affectionately. Hence you are our son in virtue of that. What shall we do? Where shall we go? What can we do?

7. After saying this and closely embracing Karttikeya, the Krttikas fell into a swoon due to the imminent separation from their son.

8. Restoring them to consciousness and instructing them with spiritual utterances, O sage, he got into the chariot along with them and the Parsadas too.

9. Seeing and hearing various auspicious and pleasing things Kumara went to the palace of his father along with the Parsadas.

10. Kumara reached the foot of a Nyagrodha tree at Kailasa in the fast chariot along with Nandin seated to his right.

11. There Kumara, the son of Siva, an expert in various divine sports, waited along with the Krttikas and the chief of Parsadas, in great delight.

12. Then all the gods, sages, Siddhas, Caranas, Visnu and Brahma announced his arrival.

13. Then in order to see him Siva, along with Visnu, Brahma, the gods, sages and others went there.

Shouting cries of “Victory” and “Obeisance” the delighted people went to see the excellent son of Siva born in the grove of Sara plants. 140

# 18.

Parvati caused the entire outskirts of the city fully decorated with Padmaraga and other gems. The main highway was rendered beautiful and auspicious.

# 19.

The thirty goddesses Laksmi and others stood in front along with chaste ladies whose husbands and sons were alive and Parvati stood ahead of them.

# 20.

At the bidding of Parvati, the smiling celestial damsels, Rambha and others, dressed gorgeously, were engaged in singing and dancing.

Those who looked at Kumara resembling Siva saw a great halo pervading the three worlds.

Immediately they saluted Kumara who was enveloped by the brilliant halo, the lustre of molten gold and the refulgence of the sun.

With shoulders stooping down and eagerly engaged in shouting the cry of “Obeisance” they flanked him to the right and left and stood by.

# 27.

On seeing Parvati and Siva, Harttikeya got down from the chariot immediately and saluted them.

# 28.

Embracing him with love, Siva kissed Kumara on the head, he, the cause of great affection, was highly delighted.

# 29.

Embracing him in great excitement and melting with love, Parvati suckled him at her breasts.

140. Kumara is said to be born of Siva’s semen that was first swallowed by the Firr assuming the form of a pigeon, then by the Krttik&#x26;s, the six wives of the sages, then by Gan^a who deposited it in the reedt. Kumara is thus called 3n^jy, *TT*PT and I

36. Seeing that sportive act with his merciful vision, lord Siva spoke about it to Parvati laughingly.

37. Seeing the gentle smile of Kumara, lord Siva and Parvati attained great joy. The lord, the sole ruler of the worlds and kinsman of the universe uttered nothing with his throat choked through affection.

38. Then Siva, the lord of the universe, following the worldly convention delightedly placed Karttikcya on a beautiful gemset throne.

"O lord, Taraka will certainly be killed by Kumara. It is for that purpose that he is born.

# 58.

Hence in our effort to kill him we shall start this very day. Please give your directions to Kumara. Let him slay Taraka for our happiness.

# 59.

Thinking that it shall be so, lord Siva entrusted his son to the gods in order to kill Taraka, urged by his mercy that he was.

# 60.

At the bidding of Siva, Brahma, Visnu and other gods jointly started from the mountain keeping Kumara in front.

# 61.

After coming out of Kailasa, at the behest of Visnu, Tvastr built a wonderfully fine city very near the mountain.

# CHAPTER SIX

# (The miraculous feat of Kdrttikeya)

Brahma said:

1. There Kumara showed a miraculous feat. O Narada, listen to it that bestows devotion.
2. Then a certain brahmin Narada came there, seeking refuge in Kumara. He was glorious and had been performing a sacrifice.
3. Approaching Kumara, bowing to and eulogising him with auspicious hymns the delighted brahmin related his tale.

The brahmin said:

O lord, listen to my words. Relieve my distress. You are the lord of the universe. I seek refuge in you.
I began a goat sacrifice. The goat got loosened and strayed away from my house.
I do not know where it has gone. I have searched for it here and there but have not found it. Hence this will cause a serious default in my sacrifice.
While you are the lord, how can there be an obstacle to my sacrifice? O lord, after pondering over this matter please fulfil my task.
O lord, O son of Siva, who else can I approach except you, who are worthy of being resorted to, who are the lord of the entire universe and are served by all the gods. You kinsman You,
are the of the distressed. are worthy of being served well. You are favourably disposed to your devotees. You are the great lord eulogised by Visnu, Brahma and other gods. You are Skanda the delighter of Parvati, the sole destroyer of enemies, the great soul, the lord who bestows his own self upon the good seeking refuge in him.
O lord of the distressed, O great lord, O son of Siva, O lord of the three worlds, O master of magical art, I have to seek refuge in you. O favourite of the brahmins, save me. You are the lord of all. You are eulogised by

15. Even the preceptor of the gods cannot eulogise you adequately. Then tell me, how can I a foolish and wretched creature? O Skanda, pure or impure, noble or ignoble, of whatever nature I be, I pray unto the dust of your lotus-like feet.

O lord, you know even the slightest act of devotion done anywhere. O You are the destroyer of the distress of your servants.

22. You are the joy of Parvati, the son of Siva. You are the perfect wisdom, the self-ruler, the meditator and the object of meditation. You are the father of the fathers and the source of origin of good souls.

Brahma said:

23. On hearing his words, Siva’s son, the emperor of the gods, sent his attendant Virabahu on that mission.

24. At his bidding, the great hero Virabahu who bowed to his master with devotion started in search of it.

25. He searched throughout the universe but nowhere did he find the goat (although) he heard about the havoc done by it.

26. Then he went to Vaikuntha where he saw the powerful goat working havoc with the sacrificial stake tied to its neck.

27. The hero dragged it catching hold of its horns and brought it quickly before his lord even as it was bleating loudly.

28. On seeing it, lord Karttikeya who could carry the weighty universe, and the worker of great miracles, quickly rode on it.

Rudrasamhita 741

29. Within a Muhurta, O sage, the goat walked round the universe and without exhaustion returned to the same place.

30. Then the lord got down and resumed his seat. The goat stood there itself. Then the brahmin Narada told the lord.

JVarada said:

31. Obeisance to you, O lord of gods, O storehouse of mercy, give the goat to me. Let me perform the sacrifice with pleasure. Please assist me as my friend.

Kdrtlikeya said:

32. O brahmin Narada, this goat does not deserve to be killed. Return home. May your sacrifice be complete. It has been so ordained by my favour.

Brahma said:

33. On hearing the words of the lord, the brahmin was delighted. He returned home after bestowing his excellent blessings.

5. Then a celestial voice, prompted by Siva addressed Visnu and all other gods. The celestial Voice said;

6. O gods, keeping Kumara at the head you have entered the lists. Defeating the Asuras in the battle, you will be victorious.

Brahma said:

7. On hearing the celestial voice, the gods became enthusiastic. Fearlessly they roared like heroes.

8. With their fear subsided, and keeping Kumara ahead, the gods went to the confluence of the river Mahi and the ocean desirous of fighting.

9. Immediately Taraka, along with a great army, came to the place where the gods stood and was surrounded by them in a body.

10. Battle drums were sounded as loud as the rumbling sound of the clouds at the dissolution of the world. The harsh musical instruments were also played when he came.

11. The Asuras in the company of Taraka roared and shook the ground with their thudding footsteps, leapings and bouncings.

12. Undaunted by that terrible noise, the gods simultaneously rose up to fight Taraka.

13. Accompanied by the great army of the gods and the guardians of the quarters, lord Indra seated Kumara on an elephant and rushed forward.

14. Great wardrums, Dundubhis, Bheris and Turyas, lutes, flutes and Mrdangas were sounded and the Gandharvas sang war songs.

15. Leaving the elephant to lord Indra, Kumara got in an aerial chariot of wonderful build and studded with different sets of gems.

16. Seated in the aerial chariot, the son of Siva

14*. The scene of the battle between the gods and Asuras is placed in the Western India on the coast of the Arabian sea where the sacred river Mahi that issues from Saliynpf.da hill falls into it. For details see Dr. Avasthi: Studies in Skandapui apa, pp. 126, 140, 160, 160.

Endowed with good qualities and of great renown shone with great splendour. He was being fanned with lustrous chowries.

17. The lustrous umbrella presented by Varuna, shining with various gems was held aloft over his head. Beams of light as though of infinite moons shed great lustre around.

18. Indra and other gods of great strength, desirous of fighting, joined him with their own divisions of the army.

19. The gods and the demons stood in their arrays on the ground with a vast army ready to start the battle.

20. With the bards singing their songs of praise, the armies of the gods and the Asuras shone in their eagerness to pounce on and crush each other.

21. The two armies as vast as a wild jungle roared. They were terrific to the coward and pleasing to the brave.

22. In the meantime the rank and file of the Asuras and the gods, haughty of their strength and blazing with fury came together in a mutual clash.

23. A terrific tumultuous fight between the gods and the Asuras ensued. Within a moment the place was littered with severed heads and headless trunks.

24. Wounded and killed by great weapons, hundreds and thousands of heroic soldiers fell on the ground.

25. The arms of some were cut off by terrible blows from swords. Others lost their thighs in the battle of those honourable, heroic people.

26. The entire body of some was smashed by the mace; the chests and hearts of some were pounded by iron clubs; some were felled to the ground by spears and dragged with nooses.

27. The backs of some were torn with javelins and goads. Several heads chopped off by double-edged swords fell on the ground.

28. Hundreds of headless, limbless trunks were seen dancing and bouncing with arrows sticking to their hands.

29. Blood flowed like streams in hundreds of places. Hundreds of ghosts and goblins flocked there.

30. Jackals and vixens began eating the flesh. Numbers

31. In the meantime Taraka, the demon of great strength, came there with a huge army to fight with the gods.

32. On seeing the haughty warrior rushing on them, Indra and others turned against him. Then a tumultuous sound arose from both the armies.

33. Duels were fought by the gods and the Asuras crushing each other, on seeing which heroes were delighted and cowards were terrified.

34. The Asura Taraka of great strength fought with Indra, Samhrada with Agni and Yama with Jambha.

35. Lord Varuna fought with Nairpta and Bala. Suvira, the king of Guhyas, fought with Vayu.

37. Kufijara of great strength and exploit, an expert in different kinds of battles, fought with Mihira, using great weapons.

38. Thus the gods and the Asuras fought duels using their full strength with resolution.

39. O sage, desiring to gain the upper hand and vying with each other, the powerful gods and the Asuras were equally invincible in the battle.

40. The fight between the gods and the Asuras desirous of victory over each other was very tumultuous. It was pleasing to the brave and terrible to the others.

# CHAPTER EIGHT

# (The battle between the gods and Asuras)

Brahma said:

1. O Narada, O dear, thus I have described to you the fight between the rank and file of both the armies of the gods and Asuras. The fight was very tumultuous. Now listen to the fight between the two leaders on either side.

2-3. In the tumultuous fight that ensued reducing the numbers of the gods and the demons, lord Indra struck by the great spear fell from his elephant and became unconscious. The thunderbolt-bearing lord of gods attained great depression of spirits and swooned. O

4. In the same manner, dear, the guardians of the quarters, though powerful, were defeated in battle by the Asuras, great experts in warfare.

5. The other gods too were fought and defeated by the Asuras. Unable to bear their ferocity they took to flight.

6. The victorious Asuras, their effort having been successful, roared like lions and raised shouts of jubilation.

7. In the meantime Virabhadra reached the place furiously along with his heroic Ganas and approached Taraka who professed to be a great hero.

8. The leader of the Ganas, the strong one born of the anger of Siva, kept the gods in the rear and faced Taraka desirous of fighting him.

9. Then the Pramathas and the jubilant Asuras, fond of great battle, fought one another.

10. Skilled adepts in warfare they hit and smashed one another with tridents, double-edged swords, nooses, axes and sharp-edged spikes.

11. Immediately after being hit hard with a trident by Virabhadra, Taraka fell unconscious on the ground.

12. Regaining consciousness quickly Taraka the excellent Asura got up and forcefully hit Virabhadra with his spear.

13. In the same manner, the heroic Virabhadra of great brilliance hit Taraka with his sharp terrible trident.

# Sivapur&#x26;na

14. The powerful king of the Asuras, the heroic Taraka, hit Virabhadra again with spear.

15. Fighting each other thus they hit each other with various weapons and missiles both being equally skilful in the art of warfare.

16. Even as others stood gazing, the two of great energy continued their duel causing hair to stand on ends, with tumultuous noise.

17. Then various military bands and drums like Bheris, Mrdangas, Pafahas, Anakas and Gomukhas were sounded by the soldiers terrifying those who happened to hear.

18. Both of them were severely wounded by the mutual hits and thrusts but still they continued their fight with added vigour like Mercury and Mars.

19. On seeing the fight between him and Virabhadra, you, the favourite of Siva went there and said to Virabhadra, Ndrada said:

20. “O Virabhadra, of great heroism, you are the leader of the Ganas. Please desist from this fight. Your killing him does not fit in properly.”

21. On hearing your words, the leader of the Ganas Virabhadra became furious but spoke to you with palms joined in reverence.

Virabhadra said:

22. O excellent sage, of great wisdom, listen to my weighty words. I will kill Taraka. See my exploit today.

23. The soldiers who bring their masters to the battle-field are sinners. They are no better than eunuchs. They are doomed in the battle.

24. They will go the way of the wicked. Hell is definitely in store for them. Virabhadra should never be considered by you as such a despicable person.

145. Virabhadra, the chief of the ganas of Siva has become a mythical Being. In the scriptures in the caves of Elephanta and Ellora he is represented with eight hands. According to tradition, he was created by Siva to destroy Dakya's sacrifice, to harry away the Gods and sages who had assembled there. Dawson: H. M.

In the present context he figures as a prominent combatant on the aide of the Gods against the Asura chief Taraka.

25. Those whose bodies are rent and split with weapons and missiles, but who still fight fearlessly shall be praised here and hereafter. They derive wonderful happiness.

26. Let Visnu and other gods listen to my words — I shall make the earth freed of Taraka today even without bringing my master here.

27. Saying thus and taking up his trident, Virabhadra mentally meditated on Siva and fought with Taraka, accompanied by Pramathas.

28. With many heroic soldiers riding on bulls, wielding the tridents and possessing three eyes he shone well in the midst of that battle.

29. Keeping Virabhadra at their head, and shouting fearlessly jubilantly, hundreds of the Ganas fought with the Asuras.

30. The Asuras too, the dependants of the demon Taraka, all equally strong and heroic, began to smash the Ganas furiously.

31. The terrific mutual fights between the demons and the Ganas happened again and again. Ultimately the Ganas, experts in the use of great missiles, came out victorious and were jubilant.

32. Defeated by the Ganas of great strength, the Asuras turned their faces and began to flee. They were distressed and agitated.

33. On seeing his army vanishing thus in flight, their protector, the Asura Taraka, furiously rushed at the gods and the Ganas.

34. He assumed ten thousand hands and rode on a lion. In the battle that followed he felled the gods and the Ganas quickly.

35-36. On seeing such a perpetration of Taraka, Virabhadra, the leader of the Ganas, became very furious. In order to kill him he took up his trident after remembering the lotuslike feet of Siva. His brilliance then brightly illuminated all the quarters and the sky.

37. In the meantime, the master prevented Virabahu and others immediately in order to stop the war.

38. At his bidding Virabhadra returned from the battle.

# Sivapur&#x26;na

The heroic leader of the Asuras, Taraka, was still in his unabated fury.

39. Then the Asura showered arrows on the gods and put them to distress. He was skilful in the use of various missiles in the war.

40. After causing a great havoc, Taraka, the protector of Asuras, the most excellent among the brave, seemed invincible to the gods.

41. On seeing the gods terrified and slaughtered, Visnu became furious and got ready to fight.

42. Taking discus SudarSana, the bow Sariiga and other weapons with him, lord Visnu rushed to meet the great Asura in the battle.

43. O sage, a great fight ensued between Visnu and Taraka. It was very fierce. It caused horripilation to the onlookers.

44. Lifting up his club, Visnu hit the Asura with great force but the powerful Asura split it with his trident.

45. The infuriated lord offering shelter to the gods hit the leader of the Asuras by arrows discharged from his bow.

46. The heroic Asura Taraka, the slaver of enemies, immediately split the arrows of the gods by his own sharp arrows.

47. The Asura Taraka then quickly hit Visnu with his spear. On being hit thus, Visnu fell unconscious on the ground.

48. In a trice, Visnu got up and in rage seized his discus that was blazing with flames and he roared like a lion.

49. Visnu hit the king of Asuras with it. Overwhelmed by the forceful hit he fell on the ground.

50. Getting up again, the foremost among Asuras and their leader, Taraka using all his strength immediately split the discus with his spear.

51. Again he struck Visnu the favourite of the gods with that great spear. The heroic Visnu hit him back with Nandaka.

146. Murlri: ‘The enemy of Mura’. It is an appellation of Visnu who slew the Asura Mura. The latter was an ally of the Asura Naraka who ruled over Prigjyotii (modern Assam).

O sage, both Visnu and the Asura, equally powerful, hit each other in the battle with unabated strength.

# CHAPTER NINE

(The boasting of Tdraka and the fight between him and Indra, Vifnu, Virabhadra)

Brahma said:

1. O Guha, O lord of gods, O son of Siva and Parvati, the fight between Visnu and Taraka is not proper. It is futile.
2. Taraka the powerful cannot be killed by Visnu. He has been granted such a boon by me. It is truth. I am telling you the truth.
3. O son of Parvati, none except you can be the slayer of this sinner. O great lord, my words shall be carried out by you.
4. O scorcher of enemies, please get ready to slay him. Son of Parvati you are born of Siva for killing that demon.
5. O great hero, save the gods distressed in the battle. You are neither a boy nor a youth but the lord of all.
6. See Indra and Visnu. They are agitated and distressed, so also the gods and the Ganas. Slay this great demon. Make the three worlds happy.
7. Formerly Indra and the guardians of the quarters conquered due to the power of his penance, the heroic Visnu too has been threatened by him.
8. The entire universe of the three worlds has been defeated by this wicked Asura. Now, because of your presence, they have fought again.
9. Hence, O son of Siva, this sinful being Taraka shall be killed by you. Due to the boon granted by me he cannot be slain by anyone else.

Brahma said: On hearing these words of mine, Kumara, son of Siva, was delighted and he laughed. “So be it”, said he.

# Sivapurdna

11. Resolving to kill the Asura, the great lord, son of Siva got down from the aerial chariot and stood on the ground.

12. Running on foot, seizing his lustrous spear blazing like a meteor, the powerful warrior Kumara born of Siva shone well.

13. On seeing the incomprehensible six-headed deity coming forward, fierce and unagitated, the Asura spoke to the gods derisively — “O this child indeed will slay the enemies!”

14. I will fight with him single-handed. I will kill the soldiers, the Ganas and the guardians of the quarters led by Vi$nu.

15. Saying thus, the powerful Asura rushed at Kumara to fight with him. Taraka seized his wonderful spear and spoke to the gods.

Taraka said:

16. “How is it that you all kept Kumara face to face with me? You gods are shameless especially Indra and Vi$nu.

17. Formerly, both of them had acted in violation of the Vedic path. Listen. I shall describe the same.

18. Vi$nu is deceptive, defective and indiscreet. It was by him that Bali147 was formerly bound by taking recourse to deception with sinful intention.

19. The Asuras Madhu and Kaitabha148 were beheaded by his roguishness. He forsook the Vedic path.

20. When the gods and Asuras sat for drinking the nectar it was he who violated the sanctity of the vows when he assumed the form of an enchantress.149 Thus he slighted the Vedic path.

147. Bali, the son of Virocana, was an Asura-chief. He was deceived by Vi$nu in the form of a dwarfish Brahmin. The latter asked Bali to grant him three steps of ground and Bali consenting, the dwarf stepped and covered heaven and earth in two strides. However, he desisted from taking the third step and left the nether region for Bali’s sake.

148. Madhu and Kaitabha were the two demons sprung from the ear of Vi$nu while he was asleep at the end of a Kalpa. They were about to kill Brahma but were treacherously killed by Vi$nu and thrown into the sea.

149. In the guise of an enchantress, Vi$nu deprived Asuras of their right of drinking nectar produced from churning the ocean.

In his sixth incarnation (as Parasurama) he cut off the head of his own mother. This wicked man insulted his own preceptor’s son.

# 24.

Incarnating as Krsna he defiled the wives of others and forced them to violate the traditional virtues of the family. He contracted his marriages without any reference to the Vedic path.

# 25.

Again in his ninth incarnation he slighted the Vedic path and contrary to its principles, preached and established the atheistic philosophy called Buddhism.

# 26.

How can he be considered an excellent, virtuous man, how can he be victorious in battle who has committed sin without caring for Vedic cult?

# 27.

Indra, his elder brother, is a greater sinner. He has committed many sins for his self-interest.

# 28.

To gain his selfish end, by him Dili’s foetus was destroyed; the modesty of Gautama’s wife was outraged, Vftra, the son of a brahmin, was killed.

He beheaded the brahmin Viivarupa,157 the nephew of Bfhaspati. Thus he transgressed the Vedic path.

# 30.

Doing such sinful acts frequently Vi$nu and Siva are already deficient in splendour and their prowess is spent out.

# 31.

You will never gain victory in the battle by relying on them. Why then did you foolishly come here to lose your lives?

# 32.

These two, always seeking selfish ends, do not know what is virtue. O gods, without virtue every rite becomes futile.

# 33.

These two impudent fellows are presumptuous enough to place a child in front of me. Why? I will kill the child too. They too will have it.

# 34.

But let the child leave from here and save his life.” After saying this, hinting at Indra and Visnu he turned to Virabhadra and said.

53. The trident had a halo around, like that of the sun, the moon and the fire. It illuminated the quarters by means of its brilliance; caused terror even in the hearts of the brave. It had a deadly splendour and blazed well.

54. When the powerful Virabhadra was about to hit the Asura with his trident, he was prevented by Kumara.

3. Shouts of victory were raised by the gods and the Ganas. He was eulogised by the celestial sages with pleasing words.
4. The fight between Taraka and Kumara was terrific and unbearable. All the living beings were afraid.
5. O sage, even as all the persons stood gazing wonderingly, both of them fought each other with spears in their hands.
6. Each was wounded in the heart by the other with the spear. Each tried to escape from the other’s thrust. Both were equally strong like two lions. Both were fully equipped for the fight.
7. They fought and hit each other’s spear taking recourse to the mantras Vaitalika, Khecaraka, Praptika etc.
8. With these mantras they were possessed of magical properties. They wonderfully fought each other using their full strength and exploits.

12. All the gods Gandharvas and Kinnaras stood as mere onlookers. “Who will win this battle?” they asked each other.

13. Then a celestial voice rose appeasing the gods. “In this battle Kumara will kill the Asura Taraka. None of the gods need be anxious. All shall rest assured. For your welfare Siva Himself is standing here in the form of His son.”

14. On hearing the auspicious words uttered by the celestial voice, Kumara became happy. He was surrounded by the Prainathas. He resolved to kill Taraka, the king of Asuras.

15. The infuriated Kumara of powerful arms used his full strength and hit Asura Taraka in between his nipples.

16. Slighting that blow, the leading demon Taraka hit Kumara angrily with his spear.

17. At the blow of the spear, the son of Siva became unconscious. He regained his consciousness in a few minutes. He was eulogised by the great sages.

18. Kumara became furious like a maddened lion and was desirous of killing the Asura. The powerful Kumara hit Taraka with his Spear.

19. Thus both Kumara and Taraka equally inflamed and equally well versed in the battle of spears fought each other.

20. Both appeared to possess plenty of practice. Both had the desire to gain the upper hand. Both fought on foot, had wonderful forms and features and were equally courageous.

21. With massive heaps of fatal missiles they hit each other. They had various ways of attack. They roared. They exhibited their all exploits.

22. The onlookers, the gods, the Gandharvas and the Kinnaras were much surprised. They did not speak anything there.

23. The wind did not blow. The sun became dim. Earth quaked along with mountains and forests.

24. In the meantime Himalaya and other mountains anxious to see Kumara out of affection came there.

25. On seeing the mountains extremely terrified,

Kumara the son of Siva and Parvati spoke enlightening them thereby.

Kumara said:

1. O mountains, O fortunate sirs, do not be vexed, or worried. Even as you stand looking on I will kill this sinner,
2. Consoling the mountains, the gods and the Ganas thus, and bowing to Siva and Parvati he took up his brilliant spear.
3. The heroic Kumara, son of Siva the great lord, with the spear in his hand shone in his resolve to kill Taraka.
4. Possessing the brilliance of Siva, Kumara with his spear struck Taraka who had harassed the worlds.
5. Immediately the Asura Taraka the ruler of the hosts of Asuras, although very heroic, fell on the ground with all his limbs shattered.
6. The great warrior Taraka was slain by Kumara. O sage, even as all were looking on, he passed away.
7. On seeing the powerful Asura fallen dead in the battle, the hero did not go and attack him again.
8. When the powerful Asura was slain, other Asuras were killed by gods and Ganas.
9. Some of the Asuras who were afraid joined their palms in reverence. In the battle the limbs of many Asuras were chopped off and severed. Thousands were killed too.
10. Some of the Asuras shrieking “O save O save” with palms joined in reverence sought refuge in Kumara.
11. Numberless Asuras were killed. Many fled. The fleeing Asuras were beaten and harassed by the gods and the Ganas.
12. Thousands of them fled to Patala for their life. Those who tried to flee were disappointed and put to distress.
13. O great sage, thus the entire army of the Asuras disappeared. None dared to remain there for fear of the gods and the Ganas.
14. When the wicked Asura was killed, the whole universe became freed of thorns, freed from the danger and nuisance of the Asuras. Indra and other gods became happy.

Thus when Kumara came out victorious the gods were happy. The three worlds attained great pleasure.

# 42.

On knowing about the victory of Kartikeya, Siva came there joyously with his beloved and the Ganas.

# 43.

He took his son on his lap and fondled him with pleasure. Parvati in her flutter of affection took Kumara, resplendent as the sun, on her lap and fondled him with pleasure.

Then Himavat came there along with his sons, kinsmen and servants. He eulogised Siva and Guha.

# 45.

The delighted gods, Ganas and sages, Siddhas and Caranas eulogised Parvati, Siva and the son of Siva.

# 46.

The secondary gods poured a great shower of flowers. The chiefs of Gandharvas sang. The celestial damsels danced.

# 47.

The musical instruments were played sweetly then. Frequent loud shouts of “Victory” and “Obeisance” were raised.

# 48.

Vishnu too in my company was very glad. He respectfully eulogised Siva, Parvati and Kumara.

# 49.

Keeping Kumara in front, Brahma, Indra and other gods performed the rite of Nirajana lovingly. Other sages too did likewise.

# 50.

Then there was great jubilation with vocal and instrumental music and chantings of the Vedas. Hymns too were sung.

# 51.

The lord of the universe eulogised, sage, the delighted gods and Ganas by means of vocal and instrumental music.

Then eulogised by all, lord Siva along with Parvati the mother of the universe, went to his mountain surrounded by the Ganas.

# CHAPTER ELEVEN

# (The Victory of Kumara and the death of Bana and Pralamba)

Brahma said:

1. O sage, in the meantime the mountain Krauftca, harassed by Bana came there and sought refuge in Kumara.
2. This Bana had been fleeing from the previous battle, unable to bear the brilliance of the lord. He with the army of ten thousand persons, inflicted pain on Krauftca with the tip of his missiles.
3. The mountain Krauftca devoutly bowed at the lotus-like feet of Kumara and eulogised him with reverence with words full of love.

Krauftca said:

O Kumara, O Skanda, O lord of gods, O slayer of the Asura Taraka protect me who have sought refuge in you. I am harassed by the Asura Bana.
O Mahasena, O lord, O merciful one, routed and uprooted from the battle with you he came and harassed me.
Afflicted by him I have run from him and sought refuge in you. O lord of gods, born amongst the reeds, be merciful.
O lord, please slay the Asura Bana. Make me happy. You are the slayer of Asuras and a special saviour of the gods. You are a self-ruler.

Brahma said:

Skanda who was thus eulogised by Krauftca became delighted. He, the saviour of the devotees, took up his matchless spear and remembered Siva.
The son of Siva hurled the spear aiming at Bana. It gave loud report, blazing forth the quarters and the sky.
O sage, reducing the Asuras to ashes along with his army in a trice, the great spear returned to Kumara.
The lord Kumara told Krauftca, the chief of the...

mountains, “Go home fearlessly. That Asura has been slain along with his army.”

12. On hearing the words of the lord, the delighted lord of the mountains eulogised Kumara the slayer of his enemy and went back to his abode. and observing

13. sage, with great pleasure the rules Skanda installed three phallic emblems of Siva that quell all sins.

14. The first is called Pratijftesvara, the second Kapalevara and the last Kumare^vara. The three are capable of conferring all the achievements.

15. Thereafter Kumara, the lord of all, joyously installed the phallic image Stambheivara, near the column of victory.

16. Then Vijnu and other gods joyously installed the phallic emblem of Siva, the lord of the gods.

17. The glory of the phallic emblems of Siva was marvellous, conferring all cherished desires and salvation to the devotees.

18. Then the delighted Visnu and the gods desired to go to the chief of mountains joyously putting Brhaspati ahead.

19. Then Kumuda the son of Sesa who was harassed by the Asuras came and sought refuge in Kumara.

20. Another follower of Taraka— Pralamba who had fled from the previous battle wrought great havoc with full force.

21. Kumuda, the great son of Sesa the lord of serpents, sought refuge in Kumara the son of Parvati and eulogised him. Kumuda said:

22. O excellent son of great lord, lord of the gods,

159* The four phallic images of Siva named Prat'j Acs vara, Kap&#x26;lcsvara, Kumareivara and Stamhhesvara were set up at Cambay, the scene of the battlefield, to commemorate the Victory of Gulia over Tiraka, the Asura-chief.

160. According to this account, Kumuda, the son of the serpent-chief Sesa, was troubled by the Asura Pralamba who was the ally of Tiraka. Kumuda slew Pralamba and relieved Kumuda of distress. This Pralamba is distinct from the Asura of the same name whose destruction at the hands of Balarama is recorded in the Mahabharata.

great chief, I am afflicted by Pralamba and am seeking refuge in you.

23. O Kumara, O Skanda, O lord of the gods, O great lord, O slayer of Taraka, save me harassed by the Asura Pralamba and seeking refuge in you.

24. You are the kinsman of the distressed, the ocean of mercy, favourably disposed to the devotees, the slayer of the wicked, worthy of refuge and the goal of the good.

25. Eulogised thus by Kumuda and requested to slay the demon Pralamba, the lord took up his spear after remembering the lotus-like feet of Siva.

26. The son of Parvati hurled the spear at Pralamba. It made a loud report. The quarters and the sky blazed.

27. Reducing that powerful Asura to ashes in a trice the spear carried out the job without strain and returned to Kumara. Then Kumara told the Naga child Kumuda —“Go home fearlessly. That Asura has been slain along with his army.”

28. On hearing the words of Guha, Kumuda, the son of the Naga chief eulogised and bowed to Kumara and went to Patala in great delight.

29. Thus the story of the victory of Kumara, including the wonderful way in which Taraka was slain, has been narrated by me, noble sage.

30. It is the divine story that removes all sins. It bestows all desires on men. It is conducive to the increase of wealth, glory and longevity. It confers worldly pleasures and salvation on the good.

31. Those who recite this divine story of Kumara and glorify him are infinitely fortunate and attain Sivaloka.

161. Patala an island accessible through the sea route, an abode of the Nigas with Bhogavati as the capital (cf M M K. It is XL of Ceylon 'Patala, G P. 454) It is variously identified with Indo-China and old Annam. See Avasthi, Studies in Sk. P. P- 113 -

162. As &#x26;P states, the victory of Kumara over the Asura Taraka is a factual happening (vfttam), while V. S. Agrawal insists on the symbolic interpretation of the legend. According to him Taraka is the Asuric form in the individual which remains in contact with the matter and is soiled by it. This form is suppressed and sublimated by Kumara who is the symbol of Sakti quickened by Siva.

11. My maternal grandfather, the excellent mountain Himavat, will become the fortunate bestower of fruits to ascetics.

The gods said:

13. Now, it behoves you to go to Kailasa with great pleasure, to the abode of Siva in order to see your mother and father Siva and Parvati.

Brahma said:

14. After saying thus and obtaining his permission, Vishnu and other gods went jubilantly to that mountain along with Kumara.

15. When the lord Kumara started to Kailasa, the abode of Siva, sounds of “Victory” arose indicating great auspiciousness.

49. Siva the great Itena, the kinsman of the distressed, the goal of the good, became delighted and spoke to Visnu and other important gods. Siva said:

Ndrada said:

1. O lord of gods and people, O storehouse of Siva’s cult, the excellent story of Karttikeya, far better than nectar, has been heard by me.
2. Now I wish to hear the excellent story of GaneSa, the details of his divine nativity, auspicious of the auspicious.

Sdta said:

On hearing the words of Narada the great sage, Brahma became delighted and replied to him remembering Siva.

Brahma said:

Due to the difference of Kalpas, the story of the birth of GaneSa is told in different ways. According to one account he is born of the great lord. His head looked at by Sani was cut off and an elephant’s head was put on him.
Now we narrate the story of the birth of GaneSa in Svetakalpa when his head was cut off by the merciful Siva.
No suspicion need be entertained, O sage. Siva is certainly the cause of enjoyment and protection. He is the lord of all. Siva is possessed as well as devoid of attributes.
It is by His divine sport that the entire universe is created, sustained and annihilated. O excellent sage, listen to what is relevant to the context, with attention.
A long time had lapsed after the marriage of Siva and His return to Kailasa that GaneSa was born.
Once the friends Jaya and Vijaya conferred with Parvati and discussed.
All the Ganas of Rudra carry out the orders of

1 63- Sani (the planet Saturn) is called the evil-eyed (Kruradr$) for his glance casts an evil effect. The present context refers to a legend of Parvati who proud of her son, Ganesha, asked Sani to look at him. Sani looked and the child’s head was burnt to ashes. Parvati felt greatly distressed and Brahma offered consolation advising her to replace the head with the first she could find and that was an elephant’s.

164. Svetakalpa, a short form of Svetavftraha Kalpa, is one of the thirty Kalpas. According to the Purapas the legends of one Kalpa are repeated in the other. In this process some modifications in the accounts are bound to happen with the changes in the happenings. The legend of Ganesha as recorded in this chapter belongs to Svetavirihakalpa. It is distinct from the one referred to above.

12. Pramathas are numerous. But none of them can be called our own. They all stand at the portals, subservient to Siva’s behests.

13. They also may be called our own but our mind is not in unison with them. Hence, O sinless lady, one, our own must be created.

Brahma said:

14. Goddess Parvati to whom this charming suggestion was made by the two friends considered it wholesome and resolved to carry it out.

15. Once when Parvati was taking her bath, Sadaliva rebuked Nandin and came into the inner apartment.

16. The mother of the universe, seeing the untimely arrival of Siva in the midst of her bath and toilet stood up. The beautiful lady was very shy then.

17. The goddess decided that her friend’s suggestion would be conducive to her good and was so enthusiastic.

18. At the time when the incident occurred, Parvati, the great Maya, the great goddess, thought as follows.

19. “There must be a servant of my own who will be expert in his duties. He must not stray from my behest even a speck.”

20. Thinking thus the goddess created a person with all the characteristics, out of the dirt from her body.

21. He was spotless and handsome in every part of his body. He was huge in size and had all brilliance, strength and valour.

22-23. She gave him various clothes and ornaments. She blessed him with benediction and said— “You are my son. You are my own. I have none else to call my own.” Thus addressed the person bowed to her and said:

Out of love and mercy she embraced and kissed him. She placed him armed with a staff at her entrance as the gatekeeper.
Then the son of the goddess, of great heroic power, stayed at the doorway armed with a staff with a desire to do what was good to her.
Thus placing her son at the doorway, Parvatl began to take bath with her friends, unworried.
O excellent sage, at this very moment Siva who is eagerly indulgent and an expert in various divine sports came near the door.
Not knowing that he was lord Siva, the consort of Parvatl, GaneSa said— “O sir, without my mother’s permission you shall not go in now.
My mother has entered the bath. Where are you going now? Go away” saying thus, he took up his staff to ward him off.
On seeing him Siva said “O foolish fellow, whom are you forbidding? O wicked knave, don’t you know me? I am Siva, none else”.
Thereupon GaneSa beat Siva with the staff. Siva expert in various sports became infuriated and spoke to his son thus.

Siva said:

You are a fool, You do not know that I am Siva, the husband of Parvati. O boy, I go in my own house. Why do you forbid me?

RudrasarhkitS 769

Brahmd said:

37. When lord Siva tried to enter the house, Gane£a became infuriated, O brahmin, and struck him with his staff once again.

30. Then Siva too became furious. He commanded his own Ganas — “Who is this fellow here? What is he doing? O Ganas, enquire.”

39. After saying this, the furious Siva stood outside the house. The lord, following the worldly conventions, is capable of various wonderful sports.

# CHAPTER FOURTEEN

# (The Ganas argue and wrangle)

Brahmd said:

1. The infuriated Ganas of Siva at his bidding went there and questioned the son of Parvatl who stood at the gate. Siva's Ganas said:

2. “Who are you? Whence do you come? What do you propose to do? If you have a desire to remain alive go away from here.”

Brahmd said:

3. On hearing their words, the son of Parvatl who was armed with the staff spoke to the Ganas as follows:

GaneSa said:

4. O “handsome fellows, who are you? Whence have you come? Go away. Why have you come here and why do you stand in opposition to me?”

Brahmd said:

5. On hearing his words, Siva’s Ganas of great heroism and arrogance laughingly spoke to one another.

6. After conferring with one another, the infuriated Par$adas of Siva replied to Gapeta, the doorkeeper.

# Sivapurdna

# Siva’s Ganas said:

7. “Listen. We are the excellent Ganas of Siva. We are his doorkeepers. We have come here to throw you out at the bidding of lord Siva.

8. Considering you too, as one of the Ganas, we are not going to kill you. Otherwise you would have been killed. Better stay away yourself. Why do you court death?”

# Brahma said:

9. Though warned thus, Gane^a, the son of Parvati, stood fearless. He did not leave his post at the door. He rebuked Siva’s Ganas.

10. After hearing his words, the Ganas of Siva went back and informed Siva about his stand.

11. O sage, on hearing their words, lord Siva of wonderful divine sports, following the worldly conventions rebuked his Ganas.

# Lord Siva said:

12. “Who is this fellow? What does he say? He is standing there haughtily as though he is our enemy. What will that wicked knave do? Certainly he wants to die.

13. Why? Are you dastardly eunuchs to stand here helplessly and complain to me about him? Let this new doorkeeper be thrown out.”

# Brahma said:

14. Thus commanded by lord Siva of wonderful sports the Ganas returned to the place and spoke to the doorkeeper.

# Siva’s Ganas said:

15. O gatekeeper, who are you standing here? Why have you been stationed here? Why don't you care for us? How can you thus remain alive?

16. We are here the duly appointed doorkeepers. What are you saying? A jackal sitting on a lion’s seat wishes for happiness.

17. O fool, you will roar only as long as you do not...

feel the brunt of our attack. Erelong you will fall by feeling the same.

18. Thus taunted by them, Ganeia became furious and took the staff with his hands and struck the Ganas even as they continued to speak harsh words.

19. Then the fearless Ganeia, son of Parvatl rebuked the heroic Ganas of Siva and spoke as follows:

The son of Pdrvati said:

20. “Get away. Get away. Or I shall give you a fore-taste of my fierce valour. You will be the laughing-stock of all.”

21. On hearing these words of Geneva, the Ganas of Siva spoke to one another.

Siva's Ganas said:

22. What shall be done? Where shall we go? Why shall we not act? Bounds of decency are observed by us. He would not have acted thus, otherwise.

Brahma said:

23. Then the Ganas of Siva went to Siva who was standing at the distance of a Krosa from Kailasa and spoke to him.

24. Siva ridiculed them all. The trident-armed great lord of fierce temperament spoke to his Ganas who professed to be heroes.

Siva said:

25. “Hello, Ganas, impotent wretches, you profess to be heroic but are never so. You are unfit to stand before me and speak. If he is only taunted he will speak in similar tone again.

26. Go and beat him. Some one among you may be competent to do so. Why should I speak more? He must be driven away.”

Brahmd said:

27. O great sage, when rebuked thus by lord Siva, the excellent Ganas went back and spoke to him.

Siva's Goyas said:

1. Hello you boy there, listen. Why do you speak so arrogantly? You go away from here. If not, your death is certain.

Brahma said:

On hearing the words of Siva’s servants the son of Parvati became unhappy and thought “What shall I do?”
In the meantime, the goddess heard the noise of this wrangle between the Ganas and the doorkeeper, then looked at her friend and spoke. “Go and see.”
The friend came to the door and saw them for a moment. She understood the whole matter. She was delighted and returned to Parvati.
O sage, coming back she reported the matter to Parvati as it had occurred. The friend said:
O great Goddess, the heroic Ganas of Siva are taunting and rebuking our own Gana who is standing at the door.
How do these Ganas and Siva enter your apartment suddenly without looking to your convenience? This is not good for you.
Even after undergoing the misery of rebuke etc. he, our Gana, has done well in not allowing anyone in.
What is more? They are arguing too. When the argument has started, they cannot come in happily.
Now that they have started the argument let them conquer him and enter victoriously. Not otherwise, my dear friend.
When this man belonging to us is taunted, it amounts to our being taunted. Hence, O gentle lady, you shall not abandon your prestige of high order. O What
Siva always squeezes you like a crab, Sati. will he do now? His pride will take a favourable turn for us.

Brahma said:

Alas, being subservient to Siva’s wish, Parvati stood there for a moment.

# Rudrasartihitd

41. Then taking up a haughty mood she spoke to herself.

Pdrvati said: —

42. “Alas, he did not wait for a moment. Why should he force his way in? What shall be done now? Or shall I adopt a humble attitude.

43. What is to happen happens. What is done cannot be altered?” After saying this, Parvati sent her again lovingly.

44. The friend came to the door and told Gane£a what Parvati had said with affection.

The friend said:

45. O gentle sir, well done. Let them not enter forcibly. What are these Ganas before you? Can they win a person like you?

46. Whether good or bad let your duty be done. If you are conquered there will be no further enmity at all.

Brahma said:

47. On hearing the words of the friend and his mother Gane€vara became highly delighted, strengthened and lifted up-

48. Girting up his loins, tying his turban firmly and clapping his calves and thighs, he spoke fearlessly to all the Gagas.

Gonefa said:

49. I am the son of Parvati. You are the Ganas of Siva. Both of us are thus equal. Let your duty be done, now.

50. You are all doorkeepers. How is it that I am not? You are standing there and I am standing here. This is certain.

51. When it is certain that you are standing here, you must carry out the directions of Siva.

52. O heroes, now I have to carry out the orders of Parvati faithfully. I have decided what is proper.

53. Hence, O Ganas of Siva, you shall listen with at-

# Sivapurdna

You shall not enter the apartment either forcibly or humbly.

Brahma said:

1. The Ganas when decisively told by GaneSa became ashamed. They went to Siva. After bowing to him they stood in front of him.
2. Then they acquainted him with that news of wonderful nature. They joined their palms, stooped their shoulders, eulogised Siva and stood in front of him.
3. On hearing the detailed news mentioned by his Ganas, Siva replied following the worldly conventions. Siva said:

Brahma said:

O excellent sage, O brahmin, after saying thus, Siva an adept in various divine sports became silent observing the ways of the world.

# CHAPTER FIFTEEN

# (Gonefa's battle)

Brahmd said :

1. When Siva told them thus, they came to a decisive resolution. They got ready and went to Siva’s palace.
2. On seeing the excellent Ganas, fully equipped for war, coming, GaneSa spoke thus to them.

Ganeia said:—

Welcome to the leaders of Ganas, carrying out the behests of Siva. I am only one and that too a mere boy carrying out the directions of Parvatl.
Yet let the goddess see the strength of her son. Let Siva see the strength of his Ganas too.
The fight between the parties of Parvatl and Siva is the one between a strong army and a boy. You are all experts in warfare and have fought in many a battle.
I have never fought in a battle before. I am a mere boy. I am going to fight now. Still if you are put to shame, it will be shameful to Siva and Parvatl.
But that will not happen to me. If I am put to shame, the contrary will happen to me. Parvatl and Siva will be put to shame but not I.
O leader of the Ganas, the war shall be fought after realising this. You shall look up to your lord and I to my mother.
What sort of a fight shall be fought? Let what is destined to occur, occur. No one in the three worlds can ward it off.

Brahmd said :

When thus taunted and rebuked they rushed towards him with big batons, decorating their arms and taking up different kinds of weapons.
Gnashing their teeth, grunting and bellowing and calling out “See, See”, the Ganas rushed at him.
Nahdin came first and caught hold of his leg.



---


776 Sivapur&#x26;pa pulled at it. Bhjhgin then rushed at him and caught hold of his other leg.

13. Before the Ganas of Siva had time to pull his legs Gane£a struck a blow at their hands and got his legs free.

14. Then seizing a big iron club and standing at the doorway he smashed the ganas.

15. Some got their hands broken, others got their backs smothered. The heads of others were shattered and the foreheads of some were crushed.

16. The knees of some were fractured, the shoulders of others were blasted. Those who came in front were hit in the chest.

17. Some fell on the ground, some fled in various directions, some got their legs broken and some fled to Siva.

18-19. Now none among them stood face to face. Just as deer flee to any direction on seeing a lion, the Ganas, who were thousands in number fled in that manner. Then Gancsa returned to doorway and stood there.

20. He was seen as the annihilator of all in the manner of Yama, the terrible god of death at the end of a Kalpa.

21. At this time, urged by Narada, all the gods including Vi?nu and Indra came there.

22. Standing in front of Siva and bowing to him with a desire to secure good for him they said — “O lord, be pleased to command us.

23. You are the great Brahman, the lord of all, the creator, the sustainer and the annihilator of all created things. All are your servants.

24. You are intrinsically devoid of attributes but by means of your sports you assume Rajasika, Sattvika and Tamasika forms. O lord, what sort of sport you are indulging in, now?”

Brahmd said:

25. O excellent sage, on hearing their words and seeing the Ganas completely shattered, lord Siva told them everything.

26. O excellent sage, Siva, the lord of all, the consort of Pirvati, then laughingly told me, BrahmS.

# Rudrasarhhita

Sioa said:

27. O Brahma, listen. A boy is standing at the entrance to my house. He is very strong. He has a staff in his hand. He prevents me from entering the house.

28. He strikes very dexterously. He has destroyed many of my Parsadas. He has forcefully defeated my Ganas.

29. O Brahma, you alone should go there. This strong boy shall be propitiated. O Brahma, you shall do everything to bring him under control.

Brahma said:

30. On hearing the words of the lord and unable to know the reality, being deluded by ignorance, O dear, I went near Ganesa accompanied by the sages.

31. On seeing me approaching, the powerful Ganesa came to me very furiously and plucked my moustache and beard. “Forgive me. Forgive me, O lord. I have not come for fighting. I am a brahmin and shall be blessed. I have come to make peace and I will cause no harm.”

32. While I said thus, O brahmin, the heroic Ganesa, the boy of great valour uncommon to the boys took up the iron club.

33. On seeing the powerful Ganesa seizing the iron club I began to run away immediately.

34. The others too who were shouting “Go, Go” were struck down with the iron club. Some fell themselves and some were felled by him.

35. Some of them fled to Siva in a trice and intimated to him the details of the incident.

36. On seeing them in that plight and on hearing the news, Siva, an adept in sports became very angry.

37. He issued directives to Indra and other gods, to the Ganas led by the six-faced Kumara and to goblins, ghosts and spirits.

38. At the bidding of Siva they all desired to kill Ganesa. Lifting up their weapons in a suitable manner they came there from all directions.

39. Whatever weapon they had was hurled on Ganesa with force.



---


41. There was a great hue and cry in all the three worlds consisting of the mobile and immobile. The inhabitants of the worlds were in a great fix and uncertainty.

42. “Brahma’s life span is not over, but the whole universe is undergoing untimely destruction. Certainly it is due to Siva’s wish.

43. The six-faced deity and the other gods who came there failed to use their weapons effectively. They were very much surprised.

44. In the meantime, goddess, the mother of the universe, of special knowledge, came to know of the entire incident and was very furious.

45. O great sage, the goddess created two Saktis1 then and there for the assistance of her own Gana.

46. O great sage, one Sakti assumed a very fierce form and stood there opening her mouth as wide as the cavern of a dark mountain.

47. The other assumed the form of lightning. She wore many arms. She was a huge and terrible goddess ready to punish the wicked.

48. The weapons hurled by the gods and the Ganas were caught in the mouth and hurled back at them.

49. None of the weapons of the gods was seen anywhere around the iron club of Ganeia. This wonderful feat was performed by them.

50. A single boy stirred and churned the vast impassable army in the same manner as great mountain7 churned the ocean of milk formerly.

51. Indra and other gods were struck by him, single-handed. The Ganas of Siva became agitated and distressed then.

52. Gasping frequently for their breath, being utterly

shaken by his blows they gathered together and spoke to one another.

The gods and Ganas said:

53. “What shall be done? Where should we go? The ten directions have become visible - He is whirling the iron club right and left.”

Brahma said:

54-55. In the meantime the excellent nymphs came there with flowers and sandal paste in their hands. You and other gods who were eager to witness the fight came there. O excellent sage, the excellent pathway of the firmament was entirely filled by them.

56. Seeing the battle they were much surprised. Such a battle had never been witnessed by them before.

57. The earth with all the oceans quaked. As a result of the violent battle even mountains fell down.

58. The sky whirled with the planets and the stars. Everything was agitated. The gods fled. The Ganas too did likewise.

59. The valorous six-faced deity alone did not flee. The great warrior stopped everyone and stood in front.

60. But the Ganas fought in vain with the two Saktis. The weapons of the gods and the Ganas were broken and hence withdrawn by them.

61. Those that tarried went to Siva. All the gods and Ganas fled.

62. Those who went in a body to Siva bowed to him again and again and asked Siva immediately “O lord who is that excellent Gana?”

63. We have heard that battles used to be fought formerly. Even now many battles are being fought. But never was such a battle seen or heard.

64. O lord, let this be pondered over a little. Otherwise no victory is possible. O lord, you alone are the saviour of the universe. There is no doubt about it.”

Brahma said:

more furious and went there along with his Ganas.

66. The entire army of the gods along with the discus-bearing Visnu shouted in jubilation and followed Siva.

67. In the meantime, bowing to Siva, the lord of the gods with palms joined in reverence, O Narada, you spoke as follows.

N&#x26;rada said:

68. “O lord of the gods, please listen to my words. You are the all-pervading lord and expert in various sports.

69. By indulging in a great sport, the arrogance of the Ganas has been removed by you. O Sankara, the impudence of the gods too has been removed by giving this (Ganesa) much strength.

70. O lord Siva, your own wonderful strength has been known to the worlds, you who independently remove the haughtiness of everyone.

71. O lord who are favourably disposed to your devotees, do not indulge in that sport. Please honour your own Ganas and the gods suitably and make them flourish.

72. O bestower of the region of Brahman, please do not treat him leisurely but kill him in your play now.” O Narada, after saying this, you vanished from the place.

(The head of Ganesa is chopped off during the battle)

Brahmi said:

2. He called Visnu and consulted him. Then with a great army and the gods, He, the three-eyed lord, stood face to face with him.

3. After remembering the lotuslike feet of Siva, the

gods possessing great strength, kindly glanced at by Siva and highly jubilant, fought with him.

1. Viṣṇu of great strength, valour and skill and possessing great divine weapons and Siva’s form fought with him.
2. Ganesa hit all the chief gods with his staff. He hit Viṣṇu too, all of a sudden. The hero had been conferred great strength by the Saktis.
3. O sage, all the gods including Visnu were hit by him with the stick. They were turned back with their strength sapped.
4. O sage, after fighting for a long time along with the army and seeing him terrific, even Siva was greatly surprised.
5. Thinking within himself “He has to be killed only by deception and not otherwise” he stayed in the midst of the army.
6. When lord Siva who though devoid of attributes had assumed the attributive form was seen in the battle, when Visnu too had come thither, the gods and Ganas of Siva were highly delighted. They joined together and became jubilant.
7. Then Ganesa the heroic son of Sakti following the course of heroes, at first worshipped (i.e struck) Visnu with his staff, Visnu who confers happiness to all.
8. “I shall cause him delusion. Then let him be killed by you, O lord. Without deception he cannot be killed. He is of Tamasika nature and inaccessible.” Thinking thus and consulting Siva, Viṣṇu secured Siva’s permission and was engaged in the activities of delusion.
9. O sage, on seeing Viṣṇu in that manner, the two Saktis handed over their power to Ganesa and became submerged.
10. When the two Saktis became submerged, Ganesa with more strength infused in him hurled the iron club in the place where Visnu stood.
11. Viṣṇu strenuously dodged the same after remembering Siva, the great lord, favourably disposed towards His devotees.
12. Seeing his face on a side, the infuriated Siva took up his trident with a desire to fight and came there.

Siva arrived there with desire to fight him to a finish, the great lord with the trident in his hand.

# 19.

Ganesa, the great hero, who had been rendered more powerful by Parvati and the Saktis remembered the lotuslike feet of his mother and struck him in his hand with his Sakti.

# 20.

Thereupon the trident fell from the hand of Siva of supreme soul. Seeing this, Siva the source of great enjoyment and protection took up his bow Pinaka.

# 21.

Ganesa felled that to the ground by means of his iron club. Five of his hands too were struck. He took up the trident with the other five hands.

# 22.

“Alas, this has been more distressing even to me. What may not happen to the Ganas?” Siva who followed the worldly conventions cried out like this.

# 23.

In the meantime the heroic Ganesa endowed with the surplus power bestowed by the Saktis struck the gods and the Ganas with his iron club.

# 24.

The gods and the Ganas smothered by that wonderful striker with the iron club went away to the ten directions. None of them remained in the battlefield.

# 25-27.

On seeing Ganesa, Visnu said —“He is blessed. He is a great hero of great strength. He is valorous and fond of battle. Many gods, Danavas, Daityas, Yaksas, Gandharvas, and Rak$asas I have seen. In the entire extent of the three worlds, none of them can equal Ganesa in regard to brilliance, form, features, valour and other qualities.”

# 28.

Ganesa, son of the Saktis whirled the iron club and hurled it at Visnu even as he was saying so.

# 29.

After remembering the lotus-like feet of Siva, Visnu took up his discus and split the iron club by means of discus.

# 30.

Ganesa hurled the piece of iron club at Visnu which was caught by the bird Garu^a and rendered futile.

# 31.

Thus for a long time the two heroes Visnu and Ganesa fought with each other.

# 32.

Again the foremost among heroes, the son of Parvati took up his staff of unrivalled power remembering Siva and struck Visnu with it.

# 33.

Struck with that unbearable blow he fell on the ground. But he got up, quickly and fought with Parvati’s son.

34. Securing this opportunity, the Trident-bearing deity came there and cut off his head with his trident.

35. O Narada, when the head of Gane$a was cut off, the armies of the gods and the Ganas stood still.

36. You, Narada, then came and acquainted Parvati with the matter—“O proud woman, listen. You shall not cast off your pride and prestige.”

37. O Narada, saying this, you, fond of quarrels, vanished from there. You are the unchanging sage and a follower of the inclinations of Siva.

# CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

# (The Resuscitation of Gane$a)

jV&#x26;rada said:

1. O Brahma, of great intellect, please narrate. When the entire news was heard what did the great goddess Parvati do? I wish to hear all in fact.

Brahma said:

2. O foremost among sages, listen. I shall mention the story of the mother of the universe in the manner that it happened afterwards.

3. When GaneSa was killed, the Ganas were very jubilant. They played on Mrdangas and Patahas.

4. After cutting off the head of GaneSa even as Siva became sorry, goddess Parvati became furious, O great sage.

5. “O what shall I do? Where shall I go? Alas, great misery has befallen me. How can this misery, this great misery be dispelled now?

6. “My son has been killed by all the gods and the Ganas. I shall destroy them all or create a deluge.”

7. Lamenting thus, the great goddess of all the worlds angrily created in a moment hundreds and thousands of Saktis.

8. Saktis who were thus created, bowed to Parvati,

the mother of the universe and blazing brilliantly spoke “O mother, be pleased to command.”

9. O great sage, on hearing that, Parvatl, the Sakti of Siva, the PrakrtL the great Maya, spoke to them all in great fury.

The goddess said :

10. O Saktis, O goddesses, now a great deluge shall be created by you at my bidding. You need not hesitate in this regard.

11. “O friends, devour forcibly all these sages, gods, Yak$as, Rakjasas belonging to us and others.”

Brahma said :

12. On being commanded by her, the infuriated Saktis got ready to destroy the gods and others.

13. Just as the fire consumes dry grass so also these Saktis attempted to destroy.

14-15. Leaders of Ganas or Visnu, Brahma or Siva, Indra or Kubera, Skanda or the Sun —Saktis began to destroy them. Wherever one looked, Saktis were present.

16. Karalis (the Terrific), Kubjakas (the hump-backed), Khaftjas (the lame), Lamba£ir$as (the tall-headed) the innumerable Saktis took up the gods with their hands and threw them in their own mouths.

17-18. On seeing that Siva, Brahma, Vi$nu, Indra, the other gods, Ganas and the sages began to doubt what the Goddess Parvatl would be doing, whether she would create an untimely dissolution. Their hopes and aspirations for life were quelled. and —“What

19. They all gathered together discussed shall be done now? Let us ponder.” Discussing thus they spoke to one another.

20. “Only when the goddess Parvatl is pleased can there be a relief; not otherwise, even with our maximum efforts.

21. Even Siva who is an expert in different sports and is deluding us all, seems distressed like an ordinary man.

22. When the hips of all the gods are broken and Parvati is fiery in rage, none of them dare stand before her.

23-24. Whether a person belonging to her or to others, whether a god, a demon, a Gana, a guardian of the quarters, a Yak?a, a Kinnara, a Sage, Brahma, Vi?nu or even lord Siva himself, none could stand before Siva.

25. On seeing her dazzling brilliance, burning all round, all of them were frightened and they stayed far away.

26. In the meantime, O sage Narada, you of divine vision came there for the happiness of the gods and Ganas.

27. After bowing to me, Brahma, Visnu and Siva and discussing jointly, he said — “Let us think and act together.”

28. The gods then discussed with you of noble soul “How could our misery be quelled.” They then said.

29. As long as the goddess Parvati does not favour us there will be no happiness. No suspicion need be entertained in this matter.

30. You and other sages went to Parvati in order to appease her anger. They then propitiated her.

31. They bowed to her again and again. They eulogised her with many hymns. They tried to please her with devotion and at the behest of the gods and Ganas spoke thus.

The celestial sages said:

32. O Mother of the universe, obeisance to you. Obeisance to you, O Siva. Obeisance to you. O Cancjika. Obeisance to you, Kalyani.

33. O mother, you alone are the primordial Sakti. You are the eternal cause of creation. You alone are the sustaining power. You alone are the cause of dissolution.

34. O goddess, be pleased. Spread peace. Obeisance be to you. O goddess, the three worlds are agitated by your fury.

Brahma said:

35. The great goddess Parvati thus eulogised by you.

786 Sioapur&#x26;fa and other sages glanced at them furiously. She did not say anything.

# 36.

Then the sages bowed at her lotus like feet and spoke to her in low voice with devotion joining their palms in reverence. The sages said:

# 37.

O goddess, forgive, forgive. The final dissolution seems near at hand. Your lord is standing here. O mother, you see him.

# 38.

What are we, the gods, Visnu, Brahma and others? We are only your subjects. We stand here with palms joined in reverence.

# 39.

O great goddess, our guilts shall be forgiven. We are agitated and distressed. Parvati give us peace.

# 40.

Brahma said: After saying this, the agitated and distressed sages stood in front of her with palms joined in reverence.

# 41.

On hearing their words Parvati was pleased and she replied to the sages with her mind full of compassion. The goddess said:

# 42-43.

If my son regains life there may not be further annihilation. If you can arrange for him an honourable status and position among you as the chief presiding officer, there may be peace in the world. Otherwise you will never be happy.

# 44.

Brahma said: Thus warned, you and other sages returned and intimated to all the gods everything in detail.

# 45.

On hearing that, Indra and other gods joined their palms in reverence and piteously intimated to Siva what had transpired there.

On hearing what the gods said, Siva spoke thus: "It shall be done accordingly so that there may be peace over all the worlds.”

2. They paid homage to it and started towards the north. It was a single-tusked elephant that they met.
3. They took the head and fitted it to the body. After joining the gods bowed to Siva, Vijnu and Brahma and spoke “What has been ordered by you has been carried out by us. Let the task left incomplete be performed now.”
4. Then the Parjadas shone happily. After hearing those words they awaited eagerly what Siva would say.
5. Then Brahma, Vi?nu and other gods spoke after bowing to lord Siva who is free from the ill effects of the attributes. They said —“Since we are born out of your brilliant Energy let that Energy come into it by the recitation of the Vedic mantras.
6. Saying so, they jointly sprinkled the holy water, invoked by the mantras on that body after remembering Siva.
7. Immediately after the contact of the holy water the boy was resuscitated to life and joined with consciousness. As Siva willed, the boy woke up as from a sleep.
8. He was handsome, extremely comely. He had the face of an elephant. He was red-complexioned. He was delighted with face beaming. He was brilliant and had fine features.
9. O great sage, on seeing the son of Parvati resuscitated to life, they all rejoiced and their miseries came to an end.
10. They showed him delightfully to the goddess. On seeing her restored to life, the goddess was greatly delighted.

# CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

# (Ganeia crowned as the chief of Ganas)

Narada said:

1. O lord of subjects, when the son of Parvatl was resuscitated and seen by the goddess, what happened then? Please narrate to me now.

Brahmd said:

2. O great sage, when the son of Parvatl was resuscitated and seen by the goddess, listen to what happened there. I shall narrate the jubilation that ensued.

3. O sage, that son of Parvatl was resuscitated. He was free from distress and perturbation. Then he was crowned by the gods and the leaders of Ganas.

4. On seeing her son, Parvatl was highly delighted. Taking him up with both her hands she embraced him joyously.

5. She then lovingly gave him different clothes and ornaments.

6. He was honoured by the goddess who bestowed all Siddhis on him and touched him with her hand that removes all distress. After worshipping her son, and kissing his face,

7. she granted him boons with affection and said, “You have had great distress since your very birth.

8. You are blessed and contented now. You will receive worship before all the gods. You will be free from distress.

9. Vermillion is visible on your face now. Hence you will be worshipped with vermillion by all men always.

10-12. All achievements certainly accrue to him who performs your worship with flowers, sandal paste, scents, auspicious food offerings, Nirajana rites, betel leaves, charitable gifts, circumambulations and obeisance. All kinds of obstacles will certainly perish.

13. After saying this, she worshipped her good son with various articles, once again.

14. O Brahmin, then with the graceful blessings of

Rudrasaitihita
Parvati, instantly peace reigned upon gods and particularly on the Ganas.

15. In the meantime, Indra and other gods eulogised and propitiated Siva joyously and brought him devoutly near Parvati.

16. After pleasing her they placed the boy in her lap for the happiness of the three worlds.

17. Placing his lotus-like hand on his head, Siva told the gods, “This is another son of mine.”

18-19. Getting up and bowing to Siva, Parvati, Visnu and I, Gane£a stood of Narada and other sages and said —“My arrogance shall be forgiven. Guilt is the characteristic of Man’s nature.”

20. We three Siva, Visnu and I said to the gods simultaneously with pleasure, after granting him excellent boons.

21. “O great gods, just as we three are worshipped in all the three worlds, so also he shall be worshipped by all of you.”

22. We are the offsprings of primordial nature. He is also the same and hence worthy of worship. He is the remover of all obstacles and the bestower of the fruits of all rites.

23. He shall be worshipped first and we shall be worshipped afterwards. If he is not worshipped, we too are not worshipped.

24. If the other deities are worshipped when he is not worshipped, the fruit of that rite will be lost. There is no doubt in this matter.

25-26. After saying this we worshipped him. Siva worshipped Ganesa with various articles of worship. Vi?nu worshipped him afterwards. I, Brahma, and Parvati too worshipped him. He was then worshipped by all the gods and Ganas with great joy.

27. In order to gratify Parvati, Ganesa was proclaimed as the presiding officer by all, Brahma, Visnu, Siva and others.

28. Again, with a joyful mind, several boons were granted by Parvati to him, always favourable to all in the world.

Siva said:

# 29.

“O son of Parvatl, I am pleased, there is no doubt about it. When I am pleased the entire universe is pleased. None will be against the same.

Since, even as a boy you showed great valour as Parvati’s son, you will remain brilliant and happy always.

# 31.

Let your name be the most auspicious in the matter of quelling obstacles. Be the presiding officer of all my Ganas and worthy of worship now.”

of all castes, particularly by women as well as kings aiming and beginning to be prosperous and flourishing.

60. He will certainly derive whatever he desires. Hence you shall always be served by him whoever he is who desires fruits.

BrahmS said:

61-62. When this was mentioned by Siva to Gane£a of great soul, O sage, the gods, the sages and the Ganas, favourites of Siva said “So be it” and worshipped Gane4a according to prescribed rules.

63. All the Ganas, particularly bowed to Ganesa and adored him respectfully with various articles.

64. O great sage, how can I describe even with my four mouths the indescribable delight of Parvatl.

65. The divine drums were sounded. The celestial damsels danced. The Gandharva chiefs sang. Flowers were showered upon him.

66. When Ganesa was installed, the whole universe attained peace and normalcy. There was great jubilation. All miseries ended.

67. O Narada, Parvatl and Siva rejoiced in particular. Good and plentiful auspiciousness was conducive to happiness everywhere.

68-69. The gods and the sages, who had come there, returned at the bidding of Siva praising Parvatl and GaneSa again and again, eulogising Siva and saying “O what a battle!”

70. When Parvatl became free from fury, Siva and Parvatl behaved as before.

71. With a desire for the welfare of the worlds, the great deity relaxing in his own soul and engaged in the activities of the devotees conferred different kinds of happiness.

72. Both Vi$nu and I took leave of Siva and after paying homage to both Parvatl and Siva returned to our abodes. O holy sage Narada, singing the glory of Parvati and Siva and taking leave of them you too returned to your abode.

Rudrasarfihita 793

74. Thus requested by you, I have narrated the glorious story of Parvati and Siva along with that of Ganesa with great reverence.

75. Whoever hears this narrative auspiciously with pure mind shall have everything auspicious and be the abode of auspiciousness.

76. The childless will get a son, the indigent wealth; the seeker of a wife will get a wife and the seeker of issues will get children.

77. The sick will regain health; the miserable will have good fortune. The sonless, impoverished, banished wife will be reunited with her husband.

78-79. The sorrowing will be relieved of sorrow, undoubtedly. The house that contains this story shall certainly be auspicious. He who listens to this narrative at the time of travel or on holy occasions, with a pure mind shall get all desires, thanks to the grace of lord Ganesa.

2. O dear father, lord of gods, what happened thereafter? Please narrate it. The great glory of Parvati and Siva confers great delight.

Brahma said:

# Sivapurana

5. The happiness of the parents knew no bounds. The son too used to sport in joy and love.

6. O great sage, the sons rendered great service to their parents with great devotion.

7. The love and affection of the parents towards the six-faced lord and Ganesa increased to a great extent like the moon in the bright half of the month.

8. O celestial sage, once the loving parents Parvati and Siva held a secret talk and discussion.

9. They thought that the two sons had attained to marriageable age and how best their marriage should be celebrated now.

10. The six-faced lord Karttikeya was their great beloved son. Ganesa too was likewise. Thinking thus they were worried as well as delighted.

11. O sage, coming to know of their parents' opinion, the sons too were eager to get married.

12. “I shall marry, I shall marry” saying thus to each other they always quarrelled with each other.

13. The couple, the rulers of the worlds, on hearing their words, were very much surprised, following the worldly conventions.

14. A wonderful expedient was devised by them after thinking about the course to be followed in the celebration of their marriage.

15. Once they called the sons to them and spoke as follows. Siva and Parvati said:

16. O good sons, we have framed the rules conducive to your happiness. Listen lovingly. We shall tell you the truth.

17. Both of you are good sons and equal in our eyes. There is no difference. Hence a condition that is beneficial to both of you has been made.

18. The auspicious marriage will be celebrated of that boy who comes here first after going round the entire earth.

Brahma said:

19. On hearing their words, the powerful Kumara



---


# Rudrasarhita

started immediately from the fixed point in order to go round the earth.

20. Gane^a of excellent intellect stood there itself after pondering in his mind frequently with his keen intellect.

21. “What shall be done? Where am I to go? I cannot cross the earth. At best it may be possible to go a Krosa. I cannot go beyond it.

22. What avails that happiness which is achieved after going round the earth?” Please listen to what Ganesa did after thinking thus.

23. He performed the ceremonial ablution and returned home. He then spoke to his father and mother. Ganefa said: —

24. For your worship two seats have I placed here. Please be seated, dear parents. Let my desire be fulfilled.

Brahma said: —

25. On hearing his words, Parvati and Siva sat on the seats for receiving worship.

26. They were worshipped by him and circumambulated seven times and bowed too seven times.

27. Joining his palms in reverence and eulogising his parents agitated by love and affection, many times, Ganesa the ocean of intelligence, spoke thus.

Gonefa said: —

28. “O mother, O father, you please listen to my weighty words. My auspicious marriage shall be celebrated quickly.”

Brahma said:

29. On hearing the words of the noble-minded Gane£a, the parents spoke to him, the storehouse of great intellect. Siva and Parvati said:

30. You shall circumambulate the earth with all its forests. Kumara has already gone. You too start and return first.

# Siuapurdna

Brahma said:

31. On hearing the words of his parents, Ganesa spoke immediately and furiously but with some restraint. Ganesa said —

32. O mother, O father, you two are intelligent and embodied virtue. Hence O excellent ones, you may be pleased to hear my virtuous words.

33. The earth has been circumambulated by me frequently, for seven times. Why then, my parents should say thus?

Brahma said:

34. On hearing his words, the sportively inclined parents, following the worldly conventions spoke to him thus:

The parents said:

35. “O son, when was the great earth circumambulated by you, the earth consisting of seven continents extending to the oceans and consisting of vast jungles?

Brahma said:

36. O sage, on hearing the words of Parvati and Siva, Ganesa, the storehouse of great intellect spoke thus.

Ganesa said:

37. By worshipping you, Parvati and Siva, I have intelligently circumambulated the earth extending to the oceans.

38. Is it not the verdict of the Vedas or the Sastras or any other sacred code? Is it true or otherwise?

39. “He who worships his parents and circumambulates them, will certainly derive the fruit and merit of circumambulating the earth.

40. He who leaves his parents at home and goes on a pilgrimage incurs the sin of their murder.

1 68. On the seven continents, see S. M. Ali, Geography of the Pur&#x26;pas, Ch. II.

41. The holy centre of a son consists of the lotus-like feet of his parents. The other holy centres can be reached only after going a long distance.

42. This holy centre is near at hand, easily accessible and a means of virtue. For a son and wife, the auspicious holy centre is in the house itself.

43. These things are mentioned frequently in the Sastras and the Vedas. Now, are they going to be falsified by you?

44. If so, your very forms will come false. Even the Vedas will become false. There is no doubt about it.

45. Let my auspicious marriage be celebrated and that too very quickly. Otherwise let the Vedas and Sastras be declared false.

46. Of the two alternatives whatever is excellent shall be followed, O parents, embodied virtues!

Brahma said: —

47. Saying thus, Ganesha of excellent intellect, of great wisdom and foremost among intelligent persons assumed silence.

48. On hearing his words, Parvati and Shiva, the rulers of the universe, were very much surprised.

49. Then, Shiva and Parvati praised their son who was clever and intelligent and spoke to him who had spoken the truth.

Shiva and Parvati said: —

50. O son, you are a supreme soul and your thoughts are pure. What you have said is true and not otherwise.

51. When misfortune comes, if a person is keenly intelligent, his misfortunes perish even as darkness perishes when the sun rises.

52. He who has intelligence possesses strength as well. How can he who is devoid of intellect have strength? The proud lion was drowned in a well with a trick by a little hare.

53. Whatever has been mentioned in the Vedas, Sastras and Puranas for a boy, all that has been performed by you, namely, the observance of virtue.

169. This verse introduces the story of the lion and the hare in the Panchatantra.

# 54.

What has been executed by you shall be done by anyone. We have honoured it. It will not be altered now. Brahma said:

# 55.

After saying this and appeasing Ganesa, the ocean of intelligence, they resolved to perform his marriage.

# CHAPTER TWENTY

# (The celebration of GaneSa's marriage)

Brahma said:

# 1.

In the meantime Prajapati Vrtvarupa became delighted and happy on knowing their intention.

# 2.

Prajapati Viivarupa had two daughters of divine features. They were famous as Siddhi and Buddhi. 170 They were exquisite in every part of their body.

# 3.

The lord Siva and Parvati, jubilantly celebrated the marriage of GaneSa with them.

# 4.

The delighted gods attended their marriage as desired by Siva and Parvati.

# 5.

ViSvakarman made all arrangements for the marriage. The sages and the gods were full of great joy.

# 6.

The happiness that GaneSa derived by virtue of this marriage, O sage, cannot be adequately described.

# 7.

After some time, the noble Gancia begot two sons, one each of his wives. They were endowed with divine features.

# 8.

The son K$ema was born to Siddhi. The highly brilliant son Labha was born to Buddhi.

# 9.

While Ganesa was enjoying the inconceivable happiness, the second son returned after circumambulating the earth.

# 10.

Thereupon he was addressed by Narada, the great soul. “I am speaking the truth, no lies. I am not actuated by deception or rivalry.

# 11.

What has been done by Siva and Parvati your

parents, no other person in the world will ever do. Truth. It is the truth I am speaking.

12. After driving you out under the pretext of circumambulating the earth, they have celebrated the excellent and auspicious marriage of Gancsa.

13. By this marriage that was celebrated, Gane'a has obtained two wives joyously. They are the excellent daughters of Prajapati Visvarupa.

14. He has begot of his two wives of auspicious body two sons, Ksema of Siddhi and Labha of Buddhi. They bestow happiness on everyone.

15. Begetting two sons of auspicious futures of his wives Ganesa is continuously enjoying happiness as conceived by your parents.

16. The entire earth consisting of oceans and jungles has been traversed by you due to their deceptive behest. O dear, this is the result of that.

17. O dear, consider. If parents begin to deceive or particularly if our masters begin to deceive, won’t others also begin to deceive.

18. Your parents have not done well. Just ponder over it. I don’t think their action has been good.

19. If mother were to poison her son, if father were to sell his son, if the king were to confiscate the assets of his subjects what can be said and to whom?

20. O dear, an intelligent peace-loving person shall never look at the face of the person who has committed this harmful deed.

21. This policy has been mentioned in the Vedas, Smrtis and sacred texts. It has been intimated to you now. Do as you wish.

Brahma said:

22. O Narada, following the mental process of lord Siva; you spoke these words to Kumara and then kept quiet. After bowing to his father, the infuriated Skanda went to the Kraufica mountain 171 though forbidden by his parents.

171. The famous hill represents part of the Kailasa on which the Manasarovara is situated. See Note 78 P. 629.

24. “Even when forbidden by us why do you go?” Although he was prevented by saying this, he went away saying “No”.

25. “O parents, I shall not stay here even a moment when deception has been practised on me eschewing affection towards me.”

26. O sage, he went away saying so. Even today he is staying there removing the sin of all by his very vision.

27. Ever since that day, O celestial sage, the son of Siva, Karttikeya remains a bachelor.

28. His name bestows auspiciousness in the world. It is famous in the three worlds. It dispels all sins, is meritorious and confers the sanctity of celibacy.

29. In the month of Karttika, the gods, the holy sages and great ascetics go there to see Kumara.

30. He who has the vision of the lord in the Krttika Naksatra in the month of Karttika is divested of all sins. He derives all desired fruits.

31. Parvati became grief-stricken by separation from Skanda. She piteously told her lord, “O lord, let us go there.”

32. Siva went to that mountain partially for her happiness. He assumed the pleasing form of Jyotirlinga named Mallikarjuna.

33. Even now Siva is seen there with Parvati satisfying the desires of his devotees. He is the goal of the good.

34. On coming to know that Siva had come there with Parvati, Kumara became unattached and was eager to go elsewhere.

35. On being requested by the gods and sages he stayed in a place three Yojanas away.

36. O Narada, on the full and new moon days, Parvati and Siva are excited by love towards their son and they go there to see him.

37. On new moon days, Siva himself goes there. On full moon days, Parvati goes there certainly.

172. According to the present context the Mallikirjuna Jyotirlinga was established on the Kraufica mountain. It is difficult to know how it came to be identified with the one on Srilaila overhanging the river in the tputh.

38. O great sage, whatever you had asked in regard to Karttikeya and Ganesa has been narrated by me.

39. On hearing this, an intelligent man becomes free from all sins. He achieves all desired fruits of auspicious nature.

40. Whoever reads, teaches, listens or narrates this story derives all desires. No doubt need be entertained in this respect.

41. A brahmin derives brahminical splendour, a K?atriya becomes victorious, a VaiSya prosperous and a Sudra attains equality with the good.

42. A sick man becomes free from sickness; a frightened man becomes free from fear; no man is harassed by the visitation of goblins, ghosts etc.

43. This narrative is sinless, conducive to glory and enhancer of happiness. It is conducive to longevity and attainment of heaven. It is unequalled and bestows sons and grandsons.

44. It confers salvation and reveals Siva’s principles. It is pleasing to Parvatl and Siva and increases devotion to Siva.

45. This shall always be heard by devotees and by those who seek liberation and are free from worldly desires. It confers identity with Siva. It is conducive to welfare and is identical with Siva himself.

Description of the Tripuras

N&#x26;rada said:

1. The excellent story of the householder Siva, including that of GaneSa, Skanda and others which confers bliss has been heard by us.
2. Now please narrate lovingly the story of how Siva killed wicked persons playfully.
3. How did the lord burn off three cities of the Asuras with a single arrow simultaneously? What sort of an arrow was it?
4. Please narrate the story of the moon-crested lord conducive to the happiness of the gods and sages and a play of the magic of Siva.

Brahma said:

When he was asked by Vyasa formerly, the excellent...

According to the present version, three Asuras T&#x26;iaka, Vidyunm&#x26;Ii and Kamaljksa performed penances and obtained a boon from Brahmfi to build three castles, the one of copper on earth, another of silver in the sky and the third of gold. Brahmfl asked the Asura Maya to build these castles for the Asuras which were destroyed by &#x26;va later on. According to another Version, the Asura Baga received in gift three cities from Siva, Brahma and Vi?nu.

The Chedis adopted the name Tripurl for their capital on the banks of the Narmada. It is now traceable in the insignificant village Tewar, thirteen miles from Jabalpur.

The legend of the three cities is as old as the Brahmana literature. It is said that the Asuras built the city of copper on the earth, of silver in the sky and of gold in the heavenly region.

sage Sanatkumara narrated the story. I will repeat the same.

Sanatkumara said —

# 6.

O Vyasa of great intellect, listen to the story of the moon-crested lord, how the annihilator of the universe burnt the three cities with a single arrow.

# 7.

O great sage, when the Asura Taraka was killed by Skanda, the son of Siva, his three sons performed austerities.

# 8.

The eldest of them was Tarakaksa, the middle one Vidyunmali and the youngest Kamalaksa. All of them were of equal strength.

# 9.

They were self-controlled, well prepared, disciplined, truthful, of steady mind, heroic and inimical to the gods.

# 10.

Eschewing all enjoyments captivating the mind, they went to the cavern of the mountain Meru and performed a wonderful penance.

# 11.

The three sons of Taraka eschewed all desires in the season of spring. They disdained music, the sound of instruments as well as jubilation and performed penances.

# 12.

In the summer season they mastered sunshine. They lighted fires in all directions. Standing in their midst they performed sacrifice with great devotion for the attainment of success.

# 13.

They lay unconscious in the blazing sunshine. During the rainy season, they fearlessly bore all the showers on their heads.

# 14-15.

In the autumn they controlled their hunger and thirst. All good foodstuffs, steady, wholesome, and viscid, fruits, roots and beverages they distributed among the hungry. They themselves remained like stones.

# 16.

In the early winter they remained on top of the mountain with fortitude, unsupported in any of the four quarters.

# 17.

In the late winter they stayed under water or wore wet dripping silken cloth or allowed themselves to be covered with dew drops.

# Sivapurana

18. They were not at all vexed or distressed thereby. They gradually increased the severity of their austerities. Thus the three excellent sons of Taraka performed penance with Brahma as the object of their worship.

19. Maintaining strict severity in their austerities, the excellent Asuras made their bodies emaciated by their penance.

20. Standing on the bare ground on a single foot, the strong Asuras performed the penance for a hundred years.

21. Taking in only air and enduring excessive heat and distress, the terrible and wicked souls continued the penance for a thousand years.

22. They remained standing on their heads for a thousand years. They remained standing with their arms lifted for hundred years.

23. Thus they bore extreme distress in their tenacious evil intent. They remained alert day and night.

24. Sage, thus many years elapsed even as they performed the penance. I think they had a virtuous dedication of their souls in Brahma, these sons of Taraka.

25. Satisfied by their penance, Brahma the supreme lord of the gods and Asuras, of great glory, appeared in front of them in order to grant them boons.

26. He was accompanied by sages, gods and Asuras. The grandfather of all living beings spoke to them thus, appeasing them.

Brahma said:

27. O great Asuras, I am now pleased with your penance. I shall grant you everything. Speak out the boons you wish to have.

28. O enemies of the gods, tell me why you have been performing this penance. I am the bestower of the fruits of all sorts of penance. I am the creator of everything for ever.

Sanatkumdra said:

29. On hearing his words they bowed to the grandfather, with their palms joined in reverence and spoke to him revealing their mind's desire slowly.

Rudrasarhita
The Asuras said:

1. O lord of gods, if you are pleased, if boons are to be given to us, please grant us indestructibility at the hands of everyone, every living being.
2. O lord of the universe, make us steady. Protect us from enemies. Let not old age, sickness and death befall us at any time.
3. We wish to become free from old age and death. In the three worlds we shall subject all others to death.
4. Of what avail are riches, vast earth, excellent cities, other sorts of vast enjoyments or big positions and power?
5. If one is to be swallowed by death in five days, Brahma, everything else belonging to him is futile. This is our decisive thought.

Sanatkumara said:

On hearing the words of those ascetic Asuras, Brahma replied to them after remembering Siva, his lord. Brahma said:
O Asuras, there cannot be invariable indestructibility. Please desist from asking for it. Seek some other boon whatever you wish.
O Asuras, a creature is born, dies and will be born surely. But no one will be free from old age or death in this world.
Except Siva the destroyer of Death, and Visnu all else are mortals. These two are the supervisees of virtue and evil and have manifest and unmanifest forms.
If penance is performed for the harassment of the world, it shall be understood as gone. It is only a well-performed penance that can be fruitful.
Ponder over this keenly, O faultless ones, desist from seeking immortality. Immortality is impossible for the gods and the Asuras. It is inaccessible. It cannot be warded off.
Hence choose a boon whereby you shall do something equal to your own strength.

On hearing the words of Brahma, they thought for a while and then replied to the grandfather of all the worlds.

# 43.

The Asuras said: — O lord, we have no mansion where we can stay happily although we are valorous and invincible to our enemies.

# 44.

Build and give us three wonderful cities richly endowed with wealth and unassailable even to the gods.

# 45.

Tarakaksa then said “Let a city which cannot be broken even by the gods. Let that golden city be mine”.

# 47.

Kamalaksa requested for a great silver city. The delighted Vidyunmali requested for a steel-set magnetic city.

# 48-50.

We will join together during midday at the time of Abhijit when the moon shall be in the constellation Pu$ya, when the dark clouds Puskara and Avar ta shower in plenty without being visible in the firmament with sporting clouds, at the end of a thousand years. These cities shall never join otherwise.

# 51-53.

O Brahma, when these cities are joined together, the lord who embodies all the gods sitting in a wonderful chariot containing all necessary adjuncts, may, in his distorted sport, discharge a wonderful single arrow and pierce our cities. Lord Siva is free from enmity with us. He is worthy of our worship and respect. How can he burn us? This is what we think in our minds. A person like him is difficult to get in the world.

and creator of the worlds remembered Siva and told them “Let it be so.”

# 55.

He ordered Maya177 Maya, build three cities, one of gold, another of silver and a third one of steel.

# 56.

After ordering directly like this, Brahma returned to his abode in heaven even as the sons of Taraka were watching.

# 57-58.

Then the intelligent Maya built the cities by means of his penance: the golden one for Tarakaksa, the silver one for Kamalaksa and the steel one for Vidyunmall. The three fortlike excellent cities were in order in heaven, sky and on the earth.

# 59.

After building the three cities for the Asuras, Maya established them there desiring their welfare.

# 60.

Entering the three cities thus, the sons of Taraka, of great strength and valour experienced all enjoyments.

# 61.

They had many Kalpa trees178 there. Elephants and horses were in plenty. There were many palaces set with gems.

# 62.

Aerial chariots shining like the solar sphere, set with Padmaraga stones, moving in all directions looking like moonshine illuminated the cities.

# 63-64.

There were many palaces, divine minarets resembling the summits of the mount Kailasa. Celestial damsels, Gandharvas, Siddhas, and Caranas were also there. There were temples of Rudra. In every house, people performed the rites of Agnihotra. There were excellent brahmins well-versed in sacred texts and devoted to Siva always.

# 65-66.

The cities were embellished with many trees in the well-laid out gardens and parks as if they had dropped from heaven. There were beautiful tanks, lakes, wells, rivers and huge ponds. They were very beautiful with plenty of fruit-bearing trees.

# 67.

The cities were decorated with camps and tents of various sizes and chariots with beautiful horses. There were herds of elephants in rut too.

# 68.

There were time-indicators, playgrounds and different halls for Vedic studies.

69. There were persons of various types—sinners, virtuous, pious, noble and those of good conduct too.

70. The place was sanctified everywhere by chaste ladies engaged in serving their husbands and averse to evil practices.

71. The cities contained heroic Asuras of great fortune accompanied by their wives, sons and brahmins well versed in the principles and practices of the Vedic and Smarta rites. They were strict adherents to their duties.

72. People had broad chests and bull-like shoulders. Some were of peaceful nature and some of warlike temperament. Some were calm and some furious. Some were hunch-backed. Some were dwarfish.

73. They were protected by Maya. Some had the blue-lily petals. Their hair was curly and dark in hue. Maya had instructed them in the arts of warfare.

74. The cities abounded in people engaged in terrific battles. There were many Asuras whose heroism was sanctified by the worship of Brahma and Siva. The Asuras resembled the sun, the Maruts and Mahendra. They were sturdy.

75. Whatever sacred rites are mentioned in Sastras, Vedas and Puranas, as favourites of Siva, as also the deities, favourites of Siva, were found there.

76. Thus the Asuras, sons of Taraka, after acquiring the boons, lived there subservient to Maya, a great devotee of Siva.

77. Abandoning the other parts in the three worlds they entered the cities and ruled the kingdom following the principles of Siva.

78. O sage, a long time elapsed even as they were engaged in meritorious activities and living happily ruling over the good kingdom.

# CHAPTER TWO

# (The Prayer of the gods)

Vydsa said :

1. O son of Brahma, of great intellect, and most eloquent, please narrate. What happened after that? How did the gods become happy?

Brahma said :

On hearing the words of Vyasa of immeasurable intellect, Sanatkumara spoke after remembering the lotus-like feet of Siva.

Sanatkumara said :

Indra and other gods scorched by their brilliance and distressed consulted one another and sought refuge in Brahma.
After bowing to and circumambulating Brahma, they narrated their grievances to him after awaiting the proper opportunity.

The gods said :

O Brahma, the heaven-dwellers have been subjected to great distress by Maya the virtual ruler of the three cities, accompanied by the sons of Taraka.
Hence, O Brahma, we are distressed and we seek refuge in you. Please plan out the way of their annihilation whereby we can be happy.

Sanatkumara said :

Requested thus by the gods, Brahma, the creator of the worlds laughed and replied to them all who were utterly frightened of Maya.

Brahma said :

O gods, I tell you, do not be afraid at all of those Asuras. Siva will hit upon a good way of killing them.

Sanatkumara said:

# 56-57.

Eulogising thus the bull-bannered, the trident-bearing lord Siva with various kinds of divine hymns, the gods replied thus relevant to the context. O sage, all of them including Indra and others were very much distressed. They were very shrewd in managing their selfish interests and so mentioned them to Siva with stooping shoulders and palms joined in reverence.

The gods said:

# 58.

O lord Siva, the gods including Indra have been defeated by the Asura accompanied by his brothers. O lord, all the gods have been defeated by the sons of Taraka.

# 59.

The three worlds have been brought under their sway. The excellent sages and the Siddhas have been destroyed. The entire universe has been exterminated by them.

# 60.

The terrible Asuras take the entire share of the sacrificial benefits to themselves. They have initiated evil activities. They have prevented the sages from performing their virtuous rites.

# 61.

Definitely the sons of Taraka cannot be killed by any living being. Hence, O Siva, they perform everything as they please.

62. Let some policy be laid down for the protection of the universe lest the terrible Asuras, the denizens of the three cities, should destroy the world.

Sanatkumara said:

63. On hearing these words of Indra and other heaven-dwellers who were expatiating on their distress, Siva spoke in return.

# CHAPTER THREE

# (The virtues of the Tripuras)

Siva said:

1. A meritorious person is the presiding ruler of the Tripuras now. He who practises meritorious deeds should not be killed by sensible persons.

2. O gods, I know the misery of the gods completely. It is great. Those Asuras are very strong. They cannot be killed by the gods or demons.

3. The sons of Taraka and Maya are equally meritorious. O sensible ones, they are invincible to all the citizens.

4. How can I knowingly commit malicious deeds to my friends though I am hardy and powerful in battles? Even Brahma has said that there is a great sin attending on even casual malicious actions.

5. There are ways of atonement and amends for a brahmin slayer, a wine addict, a thief or a person who violates sacred rites. But there is no expiation for ungrateful men. Those Asuras are my devotees. O Gods, how can they be slain by us?

6. Let this aspect be thought over by you who know what is virtue. You must consider this virtuously.

7. They should not be slain as long as they continue their devotion to me. Yet, this reason may very well be intimated to Vishnu.

# SivapurSna

Sanatkumdra said:

8. O sage, thus when they heard these words Indra and other gods immediately intimated this to Brahma in the first instance.

9. Then, with Brahma at their head, the gods including Indra quickly went to Vaikuntha in all glory.

10. On going there and seeing Vi$nu, the gods bowed to him in agitation, and with their palms joined in reverence they eulogised him with great devotion.

11. They intimated to Visnu the powerful, the reasons for their misery, the earlier ones as well as the later.

12. On hearing the distress of the gods as well as the vows observed by the Tripuras, Vi$nu spoke as follows.

Vifnu said:

13. This is true that where the eternal virtue reigns supreme, no misery raises its head like darkness when the sun is seen.

Sanatkumdra said:

14. Oh hearing these words the gods became miserable and dejected. They spoke to Visnu with their lotus-like faces depressed.

The gods said:

15. How are we to go about our activities. How can our misery be dispelled? How can we be happy? How are we to remain firm?

16. As long as the Tripuras are alive, how can we observe virtuous activities? All the residents of the three cities give troubles to us.

17. What else can we say to you? Either the annihilation of the Tripuras shall be made or the untimely destruction of the gods shall be proceeded with.

Sanatkumdra said:

18. After saying this and lamenting frequently, the gods were in a fix and could neither stay nor leave the proximity of Vi?nu. On seeing them that plight, distressed and

humiliated, Visnu thought within himself, “I am the bene-factor of the gods. But what can I do in this affair? The sons of Taraka are the devotees of Siva.” After thinking like this, he thought upon the Supreme Visnu, the lord of sacrifices, the primordial Purusa.

22. Immediately on being thought upon by Vi$nu all the sacrifices came where Visnu was stationed.

23. With palms joined in reverence they bowed to and eulogised Visnu, the lord of sacrifices and the primordial Purusa.

24. The eternal lord Visnu saw the eternal sacrifices and told them looking at the gods too including Indra. Vifnu said:

25. In order to destroy the three cities and to bring about prosperity in the three worlds, O gods perform the worship of lord Siva along with the lord of sacrifices.

Sanatkumdra said:

26. On hearing the words of Vi$nu, the intelligent lord of the gods and bowing to him lovingly, the gods eulogised the lord of sacrifices.

27. O sage, eulogising thus, the gods worshipped the Sacrificial Being in accordance with the rules governing the same with the complete rites.

28. Then from the sacrificial pit rose up thousands of Bhutas of huge size and armed with tridents, spears, iron clubs and other weapons.

29-31. The gods saw thousands of Bhutasanghas armed with tridents and spears and possessing various weapons such as staffs, bows, stones, etc. They had various missiles to strike with. They were in different guises. They resembled the destructive fire and Rudra. They were on a par with the destructive Sun. When they bowed to him and stood waiting in front, Visnu saw them. The glorious lord of sacrifices who carried out the behests of Rudra, spoke to them.

32. Vijnu said— “O Bhutas, listen to my statement.

# 33.

Go there, strike at, break and burn the three cities of the Asuras. O Bhutas, thereafter you can go away as you please for prosperity.

# 34.

Sanatkumdra said: On hearing the words of the lord, the hosts of Bhutas bowed to the lord of the gods and went to the three cities of the Asuras.

# 35.

Immediately after their entry into the cities they were reduced to ashes like moths in the fire.

# 36.

Those who escaped fled out of the cities and came grief-stricken to Visnu.

# 37.

On seeing them and hearing the incidents in detail, lord Vi$nu pondered over this.

# 38.

On realising that all the gods were distressed and dejected in the mind, he too was extremely grieved.

# 39.

He became much worried at the thought “How can I destroy the three cities of the Asuras, with force and carry out the task of the gods?”

# 40.

The lord who had authoritatively laid down the rules of conduct according to the Vedas, said “There is no doubt in this that the virtuous ones cannot be destroyed by black magic.

# 41.

O good gods, these Asuras and the other residents of the three cities are virtuous. Hence they have become invincible. Not in any other manner.

# 42.

After perpetrating great sins they worship Siva and so they are freed of all sins even as the leaves of the lotus from water.

# 43.

O gods, thanks to the worship of Siva, their cherished desires are realised. Different means of enjoyment in the world are brought under their control.

# 44.

Hence these Asuras who are devoted to the phallic worship enjoy different kinds of pleasures and prosperity and salvation hereafter.

# 45.

Then putting obstacles in their activities of virtuous rites, by means of magic art I shall destroy the three cities.

of the Asuras quickly for accomplishing the task of the Asuras.

46. After thinking thus, lord Viṣṇu set himself to the task of interfering with the sacred rites of the Asuras.

47. As long as the worship of Siva is continued and as long as the pure activities are strictly adhered to, there is no question of their ruin at all.

48. Hence such means shall be followed as will make Vedic Dharma disappear thence. Undoubtedly the Asuras will forsake their worship of the phallic emblem of Siva.

49. Deciding thus, Viṣṇu started ridiculing the Vedas for putting up obstacles in the virtuous activities of the Asuras.

50. At the bidding of Siva, Viṣṇu who was commanded to protect the three worlds, and who renders help to the gods spoke to them.

Viṣṇu said: O gods, you go your own abodes. Undoubtedly

51. I shall carry on the task of the gods to the extent of my intellect.

52. Strenuously I shall make them averse to Siva. Coming to know that they are devoid of devotion to him he will reduce them to ashes.

Sanatkumāra said: —

53. O sage, accepting his behest with bent head, the gods and Brahma felt satisfied and with faith in their hearts returned to their abodes.

54. Thereafter Viṣṇu performed deeds conducive to the welfare of the gods. Listen to those excellent deeds destructive of all sins.

# CHAPTER FOUR

# (The Tripuras are initiated)

Sanatkumdra said :

1. For causing obstacles in their virtuous activities, Vi?nu of great brilliance, created a Purusa184 born of himself.
2. He had a shaven head, wore dirty clothes, held a woven wicker vessel in his hand and a roll of cotton in his hand which he shook at every step.
3. His hands tucking at the cloth were weak. His face was pale and weak. In a faltering voice he was muttering “Dharma, Dharma.”
4. He bowed to Vi$nu and stood in front of him. He spoke to Visnu with hands joined in reverence.
5. “O laudable, revered one, please tell me what my names are and what my place shall be.”
6. On hearing these auspicious words, Lord Vi?n u became delighted and spoke these words.

Vifltu said :

O intelligent one, born of me, you are certainly identical with me in form. Know why you have been created. I shall tell you.
You are born of me. You can perform my task. You are my own. Certainly you will be worthy of worship always.
Let your name be Arihat. You will have other auspicious names too. I shall assign to you a place after-

184. According to the present context Vi spu created a delusive teacher called M&#x26;ySmoha who created a Mayasastra of sixteen lakhs of ilokas in Apabhramsa, preaching Jina Dharma for misguiding the Asuras. Mftyamoha created four sorts of preachers for the propagation of Jina Dharma. He preached non-violence, forbade arauta and Sm&#x26;rta rituals, discarded VarpMraraa system, created an order for women that resulted in leaving their home and leading the life of nuns. In some versions, the role is assigned to Brhaipati, the preceptor of the Gods who in the guise of their preceptor &#x26;ukra deludes the Asuras. For details, see MaySmohaprakarapa in Padma, Vispu, LiAga, Matsya etc.

wards. Now hear with reverence what is relevant to the context.

10-11. O you who wield Maya, create a deceptive sacred text of sixteen hundred thousand verses, contrary to Srutis and Smrtis wherein Varnas and Asramas shall be eschewed. Let that holy text be in Apabhramsa language. Let there be emphasis on actions. You shall strain yourself to extend it further.

12. I shall bestow on you the ability to create it. Different kinds of magic arts shall be subservient to you.

13. On hearing the words of Visnu, the great soul, the Maya Purusa bowed to and replied to Visnu. The shaven-head said:

14. O lord, command me quickly what I shall do. At your bidding, all activities shall be fruitful.

Sanatkumdra said:

15. Saying this he recited the main tenet in the deceptive philosophy. “Heaven and hell are functioning here itself.”

16. Remembering the lotus-like feet of Siva, Visnu told him again. “These Asuras, the residents of the three cities, shall be deluded.

17. O intelligent one, they shall be initiated by you. They shall be taught strenuously. At my bidding you will incur no sin on that account.

18. O ascetic, no doubt, Vedic and Smarta rites flourish and shine there. But these shall certainly be exploded through this Vidya.

19. O you with shaven head, you shall go there for destroying the residents of the three cities. Revealing the Tamasika rites, destroy the three cities.

20. After that, O great one, you shall go to the desert.

21. When the Kali age begins let your Dharma be revealed. You shall then continue to do so by means of disciples and disciples’ disciples.

22. At my bidding your cult shall certainly expand. Depending upon my permission and direction you will attain me as your goal.

23. At the bidding of the lord Siva transmitted through the thought process, Visnu, the powerful, commanded him thus and vanished.

24. Then the ascetic of shaven head acting in accordance with Vi?nu's behest created four disciples of the like form as himself and taught them the deceptive cult.

25. The four disciples had shaven heads and were of auspicious features. They bowed to Visnu, the great soul and stood waiting.

26. O sage, the delighted Visnu too, who carries out the behests of Siva spoke to those four disciples.

27. “Just as your preceptor you too will become blessed at my bidding. There is no doubt in this that you will attain good goal.

28. The four disciples with shaven heads followed the heretic cult. They had the wicker vessel in their hands. They covered their mouths with a piece of cloth.

29. They habitually wore dirty clothes. They did not talk much. Delightedly they used to speak “Dharma is the great gain, the true essence” and some similar words.

30. They held a besom broom made of pieces of cloths. They used to walk step by step very slowly because they were afraid of injuring living beings.

31. O sage, with great joy they bowed to the lord and stood in front of him.

32. They were grasped by the hand by Vi?nu and formally entrusted to the preceptor. Their names too were announced by him particularly and lovingly.

33. “Just as you, these too also belong to me. The initial prefix to their names shall be the word “Pujya” because they are worthy of respect.

34. Let the names R$i, Yati, Acarya, and Upadhyaya also be well known appendages to you all.

35. My names shall also be assumed by you. The auspicious name “Arihat” shall be considered destructive of sins.

36. All activities conducive to the happiness of the worlds shall be performed by you. The goal of those who carry on activities favourable to the worlds shall become excellent.*

Sanatkumdra said:

37. Then, bowing to Vi$nu who carried out the wishes of Siva, the deceptive sage went joyously to the three cities accompanied by his disciples.

38. Urged by Visnu of great magic, that sage of great self-control entered the three cities and created illusion.

39. Stationing himself in a garden at the outskirts of the city, accompanied by his disciples he set his magic in motion. That was powerful enough to fascinate even the expert magicians.

40. O sage, his magic was ineffective in the three cities by virtue of Siva’s worship. Then the heretic sage became distressed.

41. He mentally remembered and eulogised Vi$nu many times, with an aching heart. He had been so dispirited and listless.

42. On being remembered by him Vi$nu mentally thought of Siva. Receiving his behest by the process of thought forms he remembered Narada.

43. Immediately after, Narada approached Vi$nu. After bowing to him and eulogising him, he stood before Vi$nu with palms joined in reverence.

44. Visnu, the foremost among the intelligent and who always carried out the tasks of the gods and who was engaged in rendering help to the worlds spoke to Narada then.

45. “O dear, this is being mentioned to you at the bidding of £iva. Go to the three cities immediately. The

sage has gone there already for deluding the residents of the cities.

Sanatkumara said:

1. On hearing his words, Narada, the excellent sage went there quickly where the ascetic expert in magic was stationed.
2. Narada, an expert in magic, at the bidding of the lord, an expert in the art of illusion, entered the three cities along with the deceptive sage, and got himself initiated.
3. Then Narada approached the lord of the three cities. After the preliminary enquiries about his health and welfare he spoke to the king.

Narada said:

A certain sage, very virtuous and excellent master of lores has arrived here. He possesses complete knowledge of the Vedic lore.
Many cults have been observed by me but none of them is like his. Seeing the eternal virtue in this cult we have got ourselves initiated into it.
O great king, O excellent Asuras, if you have any interest in that cult, you shall get yourself initiated into it.

Sanatkumara said:

On hearing his words full of significance, the lord of the Asuras was deluded and exclaimed with surprise in his heart.
“Since Narada has been initiated we too shall be initiated.” Resolving thus, the Asura approached the sage.
On seeing his features, the Asura was deluded by his magic. After bowing to him he spoke thus.

The Tripura ruler said:

O sage of pure mind, you shall perform my initiation. I shall become your disciple. True. It is undoubtedly true.
On hearing the frank words of the ruler of the

# Rudrasarhita

Asuras the heretic sage, professing to be eternal, spoke emphatically.

57. O excellent Asura, if you are prepared to act according to my behests, I shall initiate you, otherwise not, even if you strive for a number of times.

58. On hearing these words the king was deluded by magic. With palms joined in reverence he immediately replied to the sage.

The Asura said:

59. I shall carry out whatever command you are pleased to give. I will not transgress your orders. True. It is certainly true.

Sanatkumdra said:

60. On hearing the words of the Tripura-ruler, the excellent sage removed the cloth from his mouth and said.

61. “O lord of Asuras, take initiation in this most excellent of all cults. By this initiation you will become contented.”

Sanatkumdra said:

62. Saying thus, the deceptive sage immediately performed the initiation of the ruler of the Asuras, in accordance with his cult observing all rules.

63. O sage, when the ruler of the Asuras was initiated along with his brothers, the residents of the three cities too got themselves initiated.

64. O sage, the entire Tripuras were filled with the line of disciples of the sage, an expert in great art of illusion.

# CHAPTER FIVE

# ( The Tripuras are fascinated)

Vyasa said:

1. When the ruler of the Asuras was initiated after being deluded by the deceptive sage expert in the magic art what did the sage say? What did the ruler of the Asuras do?

Sanatkum&#x26;ra said: —

After offering him initiation, the ascetic Arihan served by his disciples, Narada and others, spoke to the ruler of the Asuras.

Arihan said:

O ruler of the Asuras, listen to my statement, pregnant with wisdom. It is the essence of the Vedanta and bears high esoteric importance.
The entire universe is eternal. It has no creator nor it is an object of creation. It evolves itself and gets annihilated by itself.
There are many bodies from Brahma down to a blade of grass. They themselves are the gods for them. There is no other God.
What we mean by Brahma, Vi?nu and Rudra are only the names of embodied beings just like my name Arihan etc.
Just as our bodies perish when their time arrives, so also the bodies of all beings from Brahma to a mosquito perish when their time arrives.
When we consider, none of these bodies is superior to any other since in respect of taking food, copulation, sleep and fear these are invariably the same everywhere.
Taking in water and foodstuffs to the required quantity, all living beings derive a kindred satisfaction, neither more nor less.
After drinking water we are gladly relieved of thirst. Others too are equally relieved. There is no deviation this way or that.

11. There may be a thousand damsels of exquisite beauty and comely features. But only one of them can be used at a time for the sexual intercourse.

12. Let there be hundreds of horses, of different varieties. But for the purpose of riding only one can be used on one occasion.

13. The pleasure that one derives in that sleep on a cushioned couch is the same that one derives by sleeping on the bare ground.

14. Just as we, the embodied beings, are afraid of death so also the bodies from Brahma to the worm are afraid of death.

15. If we analyse with a keen intellect, all the embodied beings are equal. After coming to this conclusion it does not behove anyone to injure anyone else.

16. There is no other virtue equal to the mercy shown to living beings. Hence all men shall strenuously practise acts of mercy to living beings.

17. If a single living being is protected it amounts to the protection of the three worlds. If that is killed it amounts to the killing of all others. Hence it is our duty to protect and abstain from killing others.

18. Non-violence is the greatest virtue. Affliction of others is a great sin. Salvation is defined as non-dependence on others. Eating the food of our choice is heavenly bliss.

19. This has been mentioned by the earlier sages with good justification to be sure. Hence no violence should be indulged in by men who are afraid of hell.

20. There is no sin equal to violence in the three worlds, consisting of the mobile and immobile. A person who afflicts others violently goes to hell. A non-violent man goes to heaven.

21. There are many kinds of charitable gifts. Of what avail are these which give very insignificant results. There is no other gift equal to that of protection.

22. Four types of gifts have been mentioned by the great sages for the welfare of the people here and hereafter as a result of discussions and deliberations of various sacred texts.

23. Protection shall be granted to the frightened,

medicine to the sick, learning to the student and food to the hungry.

24. All sorts of charitable gifts recommended by the sages do not merit even a sixteenth part of the gift of protection to a living being.

25. The strength that one derives by the use of gems mantras, and herbs is of inconceivable influence. But it is practised strenuously only for earning money.

26. The hoarding and amassing of vast wealth is useful only for the propitiation of twelve organs of senses. Of what avail is the propitiation of other things?

27. The twelve organs of senses are the five organs of activity and the five organs of knowledge together with the mind and intellect.

28. Living beings have heaven and hell here itself and not anywhere else. Happiness is heaven and misery is hell.

29. If the body is cast off in the midst of enjoyment that is the greatest liberation conceived by the philosophers.

30. When pain comes to an end along with its impressions, if ignorance too dies away, it is conceived as the greatest salvation by the philosophers.

31. Supporters and exponents of the Vedas accept this as an authoritative Vedic text that no living being shall be injured. Violence is not justifiable.

32. The Vedic text encouraging slaughter of animals cannot be held authoritative by the learned. To say that violence is allowed in Agni stoma is an erroneous view of the wicked.

33. It is surprising that heaven is sought by cutting off trees, slaughtering animals, making a muddy mess with blood and by burning gingelly seeds and ghee.

34. Narrating his opinions to the leader of the Tripuras, the ascetic addressed the citizens with great zeal.

35. He referred to things which gave credence, being visible, which brought happiness to the body, which are indicated in Buddhistic theology and which are consistent with the Vedic passages.

36. It is said in the Vedas that Bliss is an aspect of the Brahman. That shall be taken as it is. It is false to bring in various alternatives.

37. One shall seek and enjoy happiness as long as the

# Rudrasaitihitd

body is hale and hearty, as long as the sense-organs are not impaired and as long as the old age is far off.

38. When there is sickness, impairment of the sense-organs and old age how can one derive happiness? Hence those who seek happiness shall be prepared to give away even the body.

39. The Earth is burdened by those who are not ready to please and satisfy the suppliant. It is not burdened by oceans, mountains and trees.

40. The body is ready to go in a trice, and hoarded things are attended with the risk of dwindling down. Realising this a sensible man shall see to the pleasure of his body.

41. It is mentioned in the Vedas that this body is going to constitute the breakfast for dogs, crows and worms. The body has its ultimate end in being reduced to ashes.

42. It is unnecessary to divide the people into different castes. When all are men who is superior and who is inferior?

43. Old men say that creation began with Brahma. He begot two sons the famous Daksa and Marlci.

44. KaSyapa, the son of Marici married thirteen of the sweet-eyed daughters of Daksa, they say, in accordance with righteous path.

45. But people of modern times whose intelligence and valour are but a modicum unnecessarily wrangle over the fact whether this is proper or improper.

46. Some of the ancestors thought that the four castes are born of mouth, arms, thighs etc. of Brahma. But when we consider, this does not fit in properly.

47. How can sons born of the same body or from the same body be of four different castes?

48. Hence the divisions of castes and outcastes do not appear to be sound. Hence no difference between man and man should be entertained.

Sanatkumdra said:

49. O sage, addressing the lord of the Asuras and the

citizens thus, the sage with his disciples spoiled the Vedic rites in a determined manner.

50. He then criticised the womanly virtues of chastity and manly virtues of continence etc.

51. Similarly he attacked and repudiated the divine rites, Sraddhika rites, sacrificial rites and holy observances and festivals, pilgrimages and anniversaries.

52. Worship of Siva, propitiation of his phallic form, adoration of Visnu, Sun, Gane€a and other deities in accordance with the sacred texts were repudiated by him.

53. The heretic sage, an expert in wielding magic art, foremost among the deceptive, criticised the ceremonial ablutions and charitable gifts that are made on auspicious occasions.

54. O foremost among brahmins, why shall I dilate upon this topic? Suffice it to say that in the three cities every type of Vedic rites was completely stopped by that deceptive heretic sage.

55. The women of the three cities who were hitherto devotedly attached to their husbands were deluded and misguided and they abandoned their noble inclinations to serve their husbands.

56. The fascinated men practised rites of seduction and winning over and made their artifices fruitful in gaining other men’s wives.

57. The attendant maids in the harems, the princes, the citizens and the ladies were perfectly enchanted by him.

58. Thus when the citizens became averse to virtuous rites and actions, evil reigned supreme.

59. At the bidding of lord Visnu, his magic art and evil fortune visited the three cities.

60. The glory that they had acquired by the boon of Brahma, the lord of the gods, went out forsaking them, at the behest of Brahma.

61. Blessing them with the utter delusion of their intellect, perpetrated by the illusion of Vi§nu, Narada became contented.

62. Though Narada and the heretic sage had been in that guise for long, they were not defiled, thanks to the benediction of lord Siva.

# ( Prayer to Siva )

Vydsa said :

1. When the ruler of the Asuras, his brothers and the citizens were thus deluded, O lord Sanatkumara, what happened? Please mention everything.

Sanalkumdra said :

2-3. When the Asuras had become so, when they had abandoned the worship of Siva, when the virtuous rites of chaste women came to an end and evil conduct came to stay, Visnu was apparently contented. Accompanied by the gods, Visnu went to Kailasa in order to intimate their activities to Siva.

4-5. Visnu, the gods, Brahma and others stood near him and with great concentration they meditated on him. Visnu and Brahma eulogised the omniscient Siva with pleasing words.

Vifnu said :

6. “Obeisance to you, great lord, the great soul, Narayana, Rudra and Brahma, obeisance to you in the form of Brahman.”

7. After eulogising lord Siva thus and prostrating at length, he repeated the mantra of DaksinamGrti Rudra.

8-9. He repeated the mantra fifteen million times standing in water and concentrating his mind on him. Lord Vi$nu meditated on the great lord Siva. In the meantime, the gods too eulogised him with devotion.

The gods said :

You are our ultimate goal for ever. You are the remover of all adversities. O destroyer of the enemies of the gods, you alone are to be respected by us always.

You are the beginning. You are the primordial being. You are self-bliss. You are the everlasting lord. You are the lord of the universe, the direct creator of Prakfti and Purusa.

# 13.

You alone are the creator, sustainer and the annihilator of the worlds. Assuming the Gunas of Rajas, Sattva, and Tamas you are Brahma, Visnu and Siva.

# 14.

In this universe, you enable people to cross the ocean of Existence. You are the undecaying lord of all. You are the granter of boons. You are the subject and not the object of speech and contents.

# 15.

You shall be requested for salvation by the Yogins, the foremost among those who know the theory of Yoga. You are stationed inside the lotus like heart of the Yogins.

# 16.

The Vedas and the saintly men speak of you as the supreme Brahman. You are a heaped mass of splendour and greater than the greatest. They call you the great principle.

What they call the great soul in the universe, O lord, are you yourself, O Siva soul of all, ruler of the three worlds.

24. The Srutis and those who know the essence of Srutis speak of you thus. You are the abode of all, the self-born and the knower of the essence of Srutis.

25. The various living beings created by you and to be created in future are invisible to us. The gods, the Asuras, the brahmins, nay, the mobile and immobile beings eulogise you alone.

26. O Siva, dear to the gods, save us, the gods who have no other go, by killing all the Asuras instantaneously. We are practically destroyed by the Tripuras.

27. O lord Siva, they are now deluded by your magic. O lord, they have gone astray from the virtuous path through the expedient taught by Visnu.

28. O lord, favourably disposed towards your devotees, those Asuras have resorted to Buddha’s religion and philosophy, thanks to our good fortune and hence they have eschewed all Vedic sacred rites.

29. You have always been the only one carrying out the task of the gods and the bestower of refuge. We have sought refuge in you. Please do as you desire.

Sanatkum&#x26;ra said:

30. After eulogising lord Siva thus, the distressed gods stood in front of him with palms joined in reverence and kneeling low.

187. Substitute for I The latter reading which is found in most of the printed editions of SivapurSga is incorrect. Cf. Liftgapurftga: 1. 71. 109.

According to the present text, the intellect, ego, mind, senses, gross and subtle elements, the invisible primordial nature (Pradhanaa), the individual soul (Jlva), the transcendent God (Iiyara) constitute a group of twenty-six categories wherein Jlva is the enjoyer of the fruits and Iivara is the spectator of the working of Prakrti. But there is another twenty-seventh category named Siva or Sadiiiva, the highest divine being (reiWmC) Who alone is capable of bestowing grace upon his devotees.

Eulogised thus by Indra and others and by the repetition of Japas by Viṣṇu, the delighted lord came there seated on his bull.

Getting from NandHa and embracing Viṣṇu, lord Siva delighted in his mind cast his benign look on all with his hand resting on Nandin.

# 33.

Casting a sympathetic glance on the gods, the delighted Siva, lord of Parvatī, spoke to Viṣṇu in a majestic tone.

Siva said:

# 34.

“O lord of gods, all the intentions of the gods have been understood by me now. The power of Visnu’s magic and that of the intelligent Narada has been known.

# 35.

O most excellent of the gods, there is no doubt in this that I will destroy the three cities of the Asuras if they persist in indulging in evil activities.

# 36.

But the great Asuras are my firm devotees. They shall be killed only by me, for they have been forced to abandon their excellent virtue under false persuasion.

# 37.

Let Viṣṇu or any one else slay them now that they have been made to abandon their Dharma. The Asuras of the three cities have become devoid of devotion to me.”

# 38.

O great sage, on hearing these words of Siva, all the heaven-dwellers and Viṣṇu became dispirited.

On seeing the gods and Viṣṇu sitting cheerless, Brahma, the creator of the worlds spoke to Siva with palms joined in reverence.

Brahma said:

There is no sin in this, since you are the foremost among those who know the Yogic theory; you are the great lord, the great Brahman and the saviour of gods and sages always.

# 41.

It is at your own bidding that they have been deluded. You induced them to be deluded. Although the Asuras have forsaken their duties and your worship, they cannot be killed by others.

43. As it is the duty of a king, you will not be sinning by their destruction. Hence, the good people, brahmins etc shall be saved and the thorns uprooted.

44. Even an ordinary king would do so if he cares to maintain his sway. You have the suzerainty of all the worlds. Hence, tarry not to protect us.

45. Great sages, Indra, sacrifices, Vedas, all the Sastras, Vijnu and even I— all these depend on you, O lord of gods.

46. O lord, you are the emperor of all deities, the lord of all. Visnu and the entire universe constitute your retinue. Visnu your O unborn is heir-apparent, one, I, Brahma, am your priest and Sukra who carries out your behests is the Royal officer.

47. The other gods too, O lord, are subjects to your control. They continue to perform their own duties. True. It is undoubtedly true.

Sanatkumdra said:

49. On hearing the words of Brahma, Siva, the delighted lord of the gods replied to Brahma.

Siva said: —

50. O Brahma, if I am to be proclaimed the emperor of the gods, I do not have the paraphernalia characteristic of my lordship.

51. I do not have a divine chariot and a divine charioteer. I do not possess bows and arrows which accord victory in a battle.

52. If there had been a chariot I could have sat in it and with bow and arrows I could have killed even powerful Asuras, with a resolute determination.

Sanatkumdra said: On hearing the words of the gods and others, Siva accepted the proposal. The lord is worthy of being sought refuge and is also favourably disposed to his devotees.

6. O sage, in the meantime the goddess Parvati arrived there with the two sons where Siva was in conversation with the gods.

2. On seeing Parvati come there, Visnu and others were surprised but without agitation they bowed to her in great humility.

3. O sage, they shouted cries of “Victory”. But unable to know the cause of her arrival, they remained silent.

4. On being eulogised by the gods, the goddess Parvati full of wonderful enthusiasm spoke lovingly to her lord, an expert in different kinds of sports. The goddess said:

“O lord, see the sportive six-faced1 Karttikcya,

2. He recollected the Asuras who had come (to fight and) pounded by his splendrous valour. Embracing and kissing Skanda on the head lord Siva rejoiced much.
3. Then the mother of the universe stayed there for a while and held conversation with the lord. Afterwards the goddess, an expert in different kinds of sports stood up.
4. Then Siva of good sports entered his apartment accompanied by Nandin and Parvati. He was then saluted by all the gods.

Together and approached Brahma and Viṣṇu of friendly temperament.

19. The sages Kaiyapa and others said to Viṣṇu who removes the fear of all the worlds “O this is due to our ill luck.” The other brahmins said—“Our task not completed due to—our ill luck.” Still others who were greatly surprised said “How did this obstacle happen?”

20. O sage, on hearing these words of Kalyapa and others, Viṣṇu consoled the sages and the gods and spoke thus. Viṣṇu said:

21. O gods, O sages, you listen to my words with attention. Why are you distressed? Eschew your sorrows.

22. O gods ponder over this. This propitiation of the great is not an easy task. It is heard that there is great difficulty at first in propitiating the great. The lord will certainly be pleased after coming to know of your resolute nature.

23. Let this be pondered over well by all of you, how can lord Siva, the presiding deity of the Ganas be made favourable immediately.

24-25. O scholars, the following mantra shall be repeated—Utter the syllable Omkara first, then repeat the word Namah (obeisance). Then say Sivaya (to Siva). Then “Subham” twice and “Kuru”. Afterwards say “Namah Om.”

26. If you repeat this mantra a crore times thinking of Siva, Siva will carry out the task.

27. O sage, when this was mentioned by Viṣṇu the powerful, the gods began to propitiate Siva.

28. For the fulfilment of the task of the gods and the sages, Viṣṇu and Brahma, with minds fixed in Siva performed the Japa. O excellent sage, they stood there steady and repeated the mantra a crore times uttering the name “Siva” several times.

Lord Siva said:

37. Hence make arrangements for the chariot, charioteer, divine bow and excellent arrows as agreed to by you all. Do not delay.

38. O Brahma, O Visnu, you are the lord of the three worlds, to be sure. Hence provide me with the paraphernalia of an emperor.

39. You too had been entrusted with the tasks of creation and sustenance. You shall make all efforts, considering the destruction of the three cities an act of help to the gods.

Vyasa said:

1. O Sanatkumara, of good intellect, O omniscient one, O foremost among the devotees of Siva, this wonderful story of lord Siva has been narrated to us.

2. Now please mention the structure of the chariot which consisted of all the gods and which had been made by the intelligent Viśvakarman.

Sanatkumara said:

3. On hearing these words of Vyasa, Sanatkumara the great sage remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and spoke thus.

Sanatkumara said:

4. O sage Vyasa, of great intellect, listen to the description of the structure of the chariot etc which I shall give to the extent of my intellect after remembering the lotus-like feet of Siva.

5. The divine chariot of lord Siva consisting of all the worlds was built by Viśvakarman with devoted effort.

The six seasons constituted the rims of the wheels of the chariot, O great Brahmin. The Puskara of the chariot was the sky. The inner side of the chariot was Mandara.

The rising and the setting mountains constituted the poleshafts. Mahameru was the support and the Ketara mountains the sharp sides.

The year constituted its velocity. The two Ayanas northern and southern constituted the junctions of the wheels and axles. The Muhurtas constituted the joints and the Kalas the pins of the yoke.

# 12.

The division of time Kasfha constituted the nose of the chariot and the Ksanas the axle-shaft. The Nimejas constituted the bottom of the carriage and the minutest divisions of time constituted the poles.

The firmament constituted the fender of the chariot; Heaven and salvation the flag staffs; Abhramu and Kamadhenu constituted its harrows at the end of the shafts.

19. The clouds constituted the gem-studded banners of glowing colours. The four oceans are remembered as the bullocks of the chariot.

20. Ganga and other rivers shining in excellent female forms and decorated in all ornaments held the Camaras in their hands.

21. Taking up their places in the different parts of the chariot, they brightened it up. The seven courses of the wind Avaha etc. constituted the excellent steps of gold leading the chariot.

22. The Lokaloka mountain formed its side steps. The lake manasa etc. constituted its brilliant outer and oblique steps.

23. The Varsa mountains constituted the cords and chains all round the chariot. All the residents of the region Tala constituted the bottom surface of the chariot.

24. Lord Brahma was the charioteer, the gods were holders of the bridle. Pranava the Vedic divinity constituted the long whip of Brahma.

# CHAPTER NINE

# (Siva's campaign)

Sanalkumdra said:

1. Brahma handed over that divine chariot of various wonderful features to Siva after yoking the Vedas as the horses.
2. After dedicating the same to Siva, he requested Siva the lord of the gods, approved by Visnu and other gods to mount the chariot.
3. The great lord Siva identifying himself with all the gods got into that chariot that had various scaffoldings attached to it.
4. He was then eulogised by the gods, Gandharvas, serpents, sages, Visnu, Brahma and the guardians of the quarters.
5. 6. Siva, the granter of boons, surrounded by the groups of damsels, experts in music, shone well. Glancing at the charioteer when he mounted the chariot concocted with everything in the world, the horses constituted by the Vedas fell headlong to the ground.
6. The earth quaked. The mountains became tremulous. Sesa, unable to bear his weight, became distressed and soon began to tremble.
7. Lord Visnu assumed the form of a lordly bull and went under the chariot. He lifted it up and steadied it for a short while.
8. But in another instant, unable to bear the weighty splendour of lord Siva seated in the chariot, the lordly bull had to kneel down and crawl on the ground.
9. 10-12. But the lord touched the bridle and steadied the horses. Then Brahma seated in the excellent chariot drove the excellent chariot with the velocity of mind and wind, at the bidding of the lord towards the three cities of the valiant.

Asuras. The cities were then in the sky. Lord Siva was seated inside.

13. Then lord Siva looked at the gods and said, “Give me the lordship of the animals. Then I shall kill the Asuras.

14. O excellent gods, the excellent Asuras can be killed only after assigning separate animalhood to the gods and others. Not otherwise.”

Sanatkumdra said:

15. On hearing these words of the intelligent lord of the gods, they became dispirited growing suspicious of animalhood.

16. On knowing what was passing through their minds, Siva, the lord of the gods, the consort of Parvati sympathised with the gods and laughingly said.

Siva said:

17. “O excellent gods, you will not fall even in your animalhood. Let it be heard, and let the process of release from animalhood be practised.

18. He who performs the divine rite of Pasupata will be released from animalhood. I promise this to you. Be attentive.

19. O excellent gods, there is no doubt about it that those who perform my PaSupata rite will become liberated.

20. He who renders service perpetually or for twelve years, becomes relieved of animalhood.

21. Hence O excellent gods, perform this divine rite. You will be released from animalhood. There is no doubt about this.”

rqi. Siva is named Pasupati, the lord of animals. According to the legend, recorded in the present chapter, every deity was asked by Siva to declare himself a mere Pasu or animal before Tripuras could be slain in the battle. The Gods accepted the proposal, declared themselves as animals and fought brutally. Lord Siva won them the battle but Gods were still distressed. The lord then enjoined the observance of Pa*upata Vrata for the attainment of release from their animal nature.

This legend forms the basis for the formulation of Pisupata sect which aims at the release of a Pa>u (the individual soul) from the bondage of re-birth.

Santakumara said:

1. On hearing these words of lord Siva, the great soul, Visnu, Brahma and other gods said, “So be it.”
2. Hence all the gods and Asuras became the animals of the lord. Siva became the lord of animals. He is the person who unties the nooses of the animals.
3. Then the name PaSupati, that bestows welfare, spread in all the worlds and became renowned.
4. Then the celestial sage, Indra, Brahma, Vi$nu and others rejoiced shouting “Victory.”
5. Even in hundreds of years it is impossible to describe adequately the form of the great soul which he assumed then.
6. Siva the lord of Parvati and everyone, the bestower of happiness to all, went ahead to destroy the three cities.
7. Then all the gods, resplendent like the sun, under the lord of the gods and others went on elephants, horses, lions, bulls and chariots to kill Tripuras, leaders of the Asuras.
8. The leading gods as huge as mountains went ahead delighted and well-armed with all sorts of missiles, plough-shares, mortars, iron clubs and uprooted trees as huge as mountains.
9. Then Indra, Brahma, Visnu and others went ahead of lord Siva jubilantly shouting cries of victory to Siva, well-armed with various weapons and shining brilliantly.
10. Sages with matted hair and staffs in the hands rejoiced. Siddhas and Caranas moving about in the sky showered flowers.
11. O great brahmins, all the Ganesvaras went to the three cities. Who can enumerate them fully? I shall mention a few.
12. Bhrhgin, the chief of all Ganesas, surrounded by lord of Ganas and gods went speedily to destroy the three cities like Mahendra seated in an aerial chariot.
13. These were the important ones who were there— Ke$a, Vigatavasa, Mahakesa, Mahajvara, Somavallisavarna, Somapa, Sfcnaka, Somadhrk, Suryavarcas, Suryaprejanaka, Suryak$a, Surinaman, Sura, Sundara, Pra^kanda, Kundara.

These and other innumerable lords of Ganas who cannot be characterised and classified surrounded Siva and went ahead.

40. They were capable of burning the entire world including the mobile and immobile beings, within a trice by their very thought. Surrounding Siva, the great lord, they went ahead.

41. Siva is capable of burning the entire world. Of what avail are the Ganas, gods, chariot, and arrows to Siva in order to burn the three cities?

42. O Vyasa, that trident-bearing lord, of wonderful power of causing enjoyment and protection, himself went there with his own Ganas and the gods to burn the three cities of the enemies of gods.

43. What the reason was, I shall tell you, O excellent sage. It was to make his glory known to all the worlds, the glory that dispels all sins and dirt.

44. Another reason was to convince the wicked, since there is none to excel him among the gods.

# CHAPTER TEN

# (The burning of the Tripuras)

Sanatkumdra said: —

1. Then Siva, the great lord, seated in the chariot and equipped with everything, got ready to burn the three cities completely, the cities of the enemies of the gods.

The Puranas accord different versions of the burning of Tripura. The present version is a regular legend based on an ancient tradition. There is however another version which describes graphically the devastation, oppression and barbarities practised by the Ganas which remind us of those perpetrated by the Hupa-chief Mihirakula in his invasions. There is a veiled allusion to this event, for Agni is addressed as a Mleccha (Matsya p. 168. 31). There is no such anachronism in the account of Tripuradāha.

5. Then from the firmament, the odd-eyed Siva who was standing there holding the bow and the arrow heard an auspicious voice.

6. “O lord of the master of the universe, you will not kill the Tripuras as long as the lord Ganesa is not adored.”

7. On hearing these words, Siva the destroyer of Andhaka called Bhadrakall and worshipped the elephant-faced god Ganesa.

8-9. When Ganesa was worshipped, when he standing ahead was pleased, lord Siva saw the three cities of the powerful Asuras, sons of Taraka, joined together.

10. It is said that when the great lord Siva, the lord of the Gods, the supreme Brahman, worshipped by all is there, it is not proper to say that he achieved success by another God’s grace.

11. He is independent, the great Brahman, both possessed and devoid of attributes. He is invisible, the supreme soul and unsullied.

12. He is the soul of five divinities. He is worshipped by the five deities1. He is the great lord. There is none else worthy of worship. He is the ultimate abode of all.

13. Or, O sage, the activities of Siva, the lord of the Gods, the granter of boons are but proper inasmuch as they constitute his divine sports.

14. When the great God stood up after worshipping Siva, the three cities joined together into one unit.

15. O sage, when the three cities came to a unified

197. The five gods Brahma, Vi$nu, Rudra, Skanda and Indra (See $P. VS 14 48) are in essence identical with Siva but they have also their distinct forms in which they remain subservient to him. According to another version, the five deities are the son, Gapeia, Durgi, Rudta and Vi§nu. Sec note 174 P. 168.

whole, a tumultuous shout of joy rose up among the noble Gods and others.

# 16.

Then all the Gods, Siddhas and the sages shouted out “Victory” and eulogised Siva who has eight cosmic bodies1.

# 17-18.

Then Brahma and Visnu, the lord of the worlds said — “The time for killing the Asuras has arrived, O great God. The three cities of the sons of Taraka have come into one unified whole. O lord, please perform the task of the Gods.

# 19.

O lord of the gods please discharge the arrow and reduce the three cities to ashes lest they should be separated again.”

# 20.

Then stringing the bow tight and fixing the arrow Palupata worthy of worship, he thought of the Tripuras.

# 21.

Then lord Siva, an expert in excellent divine sports for some reason looked at it with contempt.

# 22.

Siva is capable of reducing the three cities to ashes in a trice, Still lord Siva, the goal of the good bides his time.

# 23.

The lord of gods is capable of burning the three worlds by a single glance. O lord, for the flourish of our fame you shall discharge the arrow.

# 24.

On being eulogised by Visnu, Brahma and other gods, lord Siva desired to reduce the three cities to ashes with his arrow.

# 25-26.

In the auspicious moment called Abhila$a he drew the bow and made a wonderful and unbearable twanging sound. He addressed the great Asuras and proclaimed his own name. Siva discharged an arrow that had the refulgence of countless suns.

# 27.

The arrow which was constituted by Visnu and whose steel head was fire god blazed forth and burnt the three Asuras who lived in the three cities. It thereby removed their sins.

# 28.

The three cities reduced to ashes fell on the earth girt by the four oceans1.

Sec Note 89 P. 13a. four oceans are laid be

In ancient Indian literature, the surrounding the earth on four tides. Mon probably they represent the Arabian sea in the West, the Indian ocean in the south, the Bay of Bengal in the East and the sea of Japan in the North.

29. Since they had refrained from the worship of Siva, hundreds of Asuras were burnt by the fire generated by the arrow. They cried “Ha Ha” in distress.

30. Tarakaksa was burnt along with his two brothers. He remembered his lord Siva who is favourably disposed to his devotees.

31. Lamenting in diverse ways and looking up to lord Siva, he mentally appealed to him.

Tarakaksa said:

32. “O Siva, you are known to be pleased with us, if at any future hour you burn us, you will do so along with our kinsfolk. Let it be in accordance with this truth.

33. What is difficult and inaccessible to the gods and Asuras has been secured by us. Let our intellect be purified by our thoughts on you in every birth.”

34. O sage, at the bidding of Siva, those Asuras were burnt and reduced to ashes by the fire even as they were muttering thus.

35. Other Asuras too, children and old men were completely burnt out, O Vyasa, at the bidding of Siva and speedily reduced to ashes.

36. Just as the universe is burnt at the end of a Kalpa so also everything and everyone there, whether woman or man or vehicles, was reduced to ashes by that fire.

37. Some women were forced to leave their husbands necking them and were burnt by the fire. Some were sleeping, some were intoxicated and some were exhausted after their sexual dalliance. All were burnt.

38-39. Some who were partially burnt woke up and rushed here and there. They fell unconscious and fainted. There was not even a minute particle whether mobile or immobile which escaped unscathed by that terrible Tripura fire excepting Maya, the imperishable ViSvakarman of the Asuras.

200. For the detailed description of the burning of Tripura compare Matsya P. Ch. i 3.

40. Those who were not opposed to the Gods were saved by Siva’s brilliance, those who devoutly sought refuge in lord Siva at the time of adversity.

41. Whether Asuras or other beings those whose collective activities were not destructive were saved; others of contrary activities were burnt in fire.

42. Hence, all possible efforts shall be made by good men to avoid despicable activities whereby people waste away themselves.

43. Let there be no predicament to any as it happened in regard to the residents of the three cities. This is the opinion of all. By chance if it happens, let it.

44. Those who worshipped Siva along with their family attained Ganapati’s region, thanks to the worship of Siva.

# {The Gods' prayer}

Vydsa said:

1. O son of Brahma, of great intellect, O most excellent among the devotees of Siva, you are blessed. When the three cities were burnt what did the gods do?

2. Where did Maya who was spared go? Where did the ascetics go? Please narrate all, if it relates to Siva’s story.

Sftta said:

3. On hearing the words of Vyasa, Sanatkumara the holy son of the creator remembered the feet of Siva and spoke.

Sanatkumara said:

4. Listen O Vyasa, son of ParaSara, and of great intellect, to the sin-destroying story of the great lord, who follows worldly conventions.

5. When the three cities of Asuras were utterly burnt, the Gods became surprised.

6. The gods including Indra, Vi$nu and others became silent and bewildered on seeing the excessively brilliant Siva.

# 7-8.

On merely seeing the terrible form of Siva, dazzling the ten quarters, resembling countless suns in refulgence and on a par with the fire at the hour of dissolution, and also the goddess Parvati, the daughter of Himavat, the illustrious gods stood humbly in their fright.

# 9.

On seeing the army of the gods terrified, the excellent sages did not say anything. They stood all round and bowed.

# 10-11.

Then Brahma too who was excessively afraid on seeing Siva’s terrible form, was delighted at heart and fervently prayed along with the gods. Visnu who was also afraid prayed to Siva the lord of the Gods, the slayer of the Tripuras, who was accompanied by his consort Parvati, the lord who is subservient to his devotees.

22. Then Brahma himself eulogised lord Siva the destroyer of the Tripuras after bowing to him with stooping shoulders and palms joined in reverence. Brahma said:

SanatkumSra said:

25. After thus eulogising Siva who is favourably disposed to his devotees, with humility, the liberal hearted Brahma stopped and stood there with stooping shoulders and palms joined in reverence.

The gods said:

On hearing this eulogy of Maya, O excellent brahmin, lord Siva, was delighted and he spoke to Maya eagerly.

Siva said:

O Maya, I am delighted. O excellent Asura speak out the boon you wish to have. There is no doubt. I shall grant you what you desire.

3. O sage, once Brhaspati and Indra went to Kailasa with great devotion, to see lord Siva.

4-5. Coming to know of the arrival of Brhaspati and Indra eager to see him, lord Siva wished to test their knowledge. Accordingly, the lord, the excellent goal of the good, stood blocking their path in the naked form with matted hair and beaming face.

6-9. Brhaspati and Indra were walking on gleefully. On their way they saw this wonderful person of huge size. He was quiet and composed and very refulgent with matted hair on his head. He was fair-complexioned with long arms and wide chest. He was terrible to look at. Without realizing that the person who stood there blocking their path...

Indra said —

What 10. O, who are you? Where have you come from? Is your name? Tell me truly. Is the lord Siva in his apartment or has he gone anywhere?

Sanatkumdra said:

11. O sage, on being asked by Indra thus, he did not say anything. Indra asked him again. But the naked person did not say anything.

12. Indra, the supreme lord of the worlds, asked again. The lord the great Yagin who assumes forms variously kept quiet.

13. The naked lord, though asked repeatedly by Indra, did not say anything, for he wanted to test the knowledge of Indra.

14. Then the lord of Gods, proud of the wealth of the three worlds, became enraged. Rebuking the lord with matted hair he spoke these words.

Indra said:

15. “O evil-minded one, though asked you did not reply to me. Hence I am going to kill you with my thunderbolt. Who can save you?”

Sanatkumdra said:

16. After saying this and looking at him ferociously Indra raised his thunderbolt in order to kill him.

17. On seeing Indra lifting up his thunderbolt, Siva prevented the fall of the thunderbolt by making his hand benumbed.

18. Then Siva became furious. His eyes became terrible. He blazed with his burning splendour.

19. Then Indra burnt within himself by the benumbing of his arm like a serpent whose exploits had been curbed by pronouncing magical formulas.

On seeing him resplendent, Brhaspati realised immediately that he was lord Siva himself and bowed to him.

# 21.

Then the noble-minded Brhaspati joined his palms in reverence. He prostrated before him on the ground and began to eulogise the lord.

# 22.

Obeisance to Siva, the chief lord of the gods, the supreme soul, the three-eyed, possessed of matted hair.

# 23.

Obeisance to the succouring lord of the distressed, the destroyer of Andhaka and the Tripuras, and identical with Brahma, the Paramesfhin.

# 24.

Obeisance to Siva of odd eyes, of diverse, deformed and surpassing features, going beyond all forms.

# 25.

Obeisance to the destroyer of sacrifice of Dak$a, to the bestower of fruits of sacrifice, identical with sacrifice and the initiator of the greatest rites.

# 26.

Obeisance to Siva the annihilator of Time, of the form of Time, the wearer of black serpents, the great lord and the omnipresent.

# 27.

Obeisance to the destroyer of Brahma’s head, the one eulogised by Brahma and the moon. Obeisance to you favourably disposed to Brahmins. Obeisance to you the great soul.

# 28.

You are the fire, the wind, the ether, the waters, the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the solar system.

# 29.

You alone are Visnu, Brahma, and eulogised by them; you are the great lord, the sages Sanaka etc. You are Narada the great saint.

# 30.

You alone are the lord of all the worlds, the soul of the universe. You are converging in everything and different from everything; you alone are greater than Prakfti.

204. Andhaka was an Asura of great prowess who became so arrogant that he attempted to abduct both Siva and P&#x26;rvati. A great battle was fought between the two in the Mab&#x26;kala forest of Avanti. Siva slew the Asura and obtained the appellation ‘the slayer of Andhaka’ for himself.

31. With the Rajas attribute, you alone create the worlds assuming the name Brahma. You are identical with Visnu in Sattva attribute and you protect the entire universe.

32. With the Tamas attribute you assume the form of Siva, O great God and you alone devour the universe composed of five elements.

33. With the strength of meditating on you, creator of the universe, the sun blazes, the moon exudes nectar and the wind blows.

34. O Siva, with the strength of meditating on you, the clouds shower water. Indra protects the worlds like his sons.

35. With the strength of meditating on you, the clouds, the gods and the great sages carry on their tasks. They are afraid of you.

36. O Siva, by serving your lotus like feet, the people in the world do not honour the gods and they enjoy the prosperity of the world.

37. By serving your lotus like feet the people attain the supreme goal inaccessible to every one and unattainable even to Yogins.

Sanatkumdra said:

38. After eulogising Siva, the benefactor of the worlds thus Brhaspati made Indra fall at the feet of Siva.

39. After making Indra, lord of the gods, fall at his feet with bowed head, Brhaspati humbly spoke these words to Siva with bowed head.

Brhaspati said:

40. O great lord, favourable to the distressed, please raise up Indra fallen at your feet. Please quieten the anger rising from your eyes.

41. O great lord, be pleased. Protect Indra who has sought refuge in you. Let this fire rising from the eye in the forehead be rendered calm.

Sanatkumdra said:

42. On hearing these words of Brhaspati, Siva...

862 itvapurdna lord of Gods, the ocean of mercy, spoke in a thundering stentorian voice.

Lord Siva said :

# 43.

O Brhaspati, how can I take up the fury that has already come out of my eye? A serpent does not wear again the slough that has been cast off.

# 44.

On hearing these words of Siva, Brhaspati’s mind was agitated with fear and he spoke dejectedly.

# 45.

O holy lord, indeed the devotees should be pitied always. O Siva, thus please make your name Bhaktavatsala (favourably disposed towards the devotees) true.

# 46.

O lord of gods, you deserve to cast elsewhere the fierce brilliance. O uplifter of all devotees, raise up Indra.

# 47.

On being addressed thus by Brhaspati the delighted Siva, the destroyer of the distress of those who bow to him and the one named Bhaktavatsala replied thus to Brhaspati.

# 48.

O dear one, I am delighted by your eulogy. I shall grant you the excellent boon. Henceforth you shall be famous as Enlivener because you have conferred life on Indra.

# 49.

I shall cast off this fire born of my eye in the forehead intended to kill Indra lest it should afflict him.

# 50.

On saying this he held that wonderful brilliance born of the eye in the forehead and cast it off in the briny ocean.

# 51.

Then the lord Rudra of great divine sports vanished.

206. Siva is represented as the three eyed God. His third eye which stands in the middle of his forehead is very destructive. It reduced Kama to ashes. This eye usually remains closed. But when it opens, glance works havoc. At the periodical dissolution of the universe, it destroys all the gods and created beings.

ed from the scene. Brhaspati and Indra were relieved of their fright and they became happy.

52. After having the immediate perception of Siva for which they had come here, Brhaspati and Indra became contented and went away to their abodes joyously.

# CHAPTER FOURTEEN

# (The birth of Jalandhara and his marriage)

Vy&#x26;sa said: —

1. O omniscient Sanatkumara, son of Brahma, obeisance be to you. This wonderful story of Siva, the great soul, has been heard.

2. O sage, when the brilliance born of the eye in the forehead had been cast off into the briny ocean, O dear sir, what happened? Please narrate it quickly.

Sanatkumara said:

3. O dear one of great intellect, listen to the extremely wonderful sport of Siva, on hearing which with faith a devotee attains the goal of Yogins.

4. The brilliance of Siva born of the eye in the forehead and cast off into the briny sea 207 immediately assumed the form of a boy.

5. At the confluence of the river Gariga and the ocean, the boy of terrific features cried loudly.

6. At the sound of the crying boy, the earth quaked frequently. The heaven and the Satyaloka became deafened at the noise.

7. All the worlds were frightened. The guardians of the quarters became agitated in the mind.

8. O dear holy one, O great brahmin, the entire world including the mobile and immobile quaked at the cries of the boy.

9. Then the distressed gods and the sages immediately

207. The ocean of salt (lavai?4mbhodhi) stands to the west of Bh&#x26;ratavarya and is identical with the Arabian sea. The confluence of the Indus and this ocean (Sindhu-Sigara-sartgama) is the place where Jalandhara was born.

sought refuge in Brahma the grandfather and preceptor of the worlds.

10. After going there, those sages and the gods including Indra bowed to and eulogised Brahma and spoke these words.

11. The gods said: O “This mysterious sound has arisen. O lord of worlds, lord of gods, we are frightened. O great Yogin please quell it.”

Sanatkumdra said:

12. On hearing their words, Brahma the grandfather of the worlds wished to go there. He was perplexed as to what it was.

13. Then Brahma descended from Satyaloka to the Earth along with the gods. Then he went to the ocean desirous of knowing what it was.

14. When Brahma the grandfather of the worlds came there, he saw the boy in the lap of the ocean.

15. On seeing Brahma coming, the ocean assuming the form of a god bowed to him and placed the boy in his lap.

16. Then the surprised Brahma spoke these words to the ocean: “O ocean, tell me quickly about the parentage of this boy.”

Sanatkumdra said:

17. On hearing the words of Brahma, the ocean was delighted. After bowing to and eulogising him with palms joined in reverence he replied to Prajapati Brahma.

The ocean said:

18. “O Brahma, O lord of the worlds, this boy was suddenly seen in the confluence of the river Ganga. I do not know about the origin of this boy.

19. O preceptor of the universe, you perform the post-natal rites for this boy. O creator, let me know your predictions about his future according to his horoscope.”



---


# Rudrasartihita

Sanatkumdra said :

20. Even as the ocean said these words, the son of the ocean caught hold of the neck of Brahma and shook it several times.

21. In due course tears came out of the eyes of Brahma, the creator of all the worlds, afflicted by the joggling and jolting.

22. Brahma somehow extricated himself from the grip of the son of the ocean by means of his hands and spoke to the ocean.

Brahma said :

23. “O ocean, listen, I shall narrate the future as predicted from the horoscope, entirely. Be attentive please.

24. Since he was able to make my eyes water let him be famous in the name of Jalandhara.

25-26. He will become a youth now itself. He will become a master of all sacred lores, very valorous, courageous, heroic, invincible and majestic like you. Like Karttikeya he will be the conqueror of all in battles. He will shine with all sorts of prosperity.

27. This boy will become the emperor of Asuras. He will conquer even Visnu. He will face defeat from no quarter.

28. He cannot be slain by anyone except Siva. He will return to the place from where he sprang up.

29. His wife will be a chaste lady who will increase good fortune. She will be exquisitely beautiful in every limb. She will be an ocean of good conduct and will speak pleasing words.

Sanatkumdra said :

30. After saying so he called Sukra and performed his coronation. Brahma then took leave of the ocean and disappeared.

31. Thereafter the ocean with blooming eyes saw the son, took him to his abode joyously.

32. With a joyous heart he nurtured the boy with diverse great means. The boy grew into a beautiful youth of exquisite limbs and wonderful splendour.



---


Then the ocean invited the great Asura Kalanemi and requested him to give his daughter named Vrnda in marriage to his son.

O sage, the heroic Asura Kalanemi, foremost among the Asuras, intelligent and efficient in his activities, welcomed the request of the ocean.

He gave his beloved daughter to Jalandhara, the brave son of the ocean, in marriage performing the nuptial rites according to the Brahma style.

O sage, great festivities were held in the marriage. The rivers and Asuras were happy.

The ocean too became extremely happy seeing his son united to a bride. In accordance with the rules he made charitable gifts to the brahmins and others.

Those Asuras who had been formerly defeated by the gods and had sought shelter in Patala came fearlessly to the Earth and resorted to him.

Kalanemi and other Asuras were pleased after giving the daughter in marriage to the son of the ocean. In order to defeat the gods they resorted to him.

The heroic son of the ocean, Jalandhara, foremost among the Asura warriors, received a very beautiful lady as his wife and he ruled over the kingdom with the support of Sukra.

# CHAPTER FIFTEEN

# (The fight between the gods and Jalandhara)

Once the son of the ocean, the noble-hearted husband of Vrnda, was seated along with his wife and the Asuras.

The brilliant Bhargava came there joyously illuminating the ten quarters as the embodied brilliance.

On seeing the preceptor coming, the Asuras were ao8. Kilanemi, the great Asura, was the son of Virocana and the great-grandson of Hiranyakahpu. His daughter Vrnda was married to Jalandhara.

delighted in their minds and bowed to him. The son of the ocean too respectfully bowed to him.

4. After bestowing his benediction on them, Bhargava, the storehouse of splendour, sat on a beautiful seat. They too resumed their seats as before.

5. Then the heroic son of the ocean, Jalandhara, saw his Assembly and was delighted to observe that his sway was unmitigated.

6. Seeing the headless Rahu seated there, the son of the ocean, the emperor of the Asuras, immediately asked Bhargava.

8. Jalandhara said: O lord, by whom was this done to Rahu? By whom was his head cut? Please tell me, O preceptor, everything in detail as it had happened.

Sanatkumdra said: On hearing the words of the ocean’s son, Bhargava remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and replied exactly as it had happened.

Bhargava said: 9- O Jalandhara, O great hero, O benefactor of the Asuras, listen to the account. I shall relate everything exactly as it had happened.

10. Once there was a strong hero Bali, the son of Virocana and great-grandson of HiranyakaSipu. He was foremost among the virtuous.

11. The gods including Indra being defeated by him sought refuge in Vi?nu. Eager to gain their ends they told him all details.

12. O dear, at his bidding, the gods, very clever in deception, made an alliance with the Asuras, to further their own interest.

13. All those gods, the assistants of Visnu churned 209. The Asura Rahu, son of Vipracirti and SijhhikS, is known as the guardian of the south-west quarter. It is said that when the gods produced the Amrta by churning the ocean, he disguised himself as a god and drank some of it. But he was detected by the gods and produced before Vigpu who cut off his head.

the ocean eagerly for the gain of nectar, along with the Asuras.

14. The enemies of the Asuras extracted jewels from the ocean. The gods seized the nectar and drank it deceitfully.

15. Then the gods including Indra increased in strength and prowess by the drinking of the nectar and harassed the Asuras with the assistance of Vi$nu.

16. This Visnu who is always a partisan of Indra, cut off the head of Rahu as he was drinking the nectar along with the gods.

Sanaikumdra said:

17-18. Thus Bhargava narrated in detail the story of the headless Rahu, of the churning of the ocean pursued by the gods for the gain of nectar, of the removal of the jewels, of the drinking of the Amrta by the gods and of the harassment to the Asuras.

19. Then on hearing about the churning of his father, the heroic son of the ocean, the valorous Jalandhara became furious and his eyes turned red with anger.

20. Then he called his excellent emissary Ghasmara and told him everything what the wise preceptor had said to him.

21. He then lovingly honoured the clever emissary in various ways, assured him of protection and sent him to Indra as his messenger.

22. Ghasmara, the intelligent emissary of Jalandhara, hastened to heaven where all the gods were present.

23. After going there, the emissary entered the assembly of the gods. With his head kept straight as a token of haughtiness he spoke to lord Indra.

Ghasmara said:

24. Jalandhara, the son of the ocean, is the lord and emperor of all the Asuras. He is excessively heroic and valorous. He has the support and assistance of Bhargava.

aio. Trivi;t*P* or Tripiftapa is the city of Indra supposed to be situated on Mount Meru.

25. I am his emissary. I have been sent by him. I have come to you here. My name is Ghasmara but I am not a devourer.

26. He is of exalted intellect. His behest has never been defied. He has defeated all the enemies of Asuras. Please listen to what he says.

Jalandhara said:

27. “O base god, why was my father, the ocean, churned by you with the mountain? Why were all the jewels of my father taken away?

28. What you have done is not proper. Return all of them to me immediately. Pondering over this, come along with the gods and seek refuge in me.

29. Otherwise, O base god, you will have a great cause to fear. You will run the risk of the annihilation of your kingdom.”

Sanatkumara said:

30. On hearing the words of the messenger, Indra, the lord of the gods, was bewildered. Remembering the previous incidents he was frightened as well as angry. He spoke to him thus.

31. Indra said. He gave shelter to the mountains who were terribly afraid of me. Others too, some of my enemies, the Asuras, were formerly saved by him.

32. It was due to this that I took away his jewels. Those who oppose me can never remain happy. I am telling you the truth.

33. Formerly the Asura Sankha²¹² the son of the ocean was stupid enough to be inimical to me. He was spared by me because he was associated with saintly men.

34. But when his predilection became sinful and he became violent towards saintly men, he was killed in the interior of the ocean by Visnu, my younger brother.

a i a. The Aiura SaAkha was killed by Vi?nu for his defiant and oppressive attitude.

# Sivapurdna

Hence O messenger, go immediately and explain to the Asura, son of the ocean, our purpose for churning the.

Sanatkum&#x26;ra said:

# 36.

Dismissed thus by Indra, the intelligent emissary Ghasmara hastened to the place where the heroic Jalandhara was present.

# 37.

All the words thus spoken by Indra were narrated to the king of Asuras by the intelligent emissary.

# 38.

On hearing it, the lips of the Asura throbbed with anger. Desirous of conquering the gods he exerted himself immediately.

# 39.

In that enterprise of the lord of the Asuras, countless Asuras from all the quarters and the nether region took part and helped him.

# 40.

Then the extremely heroic and valorous son of the ocean set forth with countless generals, Sumbha, Ni$umbha and others.

# 41.

Very soon, he reached the heaven along with his force. He blew his conch. All the heroic soldiers roared.

# 42.

After going to heaven he stationed himself in Nandana. In the midst of all his forces he roared like a lion.

# 43.

On seeing a vast army surrounding the city, the gods came out of Amaravati fully equipped with armour for the battle.

# 44-45.

Then a battle between the armies of the gods and Asuras ensued. They rushed against one another with iron clubs, arrows, maces, axes and spears. They hit one another. Within a short time both the armies began to wade through streams of blood.

# 46.

In that battle, the ground shone like the dusk with clouds scattered all round, for it was strewn with elephants, horses, chariots and foot-soldiers. Some were killed and others were being killed.

# 47.

Bhargava resuscitated the Asuras killed in the battle with the Vidya of Amrtajivinl and drops of water infused with mantras.

# Rudrasarhhitd

48. The sage Arigiras21 too resuscitated the gods in the battle with the divine herbs frequently brought from the mountain Drona.214

49. Jalandhara saw the gods restored to life again in the battle. He then spoke angrily to Bhargava. Jalandhara said:

50. “The gods have been killed by me. How do they rise up again? The Vidya of Amrtajlvinl* has not been heard by me to exist elsewhere.”

Sanatkumdra said:

51. On hearing these words of the son of the ocean, the delighted Bhargava, the preceptor, replied to Jalandhara. Dhdrgava said:

52. “Angiras is bringing divine herbs from the mountain Drona and enlivening the gods. O dear, know my words to be true.

53. O dear, if you wish for victory listen to my auspicious suggestion. Immediately you shall uproot the mountain Drona with your arms and hurl it into the ocean.”

Sanatkumdra said:

54. Thus addressed by his preceptor Bhargava, the lord of the Asuras, hastened to the lofty mountain.

55. With his powerful arms, the Asura brought the mountain Drona and hurled it immediately into the ocean. There is nothing wonderful and mysterious in regard to the splendour of Siva.

56. The great hero, the son of the ocean, took a vast

213. Brhaspati is called Arigiras. In fact, Angiras, born of the coals from the semen of Prajapati was the father of Bfhaspaii.

214. It is a mythical mountain, abounding in herbs efficacious for restoring the dead to life. It was thrown in the ocean by Jalandhara to prevent the gods using its herbs for the resuscitation of their dead. However, there is a mountain of this name in Kumaon, 16 miles from Ranikhet in the district of Almora. See Bajpai, G E.

Amrtajlvinl was a secret lore that restored the dead to life. This was the exclusive possession of Bhargava (Sukra), the preceptor of the Asuras.

army with him, came to the battle ground and began to kill the gods with various weapons.

57. On seeing the gods being killed Brhaspati went to the mountain Drona. Then he, the object of praise and worship by the gods, did not see the mountain there.

58. On realising that the mountain Drona had been removed by the Asuras, Brhaspati was terrified. He returned and said dejectedly.

Brhaspati said;

59. “O gods, run away, all of you. There is no trace of the great mountain Drona. Certainly it has been destroyed by the Asura, the son of the ocean.

60. Jalandhara is a great Asura. He cannot be conquered since he is born of a part of Siva. He will pound all the gods.

61. His power has been understood by me as he is self-born. O gods, all of you remember the act of offence to Siva perpetrated by Indra.

SaruUkumdra said:

62. On hearing these words uttered by the preceptor of the gods, they abandoned all hopes of victory. They became excessively terrified.

63. All the gods including Indra, struck by the king of the Asuras all round, lost courage and fled in all directions. On seeing the gods routed, Asura, Jalandhara,

64. the son of the ocean, entered Amaravatl with sounds of victory from the conches and drums.

65. When the Asura entered the city, Indra and other gods entered the cavern of the golden mountain Meru and remained there. They had been extremely harassed by the Asuras. O sage, at the same time the Asura appointed

66. Sumbha and other Asuras severally in the places of authority of Indra and others. He then went into the cavern of the golden mountain.

15- It is the mythical capital of Indra’s heaven, situated on the golden mount Meru.

# (The battle of the gods)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. On seeing the Asura coming again, the gods including Indra trembled with fear. They fled together.
2. With Brahma at the head they went to Vaikuntha. All of them including Prajapati eulogised Visnu after bowing down to him.

The gods said:

O Hr$ikeia of long arms, O lord, O slayer of Madhu, O lord of gods, Obeisance to you, O destroyer of all Asuras.
O Visnu, of the form of fish 216 who redeemed the Vedas through king Satyavrata, obeisance to you who sport about in the ocean of Dissolution.
Obeisance to you of the form of Tortoise who bore the mountain Mandara of the gods who were attempting to churn the ocean.
Obeisance to you O holy lord, of the form of Boar. Obeisance to you who hold the earth, the support of people. Obeisance to Visnu.
Obeisance to you, the Dwarf. Obeisance to Visnu the younger brother of Indra, the lord who deceived the king of Asuras in the guise of a Brahmin.
Obeisance to Paraiurama who exterminated the K$attriyas, who rendered help to your mother. Obeisance to you who are angry and inimical to the evil beings.
Obeisance to Rama who delighted the worlds and who set the limits of decent behaviour. Obeisance to you the destroyer of Ravana and the lord of Slta.
Obeisance to you of hidden knowledge; to Krsna the great Atman; the sportive paramour of Radha; Obeisance to him of diverse divine sports.

216 The god's eulogy to Visnu enumerates the various forms of Visnu including his nine incarnations, viz Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Vamana, Parasurama, Rama, Krishna, Buddha and Kalki. But it is not intelligible why it shall omit his Narasimha incarnation. Most probably some lines seem to be missing here.

# 11. Obeisance to the Preceptor of Yoga

Obeisance to you, O lord of Laksmi, of the form of Jaina and Bauddha; to you of hidden body and features and the censurer of the Vedas.

Obeisance to you of the form of Kalki; the destroyer of outcastes. Obeisance to him of infinite power and who establishes good virtue.

# 18. O Thunderbolt of Destruction

O thunderbolt for the destruction of misery etc. of the gods harassed by the Asuras. Obeisance to you lying on the Serpent-bed. Obeisance to the one who has sun and the moon for his eyes.

# 19. O Lord of Lakshmi

O lord of Lakshmi, ocean of mercy, save us who have sought refuge in you. All the gods have been driven out of heaven by Jalandhara.

The reference to the Mlecchas indicates that the author of the Purana was aware of the barbarous tribes who perpetrated heinous atrocities on Indian people.

For details see Dange: the Garuda-legend in “the Legends in the MB.” VifPu represented reclining on Serpent Sea. A vivid picture of Vishnu is depicted on the outer wall of the Daiivatira temple at Deogarh. For this illustration see Agrmwal, Matsya Purana—A Study P. 100.

20. The sun has been dislodged from his post. Similarly the moon and the fire too have been removed. The Serpent-king has been removed from Patala and Dharmaraja has been dispossessed.

21. While men freely move about, the gods do not shine. We have sought refuge in you. Let measures for his annihilation be thought of.

Sanatkumdra said: —

22. On hearing these piteous entreaties of the gods, Vi$nu the slayer of Madhu, the ocean of mercy, spoke in a thundering voice.

Vijnu said:—

23. “O gods, cast off your fear. I shall come to the battle-ground. I shall show my valour to Jalandhara.”

24. Having said this with distressed mind, Visnu the enemy of the Asuras got up quickly. The god Visnu who is favourably disposed to his devotees immediately mounted his vehicle Garuda.

25. On seeing her lord departing along with the gods, Laksmi, the daughter of the ocean, spoke with palms joined in reverence and tears welling up in the eyes.

26. “O lord, O I am your beloved. If I am always devoted to you, storehouse of mercy, how does my brother’s death be at your hands.

Visnu said:

27-28. Since I have been eulogised by the gods I shall go to the battle ground immediately. I can only show my valour to the Asura Jalandhara. He cannot be slain by me because he is a part of Siva. Moreover Brahma has said so. Further, you love him too.”

Sanatkumdra said:

who blazed with Visnu’s splendour, he reached the place where Jalandhara was waiting.

31. Then the Daityas afflicted by the gusts of wind set in motion by the wings in the speedy flight of the younger brother of Aruna (i.e Garuda) were blown here and there like the clouds in the sky tossed about in a stormy whirlwind.

32. Then on seeing the Asuras afflicted by the gusts of wind, Jalandhara rushed against Vi$nu shouting out cries of bravery angrily.

33. In the meantime the delighted gods equipped with a vast army began to fight with their strength increased by the brilliance of Visnu.

34. Seeing the army of the gods present there ready to fight Jalandhara commanded the invincible Asuras thus.

Jalandhara said:

35. O Excellent Asuras, put up a stiff fight with Indra and other gods who are always cowardly though they have a huge army.

36-37. At my bidding let all these come out with their entire army—the Mauryas numbering a hundred thousand, the Dhumras in hundreds, the Asuras and the Kalakeyas in crores and the Kalakas, the Daurhrdas and the Kahkas in lakhs.

38. All of you come out readily equipped with many divisions of the army and different kinds of weapons. Be fearless and free from hesitations.

39. O Sumbha, O Niiumbha, destroy in a trice the insignificant gods who feel nervous in the battle field. You are extremely valorous.

Sanatkumdra said:

40-41. Thus the Asuras clever and efficient in battle, commanded by Jalandhara on the one hand and gods equipped with the four sorts of fighting groups on the other.

ao. Garuda, the vehicle of Vi?nu, is called ArunSnuja, i.e. the younger brother of Aruna the charioteer of the sun.

The verse 31 and the first half of the verse 32 of this chapter are repeated in Ch. 1 7 after the verie No. 7.

Rudrasarhkitd fought one another with maces, arrows, javelins, spears etc. They hit one another with axes and spears.

42. The strong ones hit and struck with different weapons. The heroic gods supported and invigorated by Hr§ike£a roared like lions and discharged sharp arrows.

43. Some fought with arrows of very sharp points; some with pestles and iron clubs and some with axes and spears.

44. Thus the fight between the gods and the Asuras was terrific. It was very fierce frightening the sages and the Siddhas.

# (The fight between Vifnu and Jalandhara)

Sanatkumara said:

1. Then the heroic Asuras hit and struck the gods distressed and terrified, with the spears, axes and clubs.

2. With their bodies cut and pierced by the weapons of the Asuras, the gods including Indra became distressed in mind by fear and they fled from the battle.

3. On seeing the gods fleeing, Visnu hastened to the battle ground seated on his vehicle Garuda.

4. By means of his discus Sudarsana he diffused his splendour all round. He shone with the brilliant lotus in his hand and offered fearlessness to his devotees.

5. Holding the conch, sword, mace and the bow, the heroic deity was very furious. He was efficient in the battle using fierce weapons.

6. He produced the twanging sound from his bow and roared aloud. O sage, all the three worlds were filled with its loud sound.

7. The lord Visnu who was highly infuriated cut off the heads of countless Asuras by means of the arrows discharged from his bow.

8. Then the Asuras afflicted by the gusts of wind set in motion by the wings of Garuda in his speedy flight.

were blown to and fro like the clouds in the sky tossed about in a stormy whirlwind.

# 9.

On seeing the Asuras afflicted by the gusts of wind Jalandhara the great Asura became furious and terrified all the gods.

# 10.

Seeing Visnu suppressing and pounding the Asuras, the lips of the heroic Asura throbbed and he rushed at Visnu to fight with him.

# 11.

The king of Asuras shouted and roared terrifying both the gods and the Asuras. On hearing it, the ears became pierced.

# 12.

The entire universe, filled with the terrible shouts of the Asura Jalandhara, quaked.

# 13.

Then a great battle ensued between Vi$pu and Jalandhara, the ruler of Asuras, both filling up the sky with their arrows.

# 14.

O sage, gods, Asuras, sages and the Siddhas were very much surprised at the terrible mutual clash between the two.

# 15.

Striking with a single arrow, Visnu smote the heart of the Asura. With innumerable arrows he cut off the umbrella, banner, bow and arrows of the demon.

# 16.

Seizing the mace with his hand, the Asura jumped up quickly, hit Garuda on his head and felled him to the ground.

# 17.

The infuriated Asura with throbbing lips hit Visnu in his heart with his sharp spear diffusing its splendour.

# 18.

Visnu laughingly split the mace with his sword. The destroyer of Asuras twanged his bow and split him with sharp arrows.

# 19.

Visnu the infuriated destroyer of the Asuras smote the Asura Jalandhara with a very sharp terrifying arrow.

# 20.

On seeing his arrow coming, the powerful Asura cut it off with another arrow and hit Vi$nu in the chest.

# 21.

The heroic Visiju of long arms split the arrow discharged by the Asura to the size of gingelly seeds and roared.

# Rudrasarhhitd

22. The infuriated great Asura fixed an arrow again to his bow and split the arrow of Visnu.

23. Vasudeva fixed another arrow to his bow for the destruction of the enemy of the gods angrily and roared like a lion.

24. Biting his lips with anger, Jalandhara the powerful king of Asuras split the bow of Visnu with his arrow.

25. The heroic Asura of fierce valour, terrible to the gods, hit Visnu again with very sharp arrows.

26. With his bow split, the lord Visnu, protector of the worlds, hurled his great mace for the destruction of Jalandhara.

27. That mace resembling a blazing flame when hurled by Visnu moved with unerring aim and dashed against his body.

28. Though hit by it, the great haughty Jalandhara did not move even slightly as though he was hit by a flower-garland.

29. Then the infuriated Jalandhara, invincible in war, terrifying to the Asuras hurled a trident, resembling fire, at Visnu.

30. Immediately Visnu remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and cut the trident with his sword Nandaka.

31. When the trident was split, the lord of the Asuras leapt and rushed against Visnu and hit him in the chest with his fist.

32. Without minding the pain in the least, the heroic Visnu hit Jalandhara in the chest with his firm fist.

33. Then both of them equally powerful had a hand to hand fight hitting each other with arms, fists and knees. They filled the earth with reverberating sounds.

34. Fighting with the Asura thus, for a long time, excellent sage, Visnu was surprised. He felt dejected in the heart.

35. Then he the foremost among the magic-wielders assumed a delightful aspect. He addressed the king of Asuras in a thundering voice.

Vishnu said:

36. excellent Asura, you are blessed. You are

880 Sivapurfya invincible in war. Since you are a great lord you are not at all afraid of even great weapons.

37. Many Asuras have been killed by these very same weapons in great battles. The wicked and haughty people have been pierced through their bodies and killed.

38. O great Asura, I am delighted by this fight with you. You are really great. A hero like you has not been seen in the three worlds including the mobile and immobile beings. O lord of Asuras, choose a boon. I am pleased at your valour. I shall give you anything even that which cannot be given, whatever is in your mind.

Sanatkumdra said:

39. On hearing these words of Vi$nu, skilled in magic, the intelligent king of the Asuras replied thus.

Jalandhara said:

40. O Brother-in-law, if you are pleased give me this boon. You stay in my house with all your followers, my sister and myself.

Sanatkumdra said:

41. On hearing these words of the great Asura, lord Visnu, the lord of gods, said distressingly “So be it.”

42. Then Vi?nu came to the city called Jalandhara along with his followers, the gods and lak§ml.

43. Then the Asura Jalandhara returned to his abode and stayed very delightedly in the company of his sister and Vi?nu.

44. Thereafter Jalandhara appointed Asuras in the authoritative posts of the gods. Joyously he returned to the Earth.

45. The son of the ocean confiscated whatever gem or jewel the gods, Gandharvas or Siddhas had hoarded.

46. After appointing the powerful Asura, NiSumbha,

221. The town of the Daitya Jalandhara can be identified with that of the tame name in the East Punjab. It was the capital of Jilandhara Deia in the Uttarapatha. For details see the Kumarikakhanda of Sfcandapurftna.

Rudrasarhhitd 881

In the nether-worlds, the powerful ruler of the Asuras brought Sesa and others to the Earth.

48. Making gods, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Serpents, Raksasas and human beings, the denizens of his capital, he ruled over the three worlds.

49. After making the gods thus subservient to himself, Jalandhara protected them all virtuously, like his own sons.

50. When he was ruling the kingdom virtuously, none in his realm was sick or miserable or lean and emaciated or indigent.

# CHAPTER EIGHTEEN

(The conversation between Ndrada and Jalandhara)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. When the great Asura was ruling over the Earth virtuously, the gods were reduced to be mere slaves, O great sage.

2. The distressed gods mentally sought refuge in Siva the benefactor, lord of gods and of everyone.

3. They eulogised the great lord, the bestower of everything and favourably disposed to his devotees, by means of pleasant words.

4. The great lord, the bestower of all desires to his devotees called Narada and commissioned him with a desire to carry out the task of the gods.

5. Then the celestial sage, the wise devotee of Siva, the goal of the good, went to the gods in the city of the Asuras at the bidding of Siva.

6. On seeing the sage Narada coming, the distressed gods, Indra and others, stood up.

7. After bowing to the sage, Indra and other gods, their anxiety apparently manifest in their faces, offered a seat to Narada.

8. After bowing to Narada the great sage who sat comfortably, the distressed gods, Indra and others spoke to him again.

# 882

The gods said:—

# 9.

O excellent sage, listen to our misery. O merciful one, after listening to it, destroy it quickly. You are powerful and the favourite of Siva.

# 10.

The gods have been routed by the Asura Jalandhara from their abodes and positions of controlling authority. Hence we are miserable and distressed.

# 11.

The hot-rayed sun and the moon have been ousted from their positions. The fire-god and the god of death and guardians of the quarters have been expelled.

# 12.

The gods have been harassed by that powerful Asura. We who have been subjected to great grief now seek refuge in you.

# 13.

The great Asura Jalandhara who has suppressed the gods and who is very powerful has made Visnu subservient to him in the battle.

# 14.

Becoming subservient because of helplessness occasioned by the boon granted to him, Vi$nu who carried out our tasks has now begun to stay in his palace along with LaksmI. O intelligent one, please exert yourself for the destruction of Jalandhara. You have fortunately come to us and you have always been the person who can achieve everything for us.

# 15.

Sanatkumdra said:

# 16.

On hearing these words of the gods, the great sage Narada, the merciful, consoled them and said.

Narada said:

# 17.

O gods, I know that you have been defeated by the king of Asuras, that you are miserable and harassed and have been deposed.

# 18.

There is no doubt in this that I shall carry out your task according to my ability. O gods, since you are in misery I shall be favourable to you.

Sanatkumdra said:

# 19.

After saying so and consoling the gods, the excel-

lent sage went to the assembly chamber of Jalandhara to see the favourite Asura.

# 20.

On seeing the excellent sage, the king Jalandhara stood up and offered him a splendid seat with great devotion.

# 21.

After worshipping him duly the surprised king of the Asuras laughed loudly and spoke to the excellent sage. Jalandhara said:

# 22.

O brahmin, whence do you come from? What did you see here? O sage, what is the aim of your present visit here?

# Sanatkumdra said:

# 23.

On hearing these words of king Jalandhara the delighted great sage Narada replied to him. Narada said:

# 24.

O Jalandhara of great intellect, O lord of Danavas and Daityas, O lord of all the worlds, you are blessed. You alone are the enjoyer of all jewels.

# 25.

O excellent king of Daityas, listen to the purpose for which I have come here. I shall explain it to you.

# 26.

O lord of Daityas, I had been to the summit of Kailasa casually. It is ten thousand Yojanas wide. It has a grove of Kalpa trees.

# 27.

Hundreds of Kamadhenus are found there. It is illuminated by Cintamani gems. It abounds in gold. It is divine and wonderfully brilliant.

# 28.

There I saw Siva seated along with Parvati. He is fair-complexioned and exquisitely handsome. He has three eyes and the moon for his crest.

# 29.

On seeing this wonderfully great thing, a doubt arose in my mind. Can there be anywhere in the three worlds such a splendour as this?

# 30.

O lord of Daityas then the idea of your prosperity struck into my mind. Now I have come to you to see it personally.

# Sanatkumdra said:

# 31.

On hearing these words of Narada the lord of

# Sivapurdna

32. showed Daityas Jalandhara all his glory to Narada. On seeing it, the wise Narada, eager to realise the interests of the gods, spoke to the king of Daityas, Jalandhara, induced by the lord.

Narada said:

# 33.

O foremost among heroes, you have everything conducive to prosperity. You are the lord of the three worlds. What wonder that you possess this wealth.

# 34.

Big jewels, heaps of gems, elephants and other adjuncts to prosperity flourish in your mansion. Whatever valuable thing there is in the worlds finds a place here.

# 35.

O great hero, the most excellent of all elephants, Airavata of Indra has been brought by you. The most excellent of all horses, Uccaihsravas of the sun has been brought by you.

# 36.

The celestial Kalpa tree has been brought by you; the treasures of Kubera and the aerial chariot of Brahma yoked to swan have been brought by you.

# 37.

Thus all excellent things available in heaven, earth and nether worlds, O great Daitya, flourish in your mansion in their entirety. I am highly delighted on seeing your great affluence consisting of diverse objects—elephant, horse etc.

# 38.

But O Jalandhara, your mansion is deficient in the most excellent of all ladies. You deserve to bring that.

# 39.

O Jalandhara, one who possesses all excellent things but does not possess the most excellent of women does not shine. His life is rendered waste.

Sanatkumdra said: On hearing these words of Narada the noble soul, the king of Daityas, with his mind excited by passion, spoke as follows.

# 222.

Uccaibiravas, the horse of the sun, is distinct from that of the same name which was appropriated by Indra after it was produced at the churning of the ocean (ftp. V- U of the next chapter).

Rudrasarhkitd 885

Jalandhara said:

# 42.

“O celestial sage, Narada, obeisance be to you, holy lord. Where is this most excellent of all ladies? Please tell me now.”

# 43.

“Wherever it be in the whole of this universe, if such a lady exists anywhere, I will bring her here. Truth, it is certainly the truth.”

Narada said:

# 44.

Kailasa is very beautiful and it possesses all sorts of things conducive to prosperity. Siva lives there assuming the form of a naked Yogin.

# 45.

His wife Parvati is exquisitely beautiful in every limb. She is charming and has all the characteristics of a beautiful lady.

# 46.

Such an exquisite beauteous form has never been seen anywhere. It incites the enthusiasm of everybody. It is highly wonderful. It fascinates even the Yogins. It is worthy of being seen. It is conducive to great prosperity.

# 47.

This occurs to my mind, O valiant Jalandhara that there is none more prosperous in the three worlds than Siva who possesses the most excellent of all ladies.

# 48.

Even the four-faced lord Brahma, immersed in her ocean of beauty, lost his mental steadiness formerly. Who can be compared to such a beautiful lady?

# 49.

Even Siva reputed to be free from infatuation has been won over by her womanly sports. Siva who is independent has been subjugated by her.

# 50.

The prosperity that he enjoys inasmuch as he indulges in dalliance with the most excellent of all ladies has not come to you O lord of Daityas though you are the master of excellent gems and jewels.

Sanatkumdra said:

# 51.

After saying this, the world-renowned celestial

# CHAPTER NINETEEN

# (Jalandhara’s emissary to Siva)

Vy&#x26;sa said:

1. O omniscient Sanatkumara, what did the king of Daityas do after the departure of Narada to heaven? Please narrate to me in detail.

Sanatkumara said:

2. When Narada departed to heaven after taking leave of the Daitya, the king of Daityas who had heard of the exquisite beauty of Parvatl became harassed with pangs of love.

3. The deluded Daitya, Jalandhara, who had lost clear thinking, being swayed by Time (the annihilator) called his messenger Rahu.

4. The infatuated son of the ocean, Jalandhara, addressed him politely with these words.

Jalandhara said:

5. O Rahu of great intellect, most excellent of my emissaries, go to the mountain Kailasa, O accomplisher of all activities.

6. A sage and a Yogin named Siva lives there. He has matted locks of hair. He is detached. He has controlled his senses. His body is smeared with ashes.

7. O messenger, you shall go there and tell the detached Yogin Siva with matted locks of hair, fearlessly.

8. ‘O Yogin, ocean of mercy, of what avail is an exquisitely beautiful wife to you who stay in the jungle attended by ghosts, goblins, spirits and other beings?

9. O Yogin, this state of affairs is no good in a world with me as the Ruler? Hence you give up your wife, the most excellent lady, to me, the enjoyer of all excellent things.

# Rudrasarhhitd

10. Know that the whole universe including the mobile and immobile beings is under my suzerainty. All the excellent things of the three worlds have come into my possession.

11. I have forcibly seized the most excellent elephant of Indra, the most excellent horse, Uccaihsravas and the celestial tree parijata.

12. The wonderfully excellent and the most divine aerial chariot fitted with the swan, belonging to Brahma is now standing in my court-yard.

13. The divine and excellent treasure Mahapadma etc. of Kubera is in my custody. The umbrella of Varuna stands in my house shedding its golden brilliance.

14. The great garland of never-fading lotuses of fine filaments belonging to my father is as good as mine. The noose of Varuna lord of waters is also mine.

15. The excellent Javelin of Mrtyu has been seized by me with force. The god of fire has surrendered to me two clothes purified in fire.

16. Thus O great Yogin, all excellent things shine in my possession. Hence O ascetic (wearing matted hair) you too surrender your wife the most excellent of all ladies to me. 826

Sanatkumdra said:

17. On hearing his words Rahu went to Kailasa and was allowed to enter by Nandin. With surprise and mystery manifest in his eyes, he went to the assembly chamber of Siva.

18-20. On entering it, he saw Siva, the lord of the gods, the great lord, quelling darkness with his refulgence, shining with ashes smeared (over his body), adorned with all Royal paraphernalia, of wonderful features, exquisite in every limb and embellished with divine ornaments. The emissary named Rahu bowed to Siva. His haughtiness subsided by the brilliance of his body. He went near Siva.

21. Rahu was desirous of speaking to him. He sat in front of Siva. Urged by his gesture Rahu spoke to the three-eyed god Siva.

225. For the similarity of ideas and verbal expression compare verses 10-16 and 22-29 of this chapter with the verses of the Mkp.

Rdhu said :

# 22.

I am the messenger of the lord of the three worlds, worthy of being served for ever by Daityas and serpents. I have come here to you on being sent by him.

# 23.

The son of the ocean Jalandhara became the lord of all Daityas and now he is the lord of the three worlds. He is the emperor of all.

# 24.

That powerful king of Daityas is like the god of death to the gods. Listen to what he says addressing you the Yogin. O bull-bannered god, to the behest of the lord of Daityas who has divine power and who is the master of all excellent things.

# 25.

How can the auspicious daughter of Himavat be a wife unto you who habitually stay in the cremation ground wearing garlands of bones and assuming the form of a naked ascetic.

# 26.

I am the possessor of all excellent things. She is the most excellent of all ladies. She deserves me better than you who live on alms.

# 27.

The three worlds are under my control. I partake of shares in sacrifices. The excellent things of the three worlds are found in my palace.

# 28.

We are the enjoyers of excellent things. You are a mere naked ascetic and a Yogin. Surrender your wife unto me. Subjects shall always keep their king happy.

Sanatkumdra said :

# 29.

When Rahu spoke thus, a terrific being resonant like the thunder came out from the space between the eye-brows of the trident-bearing deity.

# 30.

He had a leonine mouth with a moving tongue; his eyes shed fiery flames; his hair stood at its end; his body was dry and rough. He appeared to be the man-lion incarnation of Visnu.

# 31.

He was huge in size. He had long arms. His calves were as stout and huge as the palmyra tree. He was very terrible. He immediately rushed at Rahu.

# 32.

On seeing him rushing to devour, Rahu was terrified. He ran out when he was caught by the terrible being.

Rdhu said:

34. “O great lord, O lord of the gods, save me who have sought refuge in you. You are always worthy of being worshipped by the gods and Asuras. You are the lord endowed with all riches and accomplishments.

35. O great lord, your terrible servant has come here to swallow me, a brahmin.

36. O lord of gods, favourably disposed to your devotees, save me lest he should devour me. Obeisance be to you again and again.”

Sanatkumdra said:

37. O sage, on hearing the words of the brahmin, the great lord, favourite of the distressed and helpless, spoke to his Gana.

The great lord said:

38. “Leave off this brahmin Rahu, the emissary who has sought refuge. Excellent Gana, those who seek shelter shall be protected, not punished.”

Sanatkumdra said:

39. Commanded thus by the lord of Parvati, of sympathetic temperament, the Gana set Rahu free, immediately on hearing the word brahmin.

40. After leaving off Rahu, the gana came near Siva and pleaded to the great lord in piteous words.

The gana said:

41. O great lord, O lord of the gods, O Siva the merciful, O deity favourable to the devotees, my prey has been taken away.

42. O lord, I am tormented by hunger. So I am utterly emaciated. O lord of the gods, what shall be eaten by me? Please command me, O lord.

Sanatkumdra said:

43. On hearing these words of the being, the great lord of wonderful sports, eager to help his own persons, replied.

The great lord said:—

44. “If you are badly in need of food, if hunger torments you, eat up immediately the flesh of your own hands and feet.”

Sanatkumdra said:

45. On being commanded thus by Siva, the being ate up the flesh from his limbs. He was then left only with his head.

46. On seeing that being of terrible activities, left only with his head, the delighted Sadasiva spoke smilingly. Siva said: —

47. “O great Gana, you are blessed since you carried out my behest to the very letter. O excellent one, I am pleased with this action of yours.

48. You shall hereafter be known by the title Kirtimukha. You shall be my door-keeper. You shall be one of my great Ganas, very heroic and terrible to all wicked persons.

49. You are my favourite. In the course of my worship, you too shall be worshipped always by my devotees. Those who do not worship you cannot be pleasing to me.”

Sanatkumdra said:

50. With this excellent blessing from Siva, he became delighted. From that time onwards Kirtimukha²²⁶ was stationed at the entrance of the lord of the gods.

51. This Gana shall be specially worshipped in the course of the adoration of Siva. Those who do not worship him at the outset will find their worship in vain.

226. Kirtimukha, the great Gana of Siva, represented in sculpture by a trunkless head, is installed beside the door in front of Siva’s image.

# (The fight between the rank and file of the Gam$ and the Asuras)

Vydsa said:

1. O omniscient Sanatkumara, a wonderful story has been narrated by you, wherein the sanctifying sports of Siva the great lord are included.
2. Now take pity on me and tell me with pleasure. O great sage, when released by that being where did Rahu go?

S&#x26;ta said:

On hearing the words of Vyasa of immeasurable intelligence, the great sage, the delighted son of Brahma, replied.

Sanatkumara said:

Rahu had been let off in the land of the outcastes. He too became an outcaste and came to be known in the world as such.
Considering that as his second birth he became humble. He became free from haughtiness. He slowly wended his way to the city of Jalandhara.
After approaching Jalandhara the lord of Daityas, he explained everything concerning Siva in detail, O Vyasa.
On hearing it, the powerful son of the ocean, the excellent lord of Daityas, Jalandhara became furious from head to foot.
Then the infuriated excellent Daitya commanded the entire army of the Daityas to enter into the fray.

Jalandhara said:

Let all the Asuras such as Kalanemi and others set out with their entire divisions; Sumbha, Nisumbha and

11. After ordering thus, the lord of the Asuras the valorous son of the ocean set out quickly accompanied by crores of Daityas.

12. Then Sukra and Rahu with his head severed went ahead of him. In his quick jerky movement, his crown became dislodged and fell on the ground.

13. The sky was entirely enveloped by clouds as in the rainy season. Many ill omens occurred portending great slumber.

14. On seeing his enterprise, the gods including Indra went to Kailasa, the abode of Siva without being observed.

15. After going there and seeing Siva, the gods including Indra, bowed to him with stooping shoulders. They joined their palms in reverence and eulogised.

The gods said:

16. O great lord, lord of the gods, O Siva the merciful, obeisance be to you. Save us who have sought refuge in you.

17. O lord, we are very much distressed by this harassment. All including Indra are deposed and compelled to stay on the earth.

18. O lord, how is it possible that you do not know this adversity of the gods? Hence in order to protect us please kill him.

19. O lord, Vi?nu who was assigned by you the task of protection is now unable to protect us.

20. He is also subservient to him and stays in his mansion along with Lak$ml. All of us gods stay there obeying his behests.

21. O Siva, we have approached you unobserved by him. That powerful son of the ocean is coming hither to fight with you.

22. O omniscient lord, you shall kill Jalandhara in the battle without delay. Save us who have sought refuge in you.

Sanatkumdra said:

23. After saying this, the gods including Indra bowed to him and stood humbly glancing at the feet of lord Siva.

24. On hearing the words of the gods the bull-bannered deity laughed. He called Visnu immediately and spoke these words.

The lord Siva said:

25. O great Visnu, the distressed gods harassed by Jalandhara have sought refuge in me.

26. O Vi$nu, how is it that Jalandhara was not killed in battle by you? Leaving off your own Vaikun^ha you have gone to his mansion?

27. As I wanted to be free and sportful, I had appointed you for the protection of the good and the curbing of the wicked.

Sanatkumdra said:

28. On hearing the words of lord Siva, Visnu replied humbly bowing down with palms joined in reverence,

Visnu said:

29. He was not killed in war by me because he was born of a part of yours. Moreover he is Lak$mi’s brother. Please kill him.

30. O lord of the gods, he is very powerful, heroic and indefatigable by all the heaven-dwellers and others too. I am telling you the truth.

31. In fact a war was fought with him by me in the company of the gods. But my strategy was ineffective in regard to this great Danava.

32. I told him “I am delighted with your valour. Tell me the boon you wish to have”. On hearing these words of mine he chose an excellent boon.

33. “O great Visnu please stay in my mansion subservient to me along with my sister, the gods and myself.” So I went to his mansion.

228. Lakjmi, produced at the churning of the ocean, became the daughter of the ocean. Thus he could be the filter of Jalandhara who was the son of the ocean.

Go back to your abode fearlessly. Let the gods too go back without fear and hesitation, considering the ruler of the Asuras already killed.

On hearing the tumultuous roar of the Daityas, lord Siva of great sports, the destroyer of the wicked, became very furious.

47. With the dead elephants, horses and foot soldiers, the earth shone in the same way as before when great mountains were scattered, smitten by the thunderbolt of Indra.

48. With the groups of Daityas killed by the Pramathas, and with the Ganas killed by the Daityas, the whole ground was filled with suets, flesh and streams of blood. It became so marshy as it became impassable.

49. With the power of Safijivani, Bhargava resuscitated the forces of the Daityas killed by the Pramathas in the battle again and again.

50. On seeing them, all the Ganas were agitated and terrified. They intimated to the lord of the gods what Sukra did.

51. On hearing it, lord Siva became terribly furious. He became terrific blazing the quarters as it were.

52. A terrible Krtya came out of Rudra’s mouth. Her calves were as stout as Palmyra trees. Her mouth was huge and deep like mountain caverns. With her breasts she crushed huge trees.

53. O excellent sage, she rushed immediately to the battle ground. The terrible Krtya roamed the battle-ground devouring the great Asuras.

54. Fearlessly she rushed amid the battle-field where Bhargava was stationed surrounded by the leading Daityas.

55. O sage, she enveloped the whole sky with her terrible brilliance. She split the ground she trod; she stuffed Bhargava into her vaginal passage and vanished in the sky.

56. On seeing Bhargava seized, the invincible armies of the Daityas became dejected and faded in their faces. They fled from the battle ground.

57. The army of the Daityas split in their terrific fear of the Ganas like bundles of grass split and scattered when blown by the wind.

58. On seeing the army of the Daityas thus dispersed and frightened of the Ganas, the leaders Sumbha and Nimbha and Kalanemi became infuriated.

59. —All the three powerful Daityas obstructed the

896 Sivdputdnd army of the Ganas showering arrows like the destructive clouds in the rainy season.

60. The volleys of arrows discharged by the Daityas enveloped all the quarters and the atmosphere like huge swarms of locusts. They shook the hosts of Ganas.

61. Split by hundreds of arrows, the Ganas shed streams of blood. They resembled the red Kimsuka flowers of the spring season. They did not know what to do.

62. On seeing their army thus shattered, the infuriated leaders Nandin, Ganesa and Karttikeya hurriedly checked the rushing Daityas.

# CHAPTER TWENTYONE

# (Description of the Special War)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. On seeing the leaders of the Ganas, Nandin, Ganesa and Karttikeya, the Danavas rushed at them for a duel combat.

2. Kalanemi clashed with Nandin; Sumbha fought Ganesa and Nisumbha hesitatingly rushed at Karttikeya.

3. With five arrows Nisumbha hit the peacock of Karttikeya in the chest and it fell unconscious.

4. Then the infuriated Karttikeya discharged five arrows at his chariot and pierced the horses and the charioteer.

5. The invincible hero hit Nisumbha with another sharp arrow quickly and roared.

6. The Asura Nisumbha of great prowess and heroism hit Karttikeya in the battle with his arrow as he roared.

7. By the time the furious Karttikeya seized his spear, Nisumbha struck him with it.

8. Thus, O Vyasa, a great fight between Karttikeya and Nisumbha ensued as they shouted heroically.

9. Then Nandin hit Kalanemi with seven arrows and pierced his horses, banner, chariot and charioteer.

# Rudrasarhhita

10. With very sharp shafts discharged from his bow, the infuriated Kalanemi cut the bow of Nandin.

11. Defying the great demon Kalanemi the heroic Nandlivara hit him in the chest with his spear.

12. With his horses and charioteer killed and himself wounded in the chest, he broke the top of a mountain and hit Nandin.

13. Then Sumbha and Ganesa seated respectively in a chariot and on a mouse fought each other with volleys of arrows.

14. Ganesa hit Sumbha in his chest with an arrow and felled his charioteer with three arrows on the ground.

15. Then the infuriated Sumbha covered Ganesa with a shower of arrows. Hitting the mouse with three arrows he roared like thunder.

16. The mouse pierced by the arrows, shook with acute pain. Ganesa was thrown off (his vehicle) and he became a foot soldier (as it were).

17. Then Ganesa hit Sumbha in his chest with his axe and felled him to the ground. Thereafter he mounted his mouse again.

18. Lord Ganesa of elephantine face got ready for the fight. He hit him mockingly and angrily as if hitting a great elephant with a goad.

19. Kalanemi and Sumbha simultaneously attacked Ganesa furiously with arrows as ruthless as serpents.

20. On seeing him afflicted, the powerful Virabhadra accompanied by a crore goblins rushed in.

21. The Kusmandas, Bhairavas, Vetalas, Yoginis, PiSacas, Dakinis and Ganas came there with him.

22. The Earth, resonant with various kinds of noise, shouts of joy, leonine roars and the sounds of Damarukas, quaked.

23. Then the Bhutas ran here and there devouring the Danavas. They jumped up and danced in the battle field and threw the Asura on the ground.

24. In the meantime, O Vyasa, Nandin and Guha regained their consciousness and got up. They roared in the battlefield again.

25. Nandin and Karttikeya came hurriedly and struck.

the Daityas in the battle ground with incessant volleys of arrows.

26. Then the army of the Daityas became agitated and dejected with many Daityas wounded, split, killed, felled to the ground and devoured.

27. Thus Nandin, Karttikeya the formidable and valorous, Virabhadra and the other Ganas roared much in the battle.

28. Then those two generals of the son of the ocean, Niumbha and Sumbha, the great Daitya Kalanemi and the other Asuras were defeated.

29. On seeing the army destroyed, the powerful son of the ocean rushed at the Ganas in his chariot of waving and wafting colours.

30. Thereat even the defeated Daityas became jubilant. O Vyasa, they roared much and got ready for the fray.

31. The victorious Ganas of Siva too roared, led by Nandin, Karttikeya, Ganesa and Virabhadara, O sage.

32. The trumpets of the elephants, the neighing of the horses, the rumbling of the chariots, the sounds of the conches and war-drums and the leonine roars of the armies rose up.

33. The space between heaven and the earth became enveloped by the many arrows discharged by Jalandhara as if by floating masses of mist.

34. Hitting Nandin and Ganesa with five arrows each and Virabhadra with twenty he roared like thunder.

35. Karttikeya the heroic son of Siva then swiftly hit the Daitya Jalandhara with his spear and roared.

36. With the body pierced through by the spear, the Daitya fell on the ground with eyes rolling. But the powerful Asura swiftly stood up.

37. Then Jalandhara the infuriated leader of the Daityas hit Karttikeya in his chest with his mace.

38. O Vyasa, plainly exhibiting the successful efficiency of the Mace secured as a favour from Brahma, Karttikeya fell on the ground suddenly.

39. Similarly, struck by the mace Nandin too fell on the ground.

# 40.

Then the infuriated hero Ganesa came there after remembering the lotus like feet of Siva and split the mace of the Daitya with his axe.

# 41.

Virabhadra then hit the Danava in his chest with three arrows. He cut off the banner, umbrella, bow and the horses of the Daitya with seven arrows.

# 42.

Then the infuriated leader of the Daityas lifted up his terrible Sakti and felled Ganesa. He mounted another chariot then.

# 43.

The powerful leader of the Daityas did not mind Virabhadra at all. Angrily he rushed at him.

# 44.

Jalandhara, the heroic king of Daityas, hit Virabhadra with a fierce arrow and roared.

# 45.

The infuriated Virabhadra split that arrow with a sharp-edged arrow. With another great arrow he hit him too.

# 46.

Then both of them, the most excellent of heroes refulgent like the sun, fought each other with different kinds of weapons and missiles.

# 47.

Virabhadra then felled his horses with his arrows. He forcefully cut off him bow and flags too.

# 48.

Then the king of the Daityas leapt up to him with a great iron club. That powerful warrior reached very near Virabhadra very quickly.

# 49.

The heroic and powerful son of the ocean hit Virabhadra on his head with his great iron club. He then roared.

# 50.

Virabhadra, the leader of the Ganas, fell on the ground with his head shattered by the iron club and shed much blood.

# 51.

On seeing Virabhadra fallen, the terrified Ganas abandoned the battle ground shrieking and fled to lord Siva.

# 52.

On hearing the tumultuous uproar of the Ganas, the moon-crested lord asked the excellent Ganas, the heroes standing near him.

# 53.

Siva said: How is this tumultuous uproar among my Ganas?



---


O heroes, let this be enquired into. Peace shall be established by me, of course.

54. Even as the lord of the gods was conducting the enquiry, the leaders of the Ganas approached the lord.

55. On seeing them dejected, the lord enquired after their health. The Ganas then intimated to him everything in detail.

56. On hearing it, lord Siva, the expert in divine sports assured them of freedom from fear increasing their enthusiasm.

# CHAPTER TWENTYTWO

# (Description of Jalandhara’s Battle)

Sanatkumdra said: —

1. Then the great lord Siva assuming a terrible form went laughingly to the battle-field and sat on his bull, accompanied by his heroic Ganas.

2. On seeing Siva coming, the Ganas who were formerly defeated returned to fight roaring like lions.

3. Other Ganas too shouted heroically and jubilantly. Well-equipped with their weapons they killed the Daityas with showers of arrows.

4. On seeing Siva the terrible, all the Daityas fled for fear from the battle field as the sins on seeing a devotee of Siva.

5. On seeing the Daityas returning from the battle field, Jalandhara rushed at Siva discharging thousands of arrows.

6. Thousands of leading Daityas, NKumbha, Sumbha and others rushed at Siva, biting their lips.

7. Similarly Kalanemi the hero, Khadgaroma, Balahaka, Ghasmara, Pracanda and others rushed at Siva.

8. O sage, the heroes Sumbha and others, covered the Ganas of Rudra with arrows and cut their limbs.

9. On seeing his army of Ganas enveloped in darkness

# Rudrasarhhitd

by the vollevs of arrows, Siva split the net of their arrows and encompassed the sky with his own.

10. He afflicted the Daityas with the gusts of wind raised by the arrows. He felled them to the ground with fierce volleys of arrows.

11. He severed the head of Khadgaroma from his body with his axe. He shattered the head of Balahaka with his club into two pieces.

12. He tied the Daitya Ghasmara with his noose and dashed him on the ground. With his trident, he chopped off the great hero Pracan^a.

13. Some of the Asuras were killed by the bull. Some were struck by the arrows. Like elephants harassed by lions, the Asuras were unable to stay there.

14. Then the great Asura Jalandhara became infuriated and rebuked the Daityas in the battle. The courageous Daitya mocked at Sumbha and others and spoke thus.

Jalandhara said:

15. Of what avail is your boasting about the pedigree of your mother if you flee back on being attacked? To die cowardly while you profess to be heroes is not commendable, nor does it yield heaven. You have faith in war or the trivial fellows, if essential strength in the heart or if you have no lurking pleasures for sexual indulgence then you come forward and stand before me.

16. Death in battle is preferable. It yields all cherished desires. It is especially conducive to fame. It has been proclaimed as the bestower of salvation too.

17. The wandering recluse of supreme knowledge and wisdom as well as he who dies fighting face to face, attain the greatest region after breaking through the solar sphere.

18. No sensible man should ever be afraid of death. Death is inevitable notwithstanding all the remedies employed to ward it off.

19. O heroes, death is congenital to any being born. Either today or at the end of a hundred years all living beings are sure to die.

# Sivapurdna

21. Hence, cast off all fear for death. Come and fight in war joyously. In every respect there is certainly a great bliss here and hereafter.

Sanatkumara said:

22. Saying this, he tried to encourage his heroes in several ways. But the frightened demons did not regain courage. They fled from the battle in a trice.

23. On seeing his army on the rout, the heroic son of the ocean Jalandhara became very furious.

24. Then the infuriated Jalandhara challenged for a battle in a stentorian voice like the sound of fierce thunderbolt.

Jalandhara said:

25. O ascetic, fight with me now. What is the use of slaying these? Show me what little strength you have.

Sanatkumara said:

26. After saying this, Jalandhara the great Daitya hit the bull-bannered Siva of indefatigable endeavour, with an incessant volley of arrows.

27. Laughingly, lord Siva split all the arrows of Jalandhara by discharging his own sharp arrows even before his arrows reached him.

28. Then with seven arrows he split the horses, banner, umbrella and the bow of Daitya Jalandhara. O sage, it is not surprising in the case of Siva.

29. The infuriated Asura the son of the ocean, devoid of a chariot and with bow split up rushed at Siva lifting his mace vigorously.

30. O Vyasa, lord Siva of great sports immediately split asunder the mace hurled by him, by means of his arrows.

31. Yet the highly infuriated great Asura rushed at Siva with the mailed fist lifted up, with a desire to kill him.

32. By a volley of arrows Jalandhara was hurled back a KroSa by Siva of indefatigable enterprise.

33. Then, considering Siva more powerful, Jalandhara

# RudrasarhhitA

the Daitya, created the illusion of Gandharvas that mysteriously fascinated even Siva.

34. By the power of his Maya, hosts of Gandharvas and celestial damsels came into view for fascinating Siva.

35. The Gandharvas and celestial damsels sang and danced. Others played on flutes, mrdangas and cymbals.

36. On seeing that wonderful feat, Siva was fascinated by the Ganas. He was not conscious of even the garments let down from the hands.

37. On seeing Siva concentrated in the dance Jalandhara urged by lust immediately went to the place where Gaurl stood.

38-39. He entrusted the powerful Sumbha and NiSumbha with the conduct of war. With his demonaic Maya he assumed the form of Siva —with ten brawny arms, five faces, three eyes, and matted hair. He was seated on the great bull. In every respect, O Vyasa, Jalandhara appeared like Siva.

40. On seeing Siva coming, the beloved of Siva came out from the midst of her female friends within the range of his vision.

41. When the lord of Asuras saw the bauntiful Parvati, he let drops of semen fall and his limbs became benumbed.

42. On realising that he was the demon, the terrified Gaurl vanished immediately to the northern shore of the Manasa lake.

43. Unable to see her who disappeared in a moment like lightning, the Daitya immediately went to the place where lord Siva stood in order to fight him.

44. Parvati remembered lord Visnu mentally. Immediately she saw the lord seated near her.

45. On seeing Vi$nu bowing to her with palms joined in reverence, Parvati the beloved of Siva, the mother of the universe, spoke delightedly.

Parvati said:

46. O Vi?nu, is it not known to you that the wicked Daitya Jalandhara perpetrated a wonderfully base deed?

47. On hearing the words of the mother of the



---


universe, the Garuda-bannered lord bowed to Parvati bending his neck and joining his palms in reverence and spoke. Vifnu said:

1. O mother, by your favour that incident is known to me. What you shall be pleased to commend I shall perform with your permission.

Sanatkumara said:

On hearing the words of Visnu, Parvati said again. The mother of the universe desired to teach Vi?nu the policy based on Dharma.

Parvati said:

He himself has shown the path. Know that to be the way in the same manner. At my bidding, make the chastity of his wife violated.
O Visnu, that great Daitya cannot be killed otherwise. In the earth there is no other virtue equal to chastity.

Sanatkumara said:

On hearing this command and accepting it with lowered head, Visnu immediately went to the city of Jalandhara for practising deception.

# CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE

(Outraging the modesty of Vpidd)

Vydsa said:

O omniscient Sanatkumara, please narrate, O eloquent one, what did Vi?nu do there? How did she err from her virtue?

Sanatkumdra said:

After going to the city of Jalandhara, Vi*nu thought of violating the chastity of Vpida.

# 3.

The foremost among those who wield illusion, he assumed a wonderful body and stationed himself in a park of the city. He made Vrnda see a dream.

# 4.

The gentle lady Vrnda, the wife of Jalandhara, though of pure rites, had a very bad dream at night on account of Viṣṇu’s power of illusion.

# 5.

In the dream as a result of Viṣṇu’s power of illusion she saw the naked form of her husband anointed with oil and seated on a buffalo.

# 6.

He was proceeding in the southern direction. His head had been completely shaved. He was wearing black flowers to decorate himself. He was being served by a number of Asuras. He was completely encompassed by darkness.

# 7.

Later, towards the end of the night she had various bad dreams, such as the whole city was submerged in the sea, all of a sudden, along with herself.

# 8.

Then the lady woke up still thinking of the dream she had had. She saw the rising sun with a hole in the middle and fading repeatedly.

# 9.

On realising that it was a bad portent, the terrified lady began to cry. She did not feel happy at all in the spacious terraces and towers of the palace.

# 10.

With two of her friends she then went to the park in the city. Even there she did not find herself at ease.

# 11.

Then she, the dejected gloomy wife of Jalandhara, wandered from forest to forest. She was not conscious of even herself.

# 12.

The wandering lady saw two demons of terrible leonine faces with shining curved fanglike teeth.

# 13.

Terrified much on seeing them, the lady fled from there and saw an ascetic of calm countenance observing silence and accompanied by his disciple.

# 14.

Putting her tender hands round his neck due to fright she gasped out “O sage, save me. I have sought refuge in you.”

# 15.

Seeing the agitated lady followed by the demons the sage drove them back with a loud bellowing sound of “Hum”.

# 16.

O sage, seeing them routed and terrified by the...

# SivapurS^a

mere Humkara, the wife of the king of Daityas was struck with a great wonder in her heart.

17. Freed from the fear she bowed down to the great sage with palms joined in reverence and prostrated herself in front of him. Vrnda then spoke.

Vrnda said:

18. “O leader of sages, O ocean of mercy, O remover of harassment from others, I have been saved by you from this terrible danger from the wicked demons.

19. You are competent in every respect. You are omniscient. Yet I wish to submit something. Be pleased to hear it. O Jalandhara my husband has gone to fight lord, Siva. O holy one of good rites, how does he fare in the war? Please tell me,”

Sanalkumdra said:

21. On hearing her words, the sage feigned a deceptive silence. Fully aware of the means of achieving his selfish ends he looked up sympathetically.

22. In the meantime two lordly monkeys came there and stood bowing down in front of him. At a significant gesture from his eyebrows, the monkeys rose into the sky again.

23. O great sage, within a trice, they came back taking with them his head, body and limbs and stood in front of the sage.

24. On seeing the head, body and limbs of her husband, Vrnda fell unconscious, extremely pained at the misery of her lord.

Vrndd said:

25. “O lord, formerly you used to humour me with pleasant chats. How is it that, you do not speak to me now, to your pious beloved?

26. How is it that you, by whom all the gods including the Gandharvas and Vi$nu had been defeated, you who had conquered the three worlds, have now been killed by a poor sage?

# RudrasarhhiiA

27. O excellent Daitya, you did not know the reality of Siva nor did you pay heed to my words ‘Siva is Supreme Brahman.*

28. Having served you I found that it was not due to haughtiness but due to your association with bad men that you did all this.

29. Saying these and other words of lamentation, his beloved wife strictly adhering to virtue, cried in diverse ways with a pained heart.

30. Then steadying herself a little, and heaving deep sighs of grief she bowed to the excellent sage with palms joined in reverence.

31. “O excellent sage, storehouse of mercy, eager to help others, O gentle sir, take pity on me and resuscitate my lord. O great sage, I know you are competent to enliven him again. Hence please resuscitate my beloved husband.”

Sanatkumara said:

33. After saying this, the chaste wife of the Daitya fell at his feet heaving sighs of grief.

The sage said:

34. This Daitya cannot be enlivened because he has been killed by Siva in the battle. Those killed in battle by Siva never return to life.

35. Still, knowing the eternal Dharma that those who seek refuge should be protected, I shall resuscitate him urged by pity.

Sanatkumara said:

36. After saying this and restoring him to life, O sage, that sage who was Visnu the foremost among those who wield illusion vanished from the scene.

37. Jalandhara thus revived to life by him stood up. Delighted in mind he embraced Vrnda and kissed her face.

38. On seeing her husband, Vpida too was delighted. She forgot her sorrow. She considered everything a dream.

39. Delighted in the heart and with all the dormant...

passions kindled up, she sported with him for many days in the middle of that forest.

# 40.

Once at the end of the sexual intercourse she realised that it was Visnu. Vrnda rebuked him angrily and spoke thus.

# Vrnda said:

# 41.

Fie on this misdeed of Vijnu in outraging the modesty of another man’s wife. I have now realised you as the wielder of illusion, appearing in the guise of an ascetic.

# Sanatkumdra said:

# 42.

O Vyasa, saying thus in great anger she showed her brilliant powers as a staunch chaste lady by cursing Vijnu.

# 43.

“O base foe of the Daityas, defiler of other people’s virtue, O wicked one, take this curse from me, greater in force than all persons.

# 44.

The two persons whom you made to appear in front of me shall become Raksasas and abduct your wife.

# 45.

You will be distressed on account of separation from your wife roaming about with Sesa ‘lord of snakes’ who posed as your disciple here. You will seek the help of monkeys in the forest.

# 46.

After saying this, Vrnda entered fire though prevented by Visnu who was fascinated by her charms.

# 47.

O sage, then Brahma and other gods, gathered in the sky accompanied by their wives in order to see the salvation of Vrnda.

# 48.

Then the great brilliance of the wife of Jalandhara immediately went to Sivaloka even as the gods stood watching.

# 49.

The refulgence of Vrnda became merged in Parvati. There was a great shout of “Victory” in the rows of the gods standing in the sky.

aaq. The two Riksasas referred to here were Mirlca and R&#x26;vana who abducted Sita, wife of Rama, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu.

130. The monkeys referred to here were Sugriva, Hanumfin, Nairn Nil* and others.

331. The expression 'lord of snakes' signifies Lakpunana, said to be the incarnation of Sega.

Rudrasarfihita 909

50. O sage, thus the great queen Vrnda the excellent daughter of Kalanemi attained great salvation, thanks to the power of her chastity.

51. Viṣṇu thought of Vrnda remorsefully. The smoke dust from her funeral pyre covered his face. He stood there itself without any peace of mind though urged and consoled by hosts of gods and Siddhas.

# CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR

# (Jalandhara is slain)

1. O excellent son of Brahma, O intelligent one, you have narrated a wonderful story. What happened thereafter in the battle? How was the Asura killed? Please narrate.

Sanatkumāra said:

2. Unable to see Parvati, the king of Daityas returned to the battle ground. The groups of deceptive Gandharvas vanished. It was only then that the bull-bannered deity regained awareness of the surroundings.

3. On seeing the illusion vanished, Siva woke up. Following the way of the world, the annihilator became very furious.

4. Then Siva was a bit surprised in the mind. He approached Jalandhara angrily in order to fight with him. On seeing Siva approaching again, the Asura showered him with arrows.

5. Lord Siva immediately split the cluster of arrows discharged by the powerful Jalandhara by means of his own excellent arrows. This was not surprising for the annihilator of the three worlds.

6. Seeing Siva exhibiting wonderful feats of valour, Jalandhara created Parvati by means of his illusion in order to delude Siva.

7. Siva saw Parvati tied to the chariot and crying.



---


1. She was being harrassed by Nisumbha, Sumbha and other Daityas.

8. On seeing that in her plight, Siva became dispirited and dejected in the mind like an ordinary man pursuing the way of the world.

9. He, an expert in various kinds of sports, remained silent with face drooping down, utterly dejected, exhausted and forgetful of his own prowess.

10. Then Jalandhara hurriedly hit Siva in his chest, belly and the head with three arrows that went deep down as far as their feathered tail.

11. Then within a trice, lord Siva, the principle of perfect wisdom, expert in great sports, assumed a terrific form, dreadfully blazing.

12. On seeing his excessively terrible form, the Daityas fled to the ten different quarters. They were unable to stay facing him.

13. O great sage, even Sumbha and Nisumbha who were renowned for their prowess could not stand in the battle ground.

14. The illusion created by Jalandhara had vanished in an instant. In that all out battle there was great hue and cry.

15. On seeing Sumbha and Nisumbha fleeing, the infuriated Siva rebuked them and cursed as follows. Siva said:

16. “You are wicked and excessively roguish. You have offended me by harassing Parvati. Now both of you have deserted the battle ground.

17. A person fleeing the battle ground shall not be killed. So I do not kill you. Since you have escaped from a fight with me you would be killed by Parvati.”32

18. Even as Siva was saying, Jalandhara, son of the ocean, became very furious with Siva like the blazing fire.

19. One after the other, he showered many sharp.

23a. As cursed by Siva, the Asuras Sumbha and Nrtumbha were killed by Parvati later on. For the detailed description of their destruction, see Markandeya P.

arrows on Siva in the battle. The whole of the Earth became enveloped in darkness by his arrows.

20. Siva split the arrows swiftly, the powerful Daitya hit the bull with an iron club.

21. Due to that blow the bull turned away from the battle field. Even when dragged by Siva it did not stand there.

22. Then the great Siva put forth an unbearable splendour visible to all in the battle field. O great sage, this is true.

23. Then the infuriated Siva assuming a terrible form, became as dreadful as the fire of dissolution, all of a sudden.

24. On seeing the Daitya standing in front like the lofty peak of Meru and hearing from others that he could not be killed, he stood ready for it.

25. As desired by Brahma, the lord protector of the worlds decided to kill Jalandhara, blessing him in the heart of his heart.

26. Becoming excessively angry, the trident bearing deity made a mysteriously terrible wheel in the great waters by means of his big toe indulging in a divine sport.

27. Creating a sharp wheel in the waters of the ocean and remembering that the three worlds had been harassed by Jalandhara, the lord Siva who had slain Daksa, Andhaka Antaka and destroyed the three cities and the sacrifice of Daksa² * 2 and annihilated the three worlds said laughingly. Siva said: O Jalandhara, you are powerful enough to lift the wheel created by me with the leg in the great waters, you will be competent to stand and fight with me, not otherwise.

Sanatkumara said:

29. On hearing his words the Daitya’s eyes gleamed fiercely with anger. He looked at Siva as if burning him with his eyes and said: —

SivafmrSvd Jalandhara said:

# 30-31.

After uplifting the wheel, I shall be killing you with your Ganas. Like Garu^a killing the serpents I shall kill all the people in the world along with the gods. I can destroy the mobile and immobile along with Indra. O lord Siva, who is there in the three worlds that can escape being pierced by my arrows?

# 32.

Even in my childhood, lord Brahma had been defeated by my vigour. That powerful Brahma is in my abode now along with the sages and leading gods.

# 33.

Within a trice, the entire universe of the mobile and immobile has been burnt by me. O Siva, what can be done by you or by your penance? Even lord Brahma has been defeated.

# 34.

Indra, Agni, Yama, Kubera, Vayu, and Varuna and others were unable to endure my valour like the serpents unable to bear even the odour of the lord of birds.

# 35.

O Siva, I have never been obstructed either in the heaven or on the earth. I have gone over all the mountains and crushed all the leading Ganas.

# 36.

To remove the itching sensation in my arms I have hit the lofty mountain Mandara, the glorious mountain Nila and the lustrous mountain Meru.

# 37.

Just for the sport the river Ganga was checked by me on the Himalaya mountain. Even my servants were victorious over the gods, my enemies.

# 38.

I seized the submarine fire and closed its mouth when the entire ocean became one single unit instantaneously.

# 39.

Airavata and other elephants have been hurled into the ocean. Lord Indra along with his chariot has been thrown by me a hundred Yojanas away.

# 40.

The submarine fire (Baqiavt) is a flame with the head of a horse that consumes the water of the rivers falling into the ocean. When it is incapacitated, the water overflows the shore and drowns the universe. The entire units of creation are then drawn together and remain invisible in the ocean.

41. O Siva, you do not know me the conqueror of the three worlds, Jalandhara, the great Daitya and the powerful son of the ocean.

Sanatkumdra said:

42. After saying this to lord Siva, the son of the ocean did not move nor did he remember the Danavas killed in the battle.

43. Lord Siva was slighted and insulted by means of harsh words by the haughty impudent Daitya after slapping each arm by the other forcibly.

44. On hearing the inauspicious words of the Daitya, lord Siva laughed mockingly and became furious.

45. Siva held in his hand the wheel Sudar£ana which he had made with his toe and got ready to kill him.

46. Lord Siva hurled the discus Sudar€ana which resembled a crore suns and the fire of dissolution.

47. Blazing the heaven and the earth, the discus hit Jalandhara and severed his head with wide gaping eyes.

48. The body of the son of the ocean fell on the ground from the chariot making the earth resonant. The head too fell. There was a great hue and cry.

49. His body fell in two halves like the mountain of collyrium split by the thunderbolt and hurled in the ocean.

50. The whole universe was filled with his terrible blood O great sage, the entire earth became deformed.

51. His entire blood and flesh, at the bidding of Siva was taken to the hell Maharaurava and became a big pit of blood there.

52. His splendour that came out of his body merged into Siva just like the splendour that came out of the body of Vrnda and merged into Parvati.

53. On seeing Jalandhara killed, the gods, the Gandharvas and the serpents became highly delighted and said “Well done, O lord”.

54. The gods, Siddhas and great sages were delighted. Making showers of flowers they sang his glory loudly.

236. Maharaurava is one of the many hells to which the souls of the wicked are sent. But as Jalandhara had emanated from Rudra, his soul was merged into Rudra's soul but his flesh and blood went to Maharaurava and were turned into a pool of blood.

55. The celestial damsels excited by love and joy danced. In the company of Kinnaras they sang in harmonious sweet voice.

56. O sage, the quarters became clear when Vrnda’s husband was killed. The three winds, gentle to the touch and sanctifying, blew.

57. The moon became cool. The sun blazed brilliantly. The fires blazed quietly. The sky became clear.

58. O sage, thus the entire universe of the three worlds regained their earlier health and normalcy much when the son of the ocean was killed by Siva of infinite forms.

# CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE

# (Prayer by the gods)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. Then Brahma, other gods and the sages eulogised lord Siva humbly by means of pleasing words.

The gods said:

2. O great lord, lord of the gods favourably disposed to those who seek refuge, you always bestow happiness upon the saintly men and quell the misery of your devotees.

3. O lord, you exhibit wonderfully good divine sports and are available by devotion. You are incapable of being attained or propitiated by the evil-minded. Be favourable to us always.

4. Even the Veda does not know your greatness in reality. Noble men sing your great glory to the extent of their intellect.

5. Indra and others sing your secret greatness always with pleasure and sanctify their own tongue.

Indra is called “the thousand-faced”. In fact he is ‘the thousand-eyed God’. According to the Puranic tradition, Indra seduced Ahalya the wife of the sage Gautama, whereupon the sage cursed him to bear on his body a thousand marks resembling the female organ which were afterwards changed to eyes. He is therefore called Sahasraksa ‘the thousand-eyed’.

33. The great lord Siva heard the auspicious prayer of the gods, conferred boons on them and then vanished immediately from the scene.

36. This prayer of the gods is holy and destructive of sins. It bestows happiness on the devotees and is delightful to Siva.

# (The Vanishing of Vijnu's delusion)

Vijnu said:

1. O son of Brahma, obeisance be to you. O excellent devotee of Siva, you are blessed, since you have narrated this highly divine and auspicious story of Siva.

2. O sage, now narrate lovingly the story of Vijjiu. After enchanting Vrnda what did he do? Where did he go?

# Sanatkumdra said:

3. O Vyasa, listen. O intelligent excellent devotee of Siva, listen to the good story of Visnu mingled with the story of Siva.

4. When Brahma and other gods became silent, lord Siva, favourably disposed to those who seek refuge in him, was delighted and said.

# Siva said:

5. O Brahma, O ye excellent gods, it is for you that Jalandhara has been killed by me although he was a part of myself. Truth. It is the truth that I say.

6. O dear gods, tell me the truth. Have or have not you attained happiness? It is for you that I indulge in sports though I am always free from all aberrations.

# Sanatkumdra said:

7. Then Brahma and other gods, with eyes blooming with delight, bowed to Siva with bent heads and mentioned to him the activities of Visnu.

# The gods said:

8. “O great lord, all the gods have been saved by you from the danger of the enemy but another event has happened. What shall we do in that respect?

9. O lord, Vrnda was fascinated by Visnu. She burnt herself on the pyre and attained the great goal.

10. But Vi$nu deluded by your illusion is excessively agitated by the beauty of Vrnda. He has smeared himself with the ashes from her pyre.

11. Although advised and consoled by the Siddhas and sages, and pacified by us with respect, Visnu deluded by your illusion does not come to his former self.

12. O lord Siva, be pleased. Restore Vi$£u to his former self. This entire creation born of Prakrti and consisting of the mobile and immobile beings, is subservient to you.”

Sanatkumdra said:

Lord Siva said:

# 14.

O Brahma, O gods, you listen to my words attentively. My illusion deludes all the worlds. It cannot be transgressed.

# 15.

The entire universe including gods and human beings is subservient to it. Vi$nu too was deluded by that illusion and became a prey to the lustful love.

# 16.

That illusion is given various names: Uma, MahadevI, the mother of the three deities, the greatest, primordial Mulaprakrti and the lovely woman Parvati.

# 17.

O gods, seek refuge in that fascinating goddess named illusion, for the removal of Visnu’s delusion. She is the bestower of cherished desires and worthy of being sought refuge in.

# 18.

Sing the eulogy that satisfies my Sakti. If she is delighted, she will carry out your tasks.

Sanatkumdra said:

# 19.

O Vyasa, after saying this to the gods, the five-faced lord Siva vanished suddenly along with his Ganas.

# 20.

At the bidding of Siva, Brahma and other gods including Indra mentally eulogised to the primordial Prakrti favourably disposed to her devotees.

The gods said:

# 21.

We bow to the primordial Prakrti from which emanate the three attributes Sattva, Rajas and Tamas that cause creation, sustenance and annihilation, and by whose desire the universe is evolved and dissolved.

920 Sivafwrdna in the universe. We bow to the primordial Prakjti whose forms and activities are not known to the three worlds.

23. We bow to the primordial Prakfti favourably disposed to the devotees. Persons endowed with devotion to her are not bedevilled by poverty, delusion and destruction.

24. O great goddess, please carry out our tasks. O Parvati, please remove the delusion of Visnu. O goddess Durga, obeisance be to you.

25-26. O Siva, when the fight between Jalandhara and Siva started, for killing Jalandhara, Vrnda was deluded by Visnu at the bidding of Gauri. She was made to forsake her virtue and reduced to ashes in the fire. She attained salvation.

27. Jalandhara was slain in the battle by Siva who took pity on us and who always blesses his devotees. We have been relieved from his fear.

28. It is at his bidding that we all have sought refuge in you. You and Siva, O goddess, are always engaged in uplifting your devotees.

29. Infatuated by the beauty of Vj-nda, Vi?nu is staying there itself. He has lost his balance. He is deluded. He has smeared himself with the ashes from her pyre.

30. O great goddess deluded by your illusion, Visnu does not come to his own though advised and consoled by the gods and Siddhas.

31. O great goddess, be merciful. Enlighten Visnu so that he shall return to his region and carry out the task of the gods with a settled mind.

32. Eulogising thus, the gods saw a sphere of refulgence in the sky pervading all the quarters with its flames.

33. O Vyasa, Brahma and other gods including Indra heard a celestial voice from the sky bestowing their desire. The celestial voice said:

34. O gods, it is I who stand in three forms by the variety of the three attributes, Rajas, Sattva and Tamas. The three forms are Gauri, LaksmI, and Sarasvati.

35. Hence you go to them respectfully at my bidding. If they are pleased they will fulfil your desire.

# Rudrasarhhitd

Sanatkumdra said:

1. Even as the gods were listening to this speech with eyes gaping with wonder, the refulgence vanished.
2. On hearing the speech, the gods, urged by it bowed respectfully to Gauri, LaksmI and SarasvatI.
3. Brahma and other gods eulogised the goddesses with various speeches and bowed their heads.
4. Then the goddesses appeared in front of them, suddenly, O Vyasa, illuminating the quarters with their wonderful brilliance.
5. On seeing them, the gods eulogised them with great devotion and delighted minds. They submitted what they wanted to be carried out.
6. Thus bowed and eulogised, the goddesses who are favourably disposed to the devotees, faced the gods and addressed them eagerly after giving them seeds.

The goddesses said:

Sow these seeds in the place where Visnu is standing. Then your task will be fulfilled.

Sanatkumdra said:

O sage, after saying this, the goddesses, the Saktis of Siva, Visnu and Brahma, possessed of the three attributes, vanished.
Then Brahma and other gods including Indra took the seeds and went to the place where Visnu was standing.
The gods sowed those seeds in the ground where the pyre of Vrnda had been lit. O sage, they stayed there thinking these as parts of Siva’s Sakti.
Out of the seeds sown, O great sage, three plants shot up —the Myrobalan, the Jasmine and the holy basil.
The Myrobalan is born of the creator’s Sakti, the jasmine of LaksmI and holy basil of Gauri, born of the attributes Tamas, Sattva and Rajas.
O sage, on seeing the plants in the forms of ladies Vijnu stood up with excitement of infatuation over them.
On seeing them he was deluded and his mind became overwhelmed by lust. The two plants—the holy basil and Myrobalan looked at him lovingly.



---


50. The womanlike plant born out of the seed by the Sakti of Laksmi became jealous of him.

51. Hence the plant came to be called Varvari (a kind of wild basil) and was despised by all. The Dhalri and the Tulasi are always pleasing to him due to their love and affection.

52. Then Visnu forgot his sorrow. Accompanied by them he went to Vaikunjha fully satisfied. He was bowed to by all the gods.

53. O great brahmin, myrobolan and the holy basil shall be understood as the favourites of gods in the month of Karttika, especially of Vi$nu.

54. There too, O great sage, the holy basil is the most blessed and the most excellent. Except Ganesa it delights every deity and bestows all desires.

55. On seeing Visnu settled again in Vaikuntha, Brahma, Indra and other gods bowed to and eulogised him and then left for their respective abodes.

56. O excellent sage, Visnu too, settled in his own world, freed from delusion and enlightened, became happy remembering Siva as before.

57. This is the narrative that destroys sins, bestows desires to all men. It increases perfect knowledge and quells all aberrations of base lust.

58. He who reads or teaches this every day, he who hears or narrates this with devotion attains the greatest goal.

59. The intelligent man who reads this most excellent narrative and goes to war will certainly be victorious. There is no doubt about it.

60. This yields the knowledge of Vedas to the brahmins, victory to the Ksatriyas, wealth to the Vaisyas and happiness to the Sudras.

61. O Vyisa, it confers devotion to Siva, it destroys the sins of all persons, it bestows the good goal here and hereafter.

240. M&#x26;latl (Jasmine), born of the seed provided by Laksxnf, is called Barbarl or Varvari and forbidden in the worship of Vi?nu.

Sanalkumdra said : —

1. O sage, now listen to another story of Siva lovingly, by listening to which the devotion to Siva is stabilised.
2. The story narrates how the heroic Danava Sankhacuda who harassed the gods was killed by Siva in the battle by means of his trident.
3. O Vyasa, listen lovingly to the story of Siva, divine, holy and destructive of sins. I shall narrate the same because of my affection to you.
4. The sage Kasyapa son of Marici and grandson of Brahma was a virtuous Prajapati engaged in creation. He possessed great learning.
5. Daksa gave him his thirteen daughters in marriage. The descendants of these women are many and they cannot be enumerated easily.
6. The whole universe consisting of gods and others the mobile and immobile is born of them. Who in the three worlds can mention this in detail?
7. Listen to what is relevant to the context wherein the divine sports of Siva too can be seen. It is conducive to the increase of devotion. I am narrating the same.
8. Among the wives of Kasyapa the excellent lady Danu was one. She was very beautiful, chaste and tenderly nurtured by her husband with all devotion and love.
9. Many powerful sons were born to that lady Danu. Their names are not mentioned O sage, by the fear of dilation.
10. One of them is Vipracitti who was very powerful and valorous. His virtuous son Dambha of self-control was a great devotee of Visnu.
11. No son was born to him. Hence the hero became worried. He made the preceptor Sukra his initiator and learnt the mantra of Krsna. He performed a great penance in the holy centre Puskara 241 for a hundred thousand years.

241 Puskara is a sacred forest near Ajmer in Rajasthan. There is a celebrated lake where Brahmi set up a phallic image of Siva. It is a famous place of pilgrimage in RajaputSns.

Seating himself in a stable pose he performed the Japa of Kf?na mantra for a long time.

13. While he was performing the penance, an unbearable refulgence sprang up blazing from his head and spread everywhere.

14. All the gods, sages and Manus were scorched by that. With Indra ahead they sought refuge in Brahma.

15. Bowing to Brahma, the bestower of riches, they eulogised him and narrated to him this event.

16. On hearing that, Brahma accompanied them to Vaikuntha in order to tell the same to Visnu in its entirety.

17. After going there they stood humbly joining their palms in reverence. After bowing to him they eulogised Visnu the lord of the three worlds, the great saviour. The gods said:

18. “O lord of gods we do not know how this happened to cause this. Please tell us. By what refulgence have all of us been scorched?

19. O friend of the distressed, you are the protector of the distressed and dispirited servants. Save, O lord of Laksmi who are worthy of being sought refuge by us.

Sanatkumdra said:

20. On hearing these words of Brahma and other gods, Visnu who is favourably disposed to those who seek refuge, said laughingly and lovingly.

Vifnu said:

21. “O gods, be calm and unperturbed, do not be afraid. No deluge will take place, this is not the time of dissolution.

22. The Asura Dambha a devotee of mine is performing a penance seeking for a son. I shall bestow a boon and quieten him.”

Sanatkumdra said:

other gods became encouraged and they returned to their respective abodes.

24. In order to grant the boon, Vi$nu went to Puskara where Dambha was performing penance.

25. On reaching there Visnu consoled Dambha who was repeating his name and told him the pleasing words “Mention the boon you wish to be granted.”

26. On hearing his words and seeing Visnu standing in front, the Danava bowed with great devotion and eulogised him again and again.

Dambha said:

27. “O lord of gods. Obeisance be to you, O Lotus-eyed one, O lord of Laksmi, O lord of the three worlds, please take pity on me.

28. Please give me a powerful and valorous son who will be your devotee, who will be invincible to the gods and who will conquer the three worlds.”

Sanatkumdra said:

29. On being thus requested by the lord of Danavas, Visnu granted him the boon. O sage, making him desist from the penance he vanished from the place.

30. When Vi$nu went away, the lord of Danavas performed obeisance to that direction and returned home, his penance having been fulfilled and his desires realised.

31. Within a short time, his fortunate wife became pregnant. Illuminating the inner apartments of her abode by her brilliance she shone much.

32. O sage, it was Sudama a cowherd, one of the leading comrades of Krsna who had been cursed by Radha, that entered her womb.

33. At the proper time the chaste lady gave birth to a brilliant son. The father invited sages and performed the post-natal rites.

34. O excellent brahmin, when the boy was there was great jubilation. On an auspicious day the father named him “Sarikhacuda.”

35. In the abode of his father he grew up like the

With his childish sports he increased the parents' delight. He became a special favourite of all the members of the family.

Sanalkumdra said:

1. As instructed by Jaigisavya, Sarikhacuda performed a penance in Puskara for a long time in order to propitiate Brahma with devotion.
2. He concentrated his mind, controlled the senses and organs of activities, and muttered the mantra of Brahma imparted by his preceptor.
3. Lord Brahma, the preceptor of the worlds, went to Sankhacuda who was practising penance at Puskara in order to grant him the boon soon.
4. Brahma said to him: “Tell me the boon you wish to choose.” On seeing Brahma, the king of Danavas bowed to him humbly and eulogised him with words of devotion.
5. He requested Brahma to grant him the power of being invincible to the gods. With a delighted mind, Brahma said “Be it so.”
6. He gave Sarikhacuda the divine amulet of Srikrsna the most auspicious of all auspicious things in the universe, that yielded victory everywhere.
7. “You now go to Badari. There you marry Tulasi who is performing penance just at her own will.
8. She is the daughter of Dharmadhvaja.” Brahma instructed him thus and vanished even as he was watching him.
9. Then Sankhacuda whose penance had been fruitful in the holy centre of Puskara tied the most auspicious amulet round his neck.

12. The smiling beautiful gentle woman fully bedecked in ornaments cast loving glances at the great man.

13. On seeing that charming, tender, beautiful and chaste lady, he stopped near her and spoke to her sweetly.

Sankhacuda said:

14. “Who are you, please? Whose daughter? What are you doing? Why do you stay here and observe silence. Consider me as your devoted slave.”

Sanatkumdra said:

15. On hearing these words she spoke to him lovingly.

Tulasi said:

16. I am the daughter of Dharmadhvaja. I am performing penance. I stay in this hermitage. Who are you? You can go as you please.

17. The entire class of women is fascinating. It enchants even Brahma, not to speak of others. It is censurable, poisonous and deceptive. It is illusion and a fetter to the devout and the faithful.

Sanatkumdra said:

18. Tulasi thus spoke to the passionate Dambha and stopped. On seeing her smiling he began to say.

Even though he may be the observer of sacred rites, if he is overpowered by a woman he becomes impure and unclean, so he remains for ever. The manes, gods and human beings censure him.

# 28-29.

A brahmin is purified from impurity arising from births or deaths in the family, after the tenth day. A Ksatriya in twelve days, a Variya in fifteen days and a Sudra in a month. This is what the Vedas enjoin. But a henpecked man can never be purified till death.

32. You have been tested by me in order to know your knowledge and power. A woman must test her bridegroom before wooing him.

Sanatkumdra said:

33. Even as Tulasi was saying so, Brahma the creator came there and spoke these words.

Brahma said:

34. “O Sarikhacuda, why do you hold discussion with her? Marry her according to the Gandharva form of marriage.

35. You are jewel among men. And she, the chaste lady, is a jewel among women. The union of an intelligent lady with an intelligent man must necessarily be virtuous.

36. O king, unless forced who will abandon a chance of happiness? He who does so unforced is a brute. There is no doubt about it.

37. O chaste lady, why shall you test such a good and noble husband? He can suppress the gods, Asuras and Danavas too.

38. O beautiful woman, you may sport with him for long, as you please, in different centres all over the world.

It was called Gandharva because it prevailed in a tribe called Gandharva which lived on the slopes of the Himalayas. It was considered the most natural form because the bride and the bridegroom attracted each other without any force or fraud. It became obsolete because it was performed without sacred rituals and originated from lust. See H.S. PP. 162-104.

3. They bowed to that resplendent Danava their lord, humbly and eulogised him with love and respect. They stayed with him alone.
4. On seeing the family preceptor, Satikhacuda, son of Dambha bowed to him with devotion and prostrated before him with respect.
5. After conferring his excellent benediction, Sukra, the family preceptor, narrated the tales of the gods and Danavas.
6. He expatiated on the natural enmity of the two, the invariable defeat of the Asuras, the victory of the gods and the help rendered by Brhaspati.
7. With the consent of the Asuras, the preceptor Sukra made him the emperor of Danavas, Asuras and others with jubilant festivities.
8. The delighted Asuras were highly joyous. They offered him presents lovingly.
9. The son of Dambha, the heroic and valorous Sankhacuda shone as the Emperor of Asuras.
10. Taking a vast army of Daityas, Danavas and Raksasas and seated in his chariot, he marched quickly to the city of Indra.

his attendants shone as the moon in the midst of stars or as the sun in the midst of planets.

12. On hearing that Sahkhacuda was coming, Indra the king of heaven, accompanied by the gods made preparations for a fight.

13. Then a tremendous fight ensued between the Asuras and the gods delighting the heroic and terrifying the cowardly. It caused hairs to stand on end.

14. When the warriors roared in the battle, there was a tumultuous noise. The sound of drums and other instruments encouraged the warriors.

15. The powerful gods fought with the Asuras ferociously and defeated them. They were afraid and fled.

16. On seeing them fleeing, their leader Sahkhacuda roared like a lion and fought with the gods.

17. With his power and force he distressed the gods. The gods could not endure his dazzling brilliance. They fled.

18. The gods thus vanquished took shelter in the caves of the mountains. They lost their independence. They were subjugated. They lost their lustre like the frozen sea.

19. Thus the son of Dambha, the valorous leader of the Danavas, conquered all the worlds and took up the powers of the gods.

20. He kept the three worlds under his control. He partook of all the shares in sacrifices. He became Indra and ruled the universe.

21. He carried the tasks of Kubera, Moon, Sun, Fire, Yama and Vayu, according to his ability.

22-23. The great hero, the powerful Sankhacuda became overlord of the gods, Asuras, Danavas, Raksasas, Gandharvas, serpents, Kinnaras, Nagas and in fact of all the people of the three worlds.

24. Thus Saiikhacuda enjoyed the kingdom of the worlds for many years. He became a great Emperor.

25. There was no famine, plague or pestilence in his realm. The planets were not inauspicious. There was no

26. Even without being tilled, the earth yielded plenty of plants and vegetation. Many medicinal herbs grew up. Plants remained always fruitful and juicy.

27. The oceans yielded plenty of gems and jewels. Abundant flowers and fruits grew up on the Earth. Rivers flowed with pure crystal clear water.

28. Excepting the gods all living beings were happy and free from distress. The people of four castes and stages of life maintained their respective duties and activities.

29. When he ruled, none was miserable in the three worlds. Only the gods were reduced to misery and that too by their fratricidal jealousy and enmity.

30. Sankhacuda was a close friend of Krsna, the resident of Goloka. He was powerful, and always engaged in devotion to Krsna.

31. O sage, although he was a Danava, his nature was different. He was born as a Danava due to a previous curse.

32. O dear, thereafter, the defeated gods, deprived of their kingdom, consulted among themselves and went to Brahma’s assembly chamber along with the sages.

33. They saw the creator and bowed to and eulogised him. With distress they explained to him everything in detail.

34. After consoling the gods and the sages, Brahma accompanied by them went to Vaikuntha that yields happiness to the good.

35. Accompanied by the gods, Brahma saw the lord of Lak?ml decorated with a crown, earrings and a garland of wild flowers.

36-37. On seeing Vi$nu bearing Saxikha, Cakra, mace and the lotus, the lord with four arms, yellow garments, accompanied by Nandana, Siddhas, Brahma and other gods bowed to the lord along with the great sages. They eulogised him with palms joined in reverence.

The gods said :

of Vaikuntha, save us who have sought refuge in you, O illustrious Viṣṇu, O elderly one in the three worlds.

39. O lord Viṣṇu, O lord of the three worlds, you alone are the protector of the worlds. O supporter of Lakṣmī, O Govinda, O the vital air of the devotees, Obeisance be to you.

40. After eulogising thus, all the gods cried in front of Viṣṇu. On hearing it lord Viṣṇu spoke to Brahma thus. Viṣṇu said:

41. Why have you come to Vaikuntha inaccessible even to Yogins? What distress has befallen you? Tell me just here.

Sanatkumāra said:

42-43. On hearing the words of Viṣṇu and bowing to him with palms joined in reverence he narrated to him the activities of Sankhacuda and the distress suffered by the gods.

44. On hearing that Viṣṇu who knew everything laughed. The lord then told Brahma the secret of Sankhacuda. Lord Viṣṇu said:

45. O lotus-born Brahma, I know everything about Sankhacuda, a great devotee of mine, of great splendour and who had been formerly a cowherd.

46. Hear all the details about him, the old narrative. There is nothing to be suspected. Śiva will necessarily perform what is good.

47-50. His region called Sivaloka is greater than the greatest. It is above everything. Śiva, the supreme Brahman, the great god shines there. He is the presiding deity of Prakṛti and Purusa. He wears three Śaktis. He is both devoid of attributes and possessed of attributes.

O Brahma, the three deities bringing about creation etc. are born of him. They are Viṣṇu, Brahma and Śiva endowed with Sattvika and other.

51. The Goloka is near it. Siva’s cowshed is situated there. Krsna having my form stays there at Siva’s behest.

52. It is to tend his cows and bulls that he has been ordered by him. Deriving happiness from him he too sports there.

53. His wife Radha 247 is the mother of the universe. Her form is greater than Prakrti. It is the fifth 248 sportive form.

54. Many cowherds and cowherdesses born of her live there. They are sportively inclined and follow Radha and Krsna.

55. That very same (Sudama, now born as Sankhacuda) has been fascinated by her by Siva’s illusion. Cursed by Radha he is born as a Danava to his distress.

56. Krsna has already ordained that the death of Sankhacuda will be by Rudra’s trident. Casting off his body he will become his comrade again.

57. O lord of gods, knowing this you need not have any fear. Let us seek refuge in Siva. He will do everything conducive to our good.

58. You, I and the gods stand here fearless (due to that only).

Sanatkumdra said:

59. After saying this and mentally thinking upon Siva who, the lord of all, is favourably disposed to his devotees, Visnu went to Sivaloka accompanied by Brahma.

247. Radha was a cowherdess and a favourite mistress of Krsna. She is worshipped among the Vaishnavas as an incarnation of Lakshmi and Krsna is of Visnu.

248. The energies of Rudra, Visnu and Brahma are the three embodied forms of Primordial cosmic nature. There is a fourth Energy called Siva of the attributeless Siva. Radha is the supreme and sportive fifth form of Prakrti.

# CHAPTER THIRTY

# (Prayer to the lord of gods)

Sanalkumdra said:

1-2. O Vyasa, starting then itself along with Brahma, Visnu, the lord of Laksmi, went to Sivaloka, highly divine, propless and unearthly. He was glad and his face beamed with pleasure. The region was strewn over with many gems. It was highly brilliant.

3-4. The first entrance was of variegated nature with many Ganas standing there. It was resplendent, lofty and beautiful. After reaching it he saw the gatekeepers seated on gem-set thrones. They had gem-set ornaments and white garments.

5. They had five faces, three eyes and fair handsome bodies. They were trident-bearing heroes shining with Bhasma and Rudraksa.

6. Both Brahma and Vi$nu bowed to them humbly and told them that they wanted to see the lord.

7. They permitted them to enter. They saw another door very beautiful, variegated and very brilliant.

8. They informed the gatekeeper of their desire to approach the lord. Permitted by them they entered and saw another door.

9. Thus Brahma entered through fifteen doors and reached the main threshold. He saw Nandin.

10. After bowing to and eulogising Nandin as Brahma did before, Visnu was permitted by Nandin and he entered joyously.

11. Going in, they saw the grand assembly chamber of Siva, highly decorated and thronged by his attendants with lustrous bodies.

12. The attendants had similar forms with lord Siva. They had ten arms, five faces, three eyes and blue necks. They had auspicious lustre and were brilliant.

13. They were bedecked in ornaments set with gems. They wore Rudraksas. They had smeared themselves with the ashes. The chamber was square in shape and beautiful like the lunar sphere.

# Sivapurdna

14. Geras, necklaces, diamonds, etc. increased its brilliance. Valuable precious stones were used to stud them. It was brightened by lotus petals.

15. Manikya, Padraaraga and other valuable gems were used in the same. It was very wonderful. It was laid according to the desire of Siva.

16. It had hundreds of steps leading to it, each made of Syamantaka stone; knotted golden threads joined them. Beautiful sprouts of sandal beautified it.

17. Columns of sapphire supported it. It was richly decorated. The wind wafted fragrance everywhere.

18. The chamber was a thousand Yojanas wide. Many servants were in attendance. Visnu the lord of gods saw Siva seated along with Parvati.

19. Siva was in the midst of his attendants like the moon surrounded by stars. He was seated in a variegated throne set with valuable gems.

20. He had a crown on his head, earrings in his ears. He was embellished with gem necklaces. Ashes were smeared all over his body. He held a toy lotus.

21. He was smilingly watching the song and dance going on in front of him.

22. He was calm and delighted in the mind. He was highly brilliant. He was chewing the fragrant betel leaves offered by the goddess.

23. He was attended upon by Ganas with white chowries and eulogised by Siddhas with stooping shoulders with great devotion.

24-25. The great lord Siva, the progenitor of the three deities, the lord beyond the reach of attributes, who assumes and discords his forms as he pleases and is invariable, who is free from illusion, unborn, the primordial being, the lord of illusion, greater than the greatest and greater than the Prakfti and Purusa.

26. On seeing Siva of perfect features, Vi$nu and Brahma eulogised him together after bowing to him with palms joined in reverence.

27. O lord Siva, lord of the gods, O supreme Brahman,

lord of all. O quiet one that is beyond the three attributes, O lord progenitor of the three deities.

28. We have sought refuge in you. O lord, save us who are distressed. O lord Siva, we are harassed by Sahkhacuda and so dejected and well nigh exhausted. Save us.

29. The region that is adjacent to this place is called Goloka, Lord Krsna is its presiding deity.

30. One of his leading attendants and comrades, Sudama, cursed by Radha and led by fate, has become the Danava Sarikhacuda.

31. O Siva, the gods divested of all powers ousted and harassed by him roam over the Earth now.

32. Except by you he cannot be killed by any one of the gods. Please kill him and render the worlds happy.

33. You alone are devoid as well as possessed of attributes, truthful, of infinite valour, embedded in the good and greater than Prakrti and Purusa.

34. At creation, O lord, you are Brahma, the creator through Rajas. O protector of the three worlds, in the activity of protection through Sattva you are Visnu.

35. In dissolution through Tamas you are Rudra the annihilator of the universe. In the state free from the three attributes you are Siva the fourth one, of the form of brilliance.

36. At your behest, Krsna the protector, goes to Goloka. Stationed in the middle of your cowshed he sports day and night.

37. You are the cause of all. You are the lord of all. You are Brahma, Visnu and Siva. You are free from aberrations. You are the constant witness. You are the supreme soul, the great Isvara.

38. You are the redeemer of the distressed and the poor, the protector and the kinsman of the distressed, the lord of the worlds. You are favourably disposed to those who seek refuge in you.

39. O lord of Parvati, uplift us. lord Siva, be pleased. O lord, we are subservient to you. You do as you please, lord.

Sanatkumdra said:

After saying this, O Vyasa, those two deities, Vishnu and Brahma bowed to Siva and stopped. They joined their palms in reverence and stood humbly.

# CHAPTER THIRTYONE

# (Siva's advice)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. On hearing these words of the distressed Vishnu and Brahma, Siva laughingly spoke in the rumbling tone of the cloud.

Siva said:

“O dear Vishnu, O Brahma, cast off your fear from all sides. Certainly something good will result from the activities of Sankhacuda.
I know all the details of his activities factually as well as those of Sudami the cowherd devotee of Krishna.
At my bidding Vishnu has assumed the form of Krishna and is stationed in the cowshed in the beautiful Goloka presided over by me.
Considering himself independent under a delusion he indulged in many kinds of sportive dalliance like a deluded licentious person.
On seeing his excessive delusion as a result of my deceptive art I suppressed their virtuous intellect and made them suffer curse.
Having thus performed my sport, I suppressed the illusion. Regaining knowledge they got rid of delusion and became well-intentioned.
They came near me in a piteous plight. After bowing to me they eulogised me devoutly and humbly with palms joined in reverence.
Overwhelmed by shame they told me all the details. Dejected, they lamented before me saying the words "Save us, O save us.”

# Rudrasarhkitd

10. Then I, becoming delighted, told them these words, Krsna, you forget your fear at my behest.

11. I am the protector, always infused with love. Good will befall you. All this has happened at my will. There is no doubt in it.

12. Go to your abode along with Radha and your comrade. He will become a Danava here in Bharata, certainly.

13-14. At the proper time I shall redeem you from the curse. What I told thus Srikrsna and Radha accepted readily. Srikrsna the intelligent rejoiced and returned to his abode. There they engaged themselves in propitiating me and bidding their time.

15. Realising that everything is subject to my control and his will is not independent, Sudama became the lord of Danavas as a result of the curse of Radha.

16. The virtuous demon Sahkhacuqla distresses and harasses the gods always with his might. He is evil-minded to this extent.

17. He has been deluded by my deception and hence he seeks the help of evil ministers. But myself being the chastiser of the wicked you can get rid of his fear quickly.

Sanatkumdra said:

18. O sage, by the time Siva completed this expiation in front of Visnu and Brahma, another event happened there. Listen to it.

19. In the meantime Krsna came there along with Radha and his attendant cowherds in order to propitiate Lord Siva.

20. Devoutly bowing to the lord, meeting Vi$nu with respect and honoured by Brahma with love he stood there awaiting Siva’s behest.

21. Then he bowed again to Siva with palms joined in reverence. Realising the principle of Siva and getting rid of his delusion Krsna eulogised Siva.

22. O supreme God, lord of gods, Supreme Brahman

You are the greatest splendour. You are the eternal being directly pervading everything. O lord of Gaurl, with you as leader, we are well-guided.

# 25-26.

Considering myself above all, I sported about, under the delusion. I reaped the fruit thereof. He who went astray was cursed. O lord, my leading comrade Sudama the cowherd is born as a Danava.

# 27.

O lord of Parvati, uplift us. O supreme lord, be pleased. Please redeem us from the curse. Save us who have sought refuge in you.

# 28.

After saying this, Lord Krsna, accompanied by Radha, stopped. Siva was delighted thereat, Siva who is favourably disposed to those who seek refuge in him.

# Lord Siva said:

# 29.

“O Krsna, O lord of cowherdesscs leave off your fear. Be happy. O dear, all this has been brought about by me with blessing in disguise.

He has become a Danava, an enemy of the gods, named Saiikhacucja as a result of the power of Rfidha’s curse. He hates and belongs to the party of Daityas.

35. Divested of their powers, ousted and harassed by him forever, the demoralized gods including Indra have fled to the ten directions.

36. It is for their sake that Brahma and Visnu have here and sought refuge in me. There is no doubt in this that I will relieve them of their distress.”

Sanatkumdta said:

37. After saying this, he addressed Krsna again eagerly after consoling Visnu and Brahma with words that quelled their agony.

Siva said:

O 38. “O Visnu, O Brahma, lovingly listen to my words. dear ones, go quickly for the pleasure of the gods. Be fearless.

39. Go to Rudra, resident of Kailasa, who has my excellent and perfect form. He has manifested himself for the task of the gods with a separate form and features.

40. O Visnu, it is for this purpose that the lord assuming my form fully and perfectly stays on the mountain Kailasa favouring the devotees by being subservient to them.

41. There is no difference in him from us both. He shall be served by you two and all living beings — mobile and immobile as well as the gods and others always.

42. He who differentiates between us falls into hell. In this life too he will attain stress and be devoid of sons and grandsons.

Sanatkumdra said:

43. After bowing again and again to the lord of Parvati who had spoken thus, Krsna returned to his abode accompanied by Radha.

44. O Vyasa, Visnu and Brahma became delighted and relieved of fear. After bowing again and again to Siva they hastened to Vaikuntha.

250. Mount Kailasa is a part of the Himalayan range lying to the north of Mftnasa-sarovara, not far off from the origin of Ghogra (Sara>u) river. The detailed description of the mount is found in the Matsya P. Ch. iai.

# Sivapurdna

45. Having come there and mentioning everything to the gods, Brahma and Viṣṇu went to Kailasa taking the gods with them.

46-47. On seeing lord Siva there, the lord and husband of Parvatī, who had taken a body for protecting the distressed, the lord of the gods possessed of attributes, they eulogised him as before with devotion and choking words. They joined their palms in reverence humbly and with drooping shoulders. The gods said:

48. O great god, lord of the gods, O Siva, the lord of Parvatī, we seek refuge in you. Please save the terrified gods.

49. Please slay Sankhacuda the king of Asura and the destroyer of the gods. The gods have been defeated and harassed by him.

50. Like men they are roaming on the earth divested of their powers. Their region the Devaloka has become very dreary to look at due to fear.

51. O uplifter of the distressed, O ocean of mercy, redeem the gods, from this exigency. O great lord, save Indra from fright by killing that ruler of Danavas.

Sanatkumāra said:

52. “On hearing the words of the gods, Siva favourably disposed to his devotees spoke to them laughingly in the rumbling tone of the cloud. Lord Siva said:

53. O Viṣṇu, O Brahma, O Gods, return to your own abodes by all means. I shall kill Sankhacuda along with his followers and attendants. There is no doubt about it.

Sanatkumāra said:

# CHAPTER THIRTYTWO

# (The Emissary is sent)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. Then lord Siva, Death to the wicked, goal of the good, decided in his mind to slay Sahkhacuda in accordance with the wishes of the gods.
2. He made his friend the lord of Gandharvas his messenger and sent him in a wonderful chariot hurriedly to Sahkhacuda joyously.
3. At the bidding of lord Siva, the emissary went to the city of the Asura which was superior to Indra’s Amaravati and Kubera’s Palace.
4. Reaching there, he saw the excellent abode of Sahkhacuda in the middle; it shone with its twelve entrance doors with gatekeepers in each.
5. Puspadanta saw the main excellent entrance. Fearlessly he informed the gatekeeper.
6. Passing beyond that door he joyously went in. It was spacious, exquisitely fine and richly decorated.
7. Going in he saw Sahkhacuda, the ruler of Danavas, seated on a gem-set throne in the midst of heroic warriors.
8. He was surrounded by leading Danavas and served by three crores of attendants and guarded by another hundred crores of well armed soldiers moving to and fro.
9. Seeing him, Puspadanta was struck with wonder. He gave the message of war as conveyed by Siva.
10. O great king, O lord, I am the Emissary of Siva

Siva said:

1. Now, give back their kingdom to the gods and their authority. If not, fight with me, the greatest of the good warriors.
2. The gods have sought refuge in me, the lord of the gods and the benefactor of the good. I the infuriated will certainly slay you.
3. I am Siva, the destroyer. I have granted protection to all the gods. I am the holder of the chastising rod for the wicked and favourably disposed to those who seek refuge in me.
4. O lord of Danavas, consider and let me know one of the two alternatives specifically, whether you will return the kingdom or fight.

Puspadanta said:

O lord of Danavas, what has been stated by Siva has been conveyed to you. Siva’s words have never gone in vain.
I wish to return to my lord Siva immediately. After going back what shall I tell Siva, you clearly let me know.

Sanatkum&#x26;ra said:

On hearing these words of Puspadanta who was the emissary of lord Siva, the king laughed, then spoke to him.

SarikhacGda said:

I will never return the kingdom to the god. The earth shall be enjoyed by heroic warriors. O Siva, I shall fight with you who are a partisan of the gods.
The hero who allows another to supercede him is the basest in the world. Hence O Siva I shall certainly march towards you just now.
I reach there in the morning in the course of my victorious campaign. O messenger, go and tell all this to Siva.

Sanalkumdra said:

1. On hearing these words of Sarikhacuda, the emissary of Siva laughed aloud and then spoke haughtily to the lord of the Asuras.
2. O Great king, you cannot face the Ganas of Siva. Then how can you face lord Siva himself?
3. So return their positions of authority to the gods entirely. Move immediately to Patala if you wish to live.
4. O excellent Danava, do not regard Siva an ordinary deity. He is indeed the great soul, the lord of the lord of all.
5. Indra and other gods abide by his commands. The Siddhas, the patriarchs, the sages and the serpent lords all follow suit.
6. He is the overlord of Visnu and Brahma. He is both possessed and devoid of attributes. By a mere twitch of his knitted eyebrow everything is dissolved.
7. Siva is the perfect form of gods, the cause of the annihilation of the worlds, the goal of the good, the destroyer of the wicked. He is free from aberrations. He is greater than the greatest.
8. He is the overlord of Brahma. He is lord Siva even into Vi?nu. O excellent Danava, his behest should never be slighted.
9. Of what avail is an unnecessary digression, O great king. Ponder deeply. Know him to be great lord, the great Brahman, the knowledge-formed.
10. Return their kingdoms to the gods as well as their positions of authority. O dear, thus you will fare well. Otherwise, terror will strike you.

Sanalkumdra said:

On hearing this, the valorous king of the Danavas, deluded by his fate spoke to the emissary of Siva thus.
I shall neither give up kingdom nor the positions

of authority, without a fight with him. This is certain. I tell you the truth.

33. The entire universe whether mobile or immobile is subject to the vagaries of time. Everything originates in time and everything merges into time.

34. Go and tell Siva exactly what I have said to you. Let him do what is proper. Do not talk much.

Sanatkumara said:

35. O good sage, Puspadanta the emissary of Siva when thus addressed by the Asura returned to lord Siva and told him everything duly.

# CHAPTER THIRTYTHREE

# (March of The Victorious Lord Siva)

Sanatkumara said:

1. On hearing those words of the emissary, the infuriated emperor of the gods, Siva spoke to Virabhadra and other Ganas.

Siva said:

2-3. “O Virabhadra, O Nandin, O eight Bhairavas, the frontier guards, let the Ganas start along with my sons, at my bidding. Let those strong ones be ready and fully equipped with weapons. Let Bhadrakal! start with her army for the war. I start just now for slaying Sankhacutja.”

Sanatkumara said —

4. Having ordered thus, lord Siva started along with his army. His delighted heroic Ganas followed him.

5. In the meantime Karttikeya and GaneSa, the overall generals of the army, came near Siva joyously, fully equipped with weapons and ready for war.

2. When Siva’s emissary had departed, what did the valorous Danava, Sahkhacuda do? Please mention that in detail.

Sanalkumara said:

When the messenger returned, the valorous Sahkhacuda went in and told his wife TulasI all the details.

Sahkhacuda said:

O dear lady, infuriated by the words of Siva’s messenger I have prepared for a war. Hence I am going to fight. You carry out my directions.

Sanatkumara said:

After saying this and slighting Siva, that demon professing to be wise advised his wife in various ways and sported with her with delight.
Throughout that night, the couple indulged in sexual dalliance. Uttering coaxing and cajoling words, practising various erotic arts, they immersed themselves in the ocean of happiness.

10. He called his general and ordered him to be ready for the war.

Sahkhac&#x26;da said:

11. O general, let the heroic warriors start for the war. Let them be ready for action; they have been trained well for the war.

12. Let the heroic Dinavas and Daityas, the armies of the powerful Kankas of eighty-six divisions well-equipped in arms set out fearlessly.

22. It is to the north of Srisaila and to the south of Gandhamadana. It is five Yojanas in width and a hundred times as much in length.

23. The river Puspabhadra is very beautiful and full of transparent water. It confers merits on everyone in Bharata, like the river Sarasvati.

24. It starts from Himalaya, has its confluence with Sarasvati. It is the beloved of the briny sea and blesses people with good fortune.

25. It enters the western ocean where Gomanta is on its left. Safikhacuda went there and saw the army of Siva.

26. Malaya (Dravidian: inalai) is identical with the Travancore hills and the southernmost part of the Western Ghats.

# (The conversation between Siva and the emissary of Sankhac&#x26;tfa)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. Stationing himself there, the lord of Danavas sent a leading Danava of great knowledge as his emissary to Siva.
2. The emissary went there and saw the moon-crested lord Siva, of the refulgence of a crore suns, seated at the root of the Banyan tree.
3. He saw him sitting in a yogic pose, showing the mystic gesture with his eyes, with a smiling face and body as pure as crystal and blazing with transcendent splendour.
4. He saw Siva holding the trident and the iron club. He was clad in the hide of the tiger. The emissary saw the three-eyed lord of Parvati, the enlivener of the life of the devotees, the quiet Siva, the dispenser of the fruits of penance, the creator of riches, quick in being propitiated, eager to bless the devotees and beaming with pleasure in his face.
5. He saw the lord of the universe, the seed of the universe, identical with the universe and of universal form, born of all, lord of all, creator of all, the cause of the annihilation of the universe, the cause of causes, the one who enables devotees to cross the ocean of hell, the bestower of knowledge, the seed of knowledge, knowledge-bliss and eternal.
6. On seeing him, the messenger, the leader of Danavas, descended from his chariot and bowed to him as well as to Kumara.
7. He saw Bhadrakali to his left and Karttikeya standing before him. Kali, Karttikeya and Siva offered him the conventional benediction.
8. This emissary of Sarikhacuqla had full knowledge of the sacred texts. He joined his palms in reverence and bowing to him spoke the auspicious words.

The Emissary said:

"O lord, I am the emissary of Sarikhacuqla and have come to you. What is it that you desire? Please tell me."

Sanaikumdra said:

# 12.

On hearing these words of Sankhacuc^a, lord Siva became delighted and spoke.

# 13.

Lord Siva said: O messenger of great intellect, listen to my words conducive to happiness. After pondering over this, without disputation, this shall be mentioned to him.

# 14.

Brahma is the creator of the worlds and father of Dharma. He knows virtue. Marici is his son. Kaiyapa is Marici’s son.

# 15.

Dakja gave him his thirteen daughters, with pleasure. Among them the chaste lady Danu increased his fortune to a great extent.

# 16.

Danu gave birth to four sons called Danavas. They were vigorous and powerful. Vipracitti of great strength and valour was one of them.

# 17.

His son, the virtuous Dambha of great Intellect was the ruler of Danavas. You are his excellent son, a pious soul, and the lord of Danavas.

# 18.

In previous birth you were a cowherd and an attendant of Kr?na. Among the cowherds you were virtuous. As a result of R? dha’s curse, you are born as Danava and have become the king of Danavas.

# 19.

You are casually born as a Danava. You are really no Danava. Realising your previous birth you leave off your inimical attitude to the gods.

# 20.

Don’t be malicious towards them. You can enjoy your kingdom zealously. Do not try to expand your kingdom nor spoil it.

# 21.

O Danava, return their kingdom to the gods. Maintain my affection. Stay in your kingdom happily. Let the gods stay in their region.

# 22.

Do not offend people. Don’t be malicious to the gods. The descendants of Katyapa are noble and indulge in pure activities.

# 23.

Whatever sin is there in the world, even including that of slaughter of a brahmin, does not merit even a sixteenth part of the sin accruing from the offence towards kinsmen.

Hudrasarhhitd 955

Sanatkumdra said:

1. These and many such words of advice, auspiciously based on injunctions of Sruti and Sinpli, Siva said to him enlightening him in an excellent manner.
2. The emissary who had been well instructed by Sankhacuda who knew his duties well but who had been deluded by destiny spoke these words humbly.

The messenger said:

O lord, what has been narrated by you is true. It cannot be otherwise. But let my submission based on certain factual elements be heard.
O lord Siva, verily a great sin has been cited as the result of offence to kinsmen by you now. But does it concern only Asuras and not the gods? Please tell me.
If it applies to all alike, I shall consider it and let you know. Please tell me your decision at the outset and clear my doubts.
O lord Siva, why did the discus-bearing lord Visnu sever the heads of Madhu and Kaitabha the excellent Daityas in the ocean of dissolution?
Your Majesty too, O Siva, is famous as a partisan of the gods. Why did you fight with the Tripuras and reduce them to ashes?
After divesting him of everything why was Bali packed off to Sutala and other regions? Did Visnu go to his threshold as his uplifter?
Why was Hiranyaksa harassed by the gods along with his brother? Why were Sumbha and other Asuras subjected to fall by the gods?

Footnotes:

1. The Asuras Madhu and Kaitabha born of the ear of Vispu in the ocean at the end of a kalpa rushed against Brahmft who appealed for help to Vispu. Visnu extended his arms, seized the Asuras and slew them with his might.
2. For the destruction of seewho assuming form.
3. It refers to the legend of Visnu the and of a dwarf craved from Bali the boon of three steps of ground then stepping over heaven and earth in two strides left the nether region for Bali’s abode.
4. Hiranyikja and Hirapyakaiipu were slain by Visnu in his Boar and Man-lion incarnations respectively.
5. Sumbha, Nisumbha and other Asuras were killed by the Goddess Durgi at the instance of the gods.

33. Formerly when the ocean was churned, the nectar was drunk off by the gods. 274 All the strain and stress was ours but the gods reaped the fruit of our endeavour.

34. The entire universe is but an object of sport of Kala the supreme soul. Whomsoever and whensoever he pleases to bestow the riches he attains them.

35. The enmity of the gods and the Danavas is perpetual and sparked off due to some reason or other. By turns, subject to the whims of Kala they enjoy victory or defeat.

36. Interference on your part in the dispute between the two is futile. This does not behove you, the lord who are equally in touch with both.

37. Your rivalry to us is excessively shameful since you are lord unto the gods as well as to the Asuras. You are the supreme soul.

38. In the event of your victory your fame is not enhanced. In the event of your defeat you suffer a great loss. Let this disadvantage be pondered over.

Sanatkumdra said:

39. On hearing these words, the three-eyed lord laughed and spoke sweetly to the leading Danava what seemed proper;

Lord Siva said:

40. We are subservient to our devotees. We are never independent. We carry out their tasks at their wish. We are not the partisans of any one in particular.

41. Formerly the fight of Viṣnu with the excellent Daityas Madhu and Kaiṭabha in the ocean of dissolution was due to the prior request of Brahma.

42. For the sake of Prahlada, at the request of gods, Hiranyakaśipu was slain by him acting in the interest of his devotees.

them to ashes, only at the request of the gods. It is well known.

44. Formerly Parvati, the Mother of all, the goddess of all, fought with Sumbha and others and killed them only at the request of the gods.

45. Even today, the gods have sought refuge in Brahma. And he along with the gods and the lord Visnu has sought refuge in me.

46. O Emissary, paying heed to the request of Visnu, Brahma and others, I, though lord of all, have come here in the battle of the gods.

47. Really you are the foremost of the comrades of Kf$na, the great soul. Those Daityas who had been formerly killed are not on a par with you.

48. What is there excessively shameful in my fight with you, O king? I the lord have been urged humbly to carry out the task of the gods.

49. Go to Sankhacuda and tell him what I have said. Let him do what is proper. I shall carry out the task of the gods.

1. Sanatkumara said:

50. On saying this, Siva the great god, stopped. The emissary stood up and returned to Sankhacuda.

# CHAPTER THIRTYSIX

# (Mutual fight)

Sanatkumara said:

The emissary returned and mentioned the words of Siva, in detail and truthfully. He conveyed his decision as it was.

2. On hearing that, the valorous Danava Sankhacuda accepted lovingly the alternative of a fight.

3. Hurriedly he got into his vehicle along with his ministers. He commanded his army against Siva.

23. Using these weapons, the heroes severed the heads of each other. It was a jubilant occasion for the roaring heroes of the armies.

24. Elephants, horses, chariots and foot soldiers along with their drivers and riders were hit and split up.

25. The arms, thighs, hands, hips, ears and feet were cut off. The banners, arrows, swords, coats of mail and excellent ornaments were slit and split.

26. The earth shone with heads divested of coronets but with earrings retained, strewn about and with thighs resembling trunks of elephants broken off during the tussle.

27. Severed arms with the ornaments and weapons still retained and other limbs too were lying scattered about like honeycombs.

28. The soldiers running in the battle field saw several headless bodies that jumped with many weapons lifted in their hands.

29. With different kinds of miraculous and ordinary weapons and missiles, the heroes of great strength and valour fought one another shouting and leaping.

30. Some heroes killed the soldiers with their arrows fitted with golden tips and roared like water-laden rumbling clouds.

31. One hero fully encompassed another hero as well as his chariot and charioteer, by discharging heaps of arrows like the rainy season covering up the sun under the clouds.

8. She fought in diverse ways terrifying both the gods and the Danavas. She drank the blood of the Danavas all round.

9. Seizing ten million elephants and an equal number of men with a single hand she playfully thrust them into her mouth.

10. Many thousands of headless bodies danced in the battle field. There was a great tumult that terrified the cowards.

11. Again Karttikeya became furiously angry and showered volleys of arrows. He struck crores of leaders of the Asuras within a trice.

12. The Danavas wounded in their bodies by the numerous arrows of Karttikeya fled in fright. Those who remained were killed.

13. Vj-saparvan, Vipracitti, Danda, and Vikatnpana fought with Karttikeya by turns.

14. Mahamari also fought. She was never routed. All of them afflicted by Karttikeya’s spear were wounded.

15. O sage, Mahamari and Skanda won the battle. Big wardrums were sounded in the heaven. Showers of flowers fell down.

16-17. On seeing the wonderfully terrible fight of Karttikeya that caused wastage in the rank and file of the Danavas like natural disasters, as well as the harassment and havoc wrought by Mahamari, Sankhacuda became furious and himself got ready for the battle.

18-19. He got into his excellent aerial chariot that contained different weapons and missiles, that was set in diamond and that encouraged and emboldened the heroes. Sankhacuda drew the string of the bow upto his ear and discharged volleys of arrows from his seat in the middle of the chariot. He was accompanied by many heroes.

20. His volley of arrows was terrifying. It could not be withstood. A terrible darkness spread in the battlefield.

21. The gods Nandisvara and others fled. Only Karttikeya stayed behind in the battle field.

22. The king of Danavas showered mountains, serpents, pythons and trees so terrifyingly that it could not be withstood.

# 23.

Oppressed by that shower Karttikeya, the son of Siva, looked like the sun enveloped by thick sheets of frost.

# 24.

He exhibited many types of illusions in the manner indicated by Maya. O excellent sage, none of the gods or Ganas understood it.

# 25.

At the same time, the powerful Sankhactida of great illusion split his bow with a divine arrow.

# 26.

He split his divine chariot and the horses pulling it. With a divine missile he shattered the peacock too.

# 27.

The Danava hurled his spear as refulgent as the sun fatally on his chest whereat he fell unconscious by the force of the blow.

# 28.

Regaining consciousness, Karttikeya the destroyer of heroic enemies, mounted his vehicle of sturdy build, set with gems.

# 29.

Remembering the feat of lord Siva accompanied by Parvati, and taking up weapons and missiles, the six-faced deity fought terrifically.

# 30.

With his divine missiles, the son of Siva split the serpents, mountains, trees and rocks, everything furiously.

# 31.

He prevented a conflagration by the missile of cloud. He split the chariot and the bow of Sankhacuda playfully.

# 32.

He split his armour, coronet and the vehicles. He roared like a hero and shouted again and again.

# 33.

He hurled his spear refulgent like the sun at the chest of the lord of Danavas. At the blow he fell unconscious.

# 34.

That powerful Asura got rid of the affliction in a Muhurta and regained consciousness. With a leonine vigour he got up and roared.

# 35.

He bit Karttikeya of great strength with his spear. Not making that spear, a gift of Brahma, futile, Karttikeya fell on the ground.

# 36.

Taking him on her lap Kali brought him near Siva. By his divine sport and perfect wisdom Siva enlivened him.

# 37.

Siva gave him infinite strength. As a result of that the valorous Karttikeya stood up and felt inclined to go to the battlefield.

44. NandisVara and other heroes, the gods, Gandharvas, Yaksas, Rak$asas and serpents followed her.

45. Drum-bearers and wine-carriers 277 accompanied them in hundreds. Heroic warriors on either side were active again.

Sanalkumdra said:

1. Going to the battle ground, the goddess Kali roared like a lion. On hearing that the Danavas fainted.

2. She laughed boisterously again and again boding ill to the Asuras. She drank the distilled grapewine and danced on the battle ground.

3. The manifestations of Durga viz—Ugradamjtra (one with fierce fangs) Ugradantja (one with fierce baton) and Kotavi (the naked) danced on the battle ground and drank wine.

277. The expression ‘MaphuvAhaka* indicates that the custom of drinking wine among the fighting ranks in the battlefield prevailed even in ancient days.

# 4.

There was great tumult on the side of the Ganas and the gods. All the gods and the Ganas roared and rejoiced.

# 5.

On seeing Kali, Sankhacutja hastened to the battle ground. The Danavas were frightened but the king Sankhacutja assured them of protection.

# 6.

Kali hurled fire as fierce as the flame of dissolution which the king put out sportively by means of Vai$nava missiles.

# 7.

Immediately the goddess hurled the Narayana missile at him. The missile developed its power on seeing the Danava Sarikhacucja.

# 8.

On realising it as fierce as the flame of fire of dissolution, the Danava Sankhacuda fell flat on the ground and bowed again and again.

# 9.

On seeing the Danava humbled the missile turned away. Then the goddess hurled the Brahma missile with due invocation through the mantra.

# 10.

On seeing the missile blazing he bowed and fell on the ground. The leader of the Danavas thus prevented the Brahma missile from attacking him.

# 11.

Then the infuriated leader of the Danavas drew the bow violently and discharged divine missiles at the goddess with due invocation through the mantras.

# 12.

Opening the mouth very wide she swallowed the missiles and roared with a boisterous laugh. The Danavas were terrified.

# 13.

He then hurled a Sakti, a hundred Yojanas long at Kali. By means of divine missiles she broke it into a hundred pieces.

# 14.

He hurled the Vai$nava missile on Kali. She blocked it with the MaheSvara missile.

# 15.

Thus the mutual combat went on for a long time. All the gods and Danavas stood as mere onlookers.

# 16.

Then the infuriated goddess Kali, as fierce as the god of death on the battleground, took up angrily the Palupata arrow sanctified by mantras.

278. The reference to the missiles of unfailing effect discharged with the magic formulae indicates the heights that military science had attained in that age.

1. In order to prevent from being hurled, the embodied celestial voice said, “O goddess, do not hurl this missile angrily at Sankhacuda.”
2. “O Candika, the death of this Danava will not take place even through the never failing Pa£upata missile. Think of some other means for slaying this warrior Sankhacuda.”
3. On hearing this, Bhadrakali did not hurl the missile. Sportively she devoured ten million Danavas as if in hunger.
4. The terrible goddess rushed at Sankhacuda to devour him. The Danava prevented her by means of the divine missile of Rudra.
5. Then the infuriated leader of the Danavas hurled a sword, as fierce as the summer sun, with sharp and terrific edge.
6. On seeing the blazing sword approaching, Kali furiously opened her mouth and swallowed it even as Sankhacuda stood watching.
7. The lord of Danavas hurled many divine missiles but before they reached her she broke them into hundreds of pieces.
8. Again the great goddess rushed at him in order to devour him. But that glorious Danava, leader of all Siddhas vanished from sight.
9. Thus unable to see him, Kali who rushed with great velocity crushed his chariot and killed the charioteer with her fist.
10. Then Sankhacuda, an expert in using deception returned quickly and forcefully hurled the wheel blazing like the flame of fire of dissolution, at Bhadrakali.
11. The goddess sportively caught hold of the wheel with her left hand and immediately swallowed it.
12. The goddess then hit him with her fist forcefully and angrily. The king of Danavas whirled round and fainted for a short while.
13. Immediately the Danava regained consciousness and got up valorously. He did not fight her with his arms by the thought that she was a woman like his mother.
14. The goddess seized the Danava, whirled him again and again and tossed him up with great anger and velocity.

31. The valorous SahkhacutJa fell down after being tossed up very high. He got up and bowed down to Bhadrakall.

32. Highly delighted thereafter, he got into a beautiful aerial chariot of exquisite workmanship set with gems and did not lose the balance of his mind in the battlefield.

33. Hungrily Kali drank the blood of the Danavas. In the meantime an unembodied celestial voice said:

34. O goddess, a hundred thousand haughty leading Danavas have been left out in the battle still roaring. Devour them quickly.

35. Do not think of slaying the king of Danavas. Goddess, SahkhacutJa cannot be killed by you. It is certain.

36-37. On hearing these words from the firmament, Bhadrakall drank the blood and devoured the flesh of many Danavas and went near Siva. She then narrated to him the events of the war in the proper order.

# CHAPTER THIRTYNINE

# (The annihilation of the army of SahkhacutJa)

Vydsa said:

1. O intelligent one, on hearing the narrative of Kali what did Siva say? What did he do? Please narrate to me. I am eager to know it.

Sanatkumara said:

2. On hearing the words of Kali, lord Siva, the actor of great divine sports, laughed. Siva consoled her.

3. On hearing the celestial voice, Siva, an expert in the knowledge of principles, went himself to the battle along with his Ganas.

4. He was seated on his great bull and surrounded by Virabhadra and others, the Bhairavas and the K$etrapalas all equal in valour to him.

5. Assuming a heroic form, lord Siva entered the

Rudrasaihhitd
battle ground. There Siva shone well as the embodied form of the annihilator.

1. On seeing Siva, Sarikhacuqla got down from the aerial chariot, bowed with great devotion and fell flat on the ground.
2. After bowing to him he immediately got into his chariot. He speedily prepared for the fight and seized the bow and the arrows.
3. The fight between Siva and the Danava went on for a hundred years and they showered arrows fiercely like clouds pouring down incessantly.
4. The heroic Sankhacucja discharged terrible arrows playfully. Siva split all of them by means of his arrows.
5. Maharudra, the odd-eyed Siva, the punisher of the wicked and the goal of the good, angrily hit his limbs with various weapons.
6. Taking up his sharp sword and the leather shield the Danava rushed at the sacred bull of Siva and hit it on its head.
7. When his bull was hit, Siva sportively cut off the sword and the shining shield by means of his K$urapra.
8. When the shield was split, the Asura hurled his spear. Siva split it into two with his arrow as it came before him.
9. The infuriated Danava, Sankhacuda hurled a discus. Immediately Siva smashed it into pieces with his fist.
10. He hurled his club with force at Siva. Rapidly split by Siva, the club was reduced to ashes.
11. Then seizing an axe with his hand, the infuriated king of Danavas, Sankhacuda rushed at Siva.
12. By the volley of his arrows Siva sportively struck the Asura with axe in his hand. The Danava quickly regained consciousness and got into his excellent chariot. With divine weapons and arrows he encompassed the whole sky and shone.
13. On seeing him coming on, Siva sounded his ipamaru enthusiastically and twanged the bowstring, the noise whereof was unbearable.
14. The lord filled all the quarters with the sound of his horn, Siva himself roared then, frightening the Asuras.



---


21. The lordly bull then bellowed putting the haughty trumpeting elephants to shame. The deep roar filled the sky, the earth and the eight quarters.

22. With his hands the fierce lord Siva clapped the earth and the sky. All the previous shouts and roars were surpassed by that sound.

23. The K?etrapala produced a boisterous laughing sound boding ill to the Asuras. In that great battle Bhairava too roared.

24. There was a terrific tumult in the midst of that battle. All round amongst the Ganas, the shouts of heroes rose up.

25. The Danavas were frightened by those harsh and terrible sounds. On hearing them the powerful king of Danavas became very furious.

26. When Siva shouted “O wicked one, stay by. Stay by”, the gods and the Ganas rapidly shouted “victory, Victory”.

27. Then coming again the valorous son of Dambha hurled at Rudra his spear terrible with shooting flames.

28. While it came on, blazing brilliantly like a great conflagration in the battleground, it was immediately suppressed by Ksetrapala by means of the meteor springing from his mouth.

29. Again the great battle between Siva and the Danava was resumed. The heaven and the earth including all mountains, oceans and rivers shook and trembled.

30. Siva split up the arrows discharged by the son of Dambha by means of hundred and thousands of his fierce arrows. Similarly the arrows of Siva were split up by the Danava.

31. Then the infuriated Siva hit him with his trident. Unable to bear that blow he fell unconscious on the ground.

32. The Asura regained consciousness rapidly. He seized his bow and hit Rudra and all others by means of his arrows.

33. The valorous Sankhacu^a assumed ten thousand arms by means of magic and rapidly enveloped Siva by means of ten thousand discuses.

34. Then Siva, the infuriated consort of Durga, the



---

Rudrasarhhita
destroyer of all insurmountable distress split the discuses rapidly by means of his excellent arrows.

35. Then the Danava seized his mace and accompanied by a huge army rushed at Siva with the intention to kill him.

36. The infuriated Siva, the destroyer of the pride of the wicked split the mace of the Danava rushing headlong by means of a sharp-edged sword.

37. When the mace was split, the Danava became very furious. The brilliant Danava took up a spear that blazed unbearable to the enemies.

38. By means of his trident Siva hit the comely king of Danavas rapidly in the chest even as he approached with the spear in his hand.

39. From the chest of &#x26;ankhacu(Ja pierced by the trident, a valorous huge being came out and said “Stand by, Stand by”.

40. Laughing noisily Siva severed the terrible head of the being that was coming out, by means of a sword. He fell on the ground.

41. Then spreading her mouth wide open Kali furiously devoured innumerable Asuras whose heads were crushed by her fierce fangs.

42. The excited and infuriated K$etrapala devoured many other Daityas. Some were killed struck down by Bhairava’s missiles. Others were wounded.

43. Virabhadra furiously destroyed many other heroes. NandHvara killed many other demons.

44. Thus the other Ganas, readily prepared and furiously heroic, destroyed many Daityas, Asuras and suppressors of the gods.

45. Thus a major portion of his army was destroyed there. Many other soldiers, cowardly and terrified, fled.

# CHAPTER FORTY

# ( Sankhacuda is slain)

Sanatkumara said:

1. On seeing the important and major portion of his army killed, including heroes as dear to him as his life, the D&#x26;nava became very furious.
2. He spoke to Siva. “I am here standing ready. Be steady in the battle. What is it to me, if these are killed? Fight me standing face to face.”
3. O sage, after saying this and resolving resolutely the king of Danavas stood ready facing Siva.
4. The Danava hurled divine missiles at him and showered arrows like the cloud pouring rain.
5. He exhibited various kinds of deceptive measures invisible and inscrutable to all the excellent gods and Ganas and terrifying as well.
6. On seeing that, Siva sportively discharged thereat the excessively divine MaheSvara missiles that destroy all illusions.
7. All the illusions were quelled rapidly by its brilliance. Though they were divine missiles they became divested of their brilliance.
8. Then in the battle, the powerful lord Siva suddenly seized his trident which could not be withstood even by brilliant persons, in order to slay him.
9. In order to prevent him an unembodied voice said — “O Siva, do then, celestial not hurl the trident now. Please listen to this request.
10. O Siva, by all means, you are competent to destroy the entire universe in a trice. What doubt then in regard to a single Danava Sankhacuda?
11. Still, the limit imposed by the Vedas should not be disregarded by you, the lord. O great god, listen to that. Make it truthful and fruitful.
12. O lord Siva, it has been mentioned by Brahma, that, as long as he wears the armour of Vi?pu and as long as his wife maintains the marital fidelity, Sankhacuda has neither death nor old age. Please make those words truthful.

# Rudrasartihita

14. On hearing this celestial voice, Siva said “So be it”. Visnu came there at the wish of Siva. Siva, who is the goal of the good, commanded him.

15. Then, in the guise of an old brahmin, Visnu, the foremost of those who wield magic, approached Sankhacuda and told him. The aged brahmin said:

16-17. “O lord of Danavas, give me the alms for which I have come to you. I shall not say openly what I wish to have from you who are favourably disposed to the distressed. I shall tell you when you have promised me first.

18. With face and eyes indicating pleasure the king replied affirmatively. Then deceptive Visnu in the form of a brahmin said —“I am the suppliant your inarmour.” On hearing that, the lord for Danavas, a well wisher of the brahmins and of truthful word handed over the divine armour, his vital breath, to the brahmin.

19. Visnu thus snatched off his armour by means of deception. Then in the guise of Sankhacuda, Visnu approached Tulasl.

20. Lord Visnu, an expert in wielding magic went there and deposited his semen in her vaginal passage for the protection of gods.

21. In the meantime the lord of Danavas approached Siva without the armour. He took up his trident that blazed to slay Sankhacuda.

22. That trident, named Vijaya, of Siva, the great Atman, shone illuminating heaven and earth.

23. It was as refulgent as a crore midday suns and as fierce as the shooting flame of fire at the time of dissolution. It could neither be prevented nor withstood. It was never ineffective in destroying enemies.

24. It had a fierce halo all round. It was the best of all weapons and missiles. It was unbearable to gods and Asuras. It was terrible to all.

25. In order to annihilate the whole cosmos sportively all brilliance had converged into it.

26. It was a thousand Dhanus in length and a hundred



---


972 Sivapur&#x26;na

Hastas in width. It was in the form of individual as well as universal soul. It was eternal and uncreated.

28. That trident whirling round over the head of Sankhacucja for a while fell on the head of the Danava at the behest of Siva and reduced him to ashes.

29. O brahmin, then it rapidly returned to Siva and having finished its work went away by the aerial path with the speed of the mind.

30. The Dundubhis were sounded in the heaven. Gandharvas and Kinnaras sang. The sages and the gods eulogised and the celestial damsels danced.

31. A continuous shower of flowers fell over Siva. Visnu, Brahma, Indra, other gods and sages praised him.

32. Sankhacu(Ja the king of Danavas was released from his curse by the favour of Siva. He regained his original form.

33. All the conches in the world are formed of the bones of Sahkhacucja. Except for Siva, the holy water from the conch is sacred for every one.

34. O great sage, particularly to Vi$nu and Laksmi the water from the conch is pleasant. To all persons connected with Visnu it is so but not to Siva.

35. After slaying him thus, Siva went to Sivaloka seated on his bull, joyously, accompanied by Parvatl, Karttikeya and the Ganas.

36. Vi$nu went to Vaikun{ha. Krsna became complacent. The gods went to their abodes with great delight.

37. The universe regained normalcy. The whole earth was freed of obstacles. The sky was pure. The whole world became auspicious.

38. Thus I have narrated to you the delightful story of lord Siva that removes all misery, yields wealth and fulfils cherished desires.

39. It is conducive to prosperity and longevity. It prevents all obstacles. It yields worldly pleasure and salvation. It confers the fruits of all cherished desires.

40-41. The intelligent man who hears or narrates the story of the moon-crested lord, or reads or teaches it shall undoubtedly derive wealth, grains, progeny, happiness, all desires and particularly devotion to Siva.

42. This narrative is unequaled. It destroys all torments. It generates great knowledge. It increases devotion to Siva.

43. The brahmin listener attains brahminical splendour; the Ksatriya becomes a conqueror; the VaiSya rich and the Sudra the most excellent of men.

# CHAPTER FORTYONE

# (The curse of Tulasi)

Vydsa said:

How did the lord Narayana manage to deposit his semen in the vaginal passage of Tulasi? Please narrate the same.

Sanatkumdra said: —

2. Narayana is the person who carries on the task of the gods. He is the goal of the good. It was in the guise of Sarikhacuda that he indulged in sexual dalliance with his wife.

3. Listen to the story of Visnu that causes delight, the story of Visnu who acts at the behest of Siva and Parvati, the mother of the worlds.

4-5. On hearing the aerial voice in the course of the war and urged by lord Siva, Visnu carried off the excellent armour of Sankhacuqla assuming the guise of a brahmin, rapidly, by having recourse to his Maya. He then assumed the guise of Sankhacutfa and went to Tulasi’s palace.

6. Very near the entrance to Tulasi’s palace he caused the drum Dundubhi to be beaten and cries of victory to be raised. He thus made the beautiful woman wake up.

7. On hearing it that chaste lady was highly delighted. Eagerly she peeped through the window into the high way.

8. Knowing that her husband had returned she observed all auspicious rites and offered monetary gifts to the brahmins. She then beautified herself.

9. After descending from the chariot, Vijnu who...

10. On seeing her husband come before her she became delighted. She washed his feet, bowed to him and cried.

11. She made him sit on the gemset throne of great beauty. She handed him the auspicious betel leaf rendered fragrant with camphor.

12. “It is today that my life has become fruitful since I see my beloved lover who had gone to fight back in the abode again.

13. Saying so glancing at him with ogling eyes and smiling face she sweetly asked him about the events at the battlefield.

Tulasi said:

14-18. “O lord, how did you fare in the battle with Siva who renders help to the gods? You had gone to fight Siva who is the foremost of the gods, who is the annihilator of innumerable universes, whose behests are strictly adhered to and carried out by Visnu, Brahma and other gods always, who is the progenitor of the three deities, who is the soul of three attributes, who being devoid of attributes puts on the form of attributes at the request and wish of the devotees; who makes Vijnu and Brahma work, who assumed the form of Siva the resident of Kailasa at the request of Kubera, who is the lord of Ganas, the supreme Brahman, the goal of the good; in a single moment according to whose calculation a crore cosmic worlds undergo destruction; and in whose minutest time many Visnus, Brahmas and others pass away. It is with such a Siva that you had gone to fight.

19. You have happily returned after defeating him, the great lord. How did you win? Please mention that to me.”

20. On hearing these words of Tulasi, Vi$nu, the lord of Laksmi who had assumed the guise of Sankhacucja, laughed and spoke sweet words to her.

# Rudrasarhhitd

Lord Vijnu said:

21. “When I, fond of war, reached the battle ground there was a great tumult. A great battle ensued.

22. There ensued the battle between the gods and the Danavas both desiring victory. The daityas were defeated by the gods who were proud of their strength.

23. Then I fought with the powerful gods. The gods defeated by me sought refuge in Siva.

24. In order to help them Siva came to fight. Proud of strength I fought with him for a long time.

25. My dear wife, we fought continuously for a year. Lovely woman, all the Asuras were destroyed.

26. Brahma made us come to a peace. At the bidding of Brahma the powers of authority were re-assigned to the gods.

27. I have returned home. Siva has returned to Sivaloka. Everyone has resumed health and normalcy. The torment has receded.

Sanatkumara said:

28. After saying this the lord of the worlds lay down on his bed. Then out of joy Visnu indulged in sexual intercourse.

29. That lady began to suspect on observing a change in her happiness, endearment and attraction and asked him “who are you?

Tulasi said:

30. Who are you? Tell me quickly. I have been enjoyed by you deceptively. My modesty has been outraged. Hence I am going to curse you.”

Sanatkumara said:

31. On hearing the words of Tulasi, Vi$nu became afraid of the curse. O Brahmin, sportively he re-assumed his own real beautiful form.

32. On seeing the characteristic signs she guessed that it was V$jpu. Infuriated by the violation of her chastity she said.

Tulasi said:

1. “O Viṣṇu, you are ruthless. Your mind is like a rock. Since my chastity has been outraged my husband is doomed.
2. O wicked one, being ruthless you are like a rock. Hence due to my curse you will become a rock.
3. Those who call you ocean of mercy are erring. There is no doubt. How was a devotee killed for another man’s sake, even without any offence?”

Sanatkumāra said:

After saying this, the chaste beloved of Sankhācūḍa, Tulasi lamented again and again in the excess of her grief.
On seeing her crying, Viṣṇu remembered lord Sankara, Parameśvara, by whom the universe is deluded.
Then Sankara, favourably disposed to his devotees appeared in front of them. He was bowed to and eulogised humbly by Viṣṇu.
On seeing Viṣṇu distressed and the beloved lady lamenting, Śiva kind to the poor tactfully enlightened both of them.

Śiva said:

“O Tulasi, do not cry. Every one reaps the fruit of his actions. In the world that is an ocean of actions and rites there is no external entity that bestows happiness and sorrow.
Listen to what is relevant to the context to get rid of misery. Let Viṣṇu of good intentions too, listen. I shall mention what is beneficent to both and conducive to happiness.
O gentle lady, penance had been performed by you. The fruit thereof has been attained now. How can it be otherwise?
Cast off this body. Take up a divine body and indulgence in dalliance with Viṣṇu for ever. Be equal unto Lakṣmī.

Sanatkumdra said :

1. After saying so, Siva narrated the greatness of Salagrama stone and Tulasi, that is highly meritorious.
2. After delighting Visnu and Tulasi, Siva the benefactor of the good vanished from there and went to his abode.
3. On hearing the words of Siva, Tulasi was delighted. She cast off that body and assumed a divine form.

# 2.

Please narrate another story of that great soul, lord Siva who indulges in divine sports delightful to the devotees, by resorting to magic practices.

Brahma said:

# 3.

On hearing the story of the annihilation of Sankha-cuda, Vyasa the son of Satyavatl enquired of the excellent sage, son of Brahma, the very same matter.

# 4.

Sanatkumara narrated to Vyasa the son of Satyavatl—the auspicious and admirable story of lord Siva. Sanatkumara said:

# 5.

O Vyasa, listen to the auspicious story of lord Siva in relation to Andhaka how the latter attained the leadership of Ganas from Siva, the great soul.

# 6.

O great sage, it was after a great fight with the gods and by propitiating lord Siva again and again with Sattvika devotion that he attained the leadership.

# 7.

It is wonderful indeed, the greatness of Siva is wonderful. Siva protects those who seek refuge in him. He is favourably disposed to his devotees. He indulges in different kinds of sports.

# 8.

On hearing about the greatness of the bull-bannered lord, the sage, son of Gandhavatl bowed to the great sage, son of Brahma, with devotion and spoke these meaningful words.

# Vyasa said:

# 9.

O holy one, O lord of sages, who is this Andhaka? In which warrior family on the earth was this powerful great Andhaka born? What was his parentage? What is his importance?

# 10.

O son of Brahma, please let me know all this entirely along with its mystic secrets. You281 have learnt this well from Karttikeya of immeasurable enlightenment, the son of lord Siva.

Really that Andhaka was blessed since he became the lord of the Ganas.

Brahma said:

12. On hearing the words that son of Brahma spoke to Vyasa the father of Suka282 who desired to hear about the wonderful sports of lord Siva which give prosperity to the hearer.

Sanatkumara said:

13. Formerly Siva, the Emperor of the gods, kind to his devotees came to Kashi283 from Kailasa accompanied by Parvati, the daughter of the mountain and his Ganas because he was desirous of sporting there.

14. He built his capital there. He appointed the hero Bhairava as its protector. Then he performed many sports, pleasing to the people, in the company of Parvati the daughter of the mountain.

15. Once he went to the mountain Mandara284 to see its excellent grandeur. He sported much in the company of Siva and the various principal heroic Ganas.

16. While sporting on the eastern ridges of the Mandara mountain, Parvati sportively and playfully closed the eyes of Siva of fierce exploit.

17. She closed the eyes with her lotus-like hands which had the lustre of coral and golden lotus. When Siva’s eyes were closed, a great darkness spread immediately.

18. By this contact with lord Siva the rapturous rutting juice exuded from her hands became hot by the fire of the eye on his forehead and flowed out in copious drops.

19. Conception took place and a terrible inhuman being manifested itself. It was furious, ungrateful, blind286.

deformed, and black in colour. It had matted locks of hair and fine hair all over the body.

20. It sang, cried, laughed, danced, put out its tongue like a serpent and thundered fiercely. When this curious creature arose, Siva smilingly spoke to Parvati.

Lord Siva said:

21. “You did it yourself by closing my eyes. O my beloved, why are you afraid of it now? On hearing these words of Siva, Parvati smilingly took off her hands from the eyes.

22. When light spread everywhere the blind being appeared even more terrible. On seeing such a being, Parvati asked her lord Siva.

Parvati said:

23. O lord, what is this ugly hideous being that is born in front of us. Please tell me the truth - Why was it created? By whom? Whose child is it?

Sanatkumdra said:

24. On hearing these words of his beloved, the sportively inclined mother of the three worlds and the cause of creation of the blind creatures, lord Siva himself indulging in sports smilingly said:

Lord Siva said:

25. O Parvati of mysterious activities, listen. When my eyes were closed by you, this being of wonderfully fierce might was born of my sweat. He shall be named Andhaka. You are the cause of his creation though not in the natural way.

26. He shall be guarded by the Ganas lovingly as well as by you along with your friends. His well being rests with you. Noble lady, pondering over this intelligently you shall do everything.

28. At that time, the Asura Hiranyaksa desired to obtain a son at the pressure of his wife who was envious at the sight of many sons of her husband’s elder brother.

Accordingly he set out in the season of late winter.

29. He resorted to forest and performed penance for obtaining son. In order to see lord Siva he performed a rigorous penance conquering the passions of anger etc. and remaining insensible to external sensation as does a log of wood.

30. The trident-bearing lord was pleased at his penance. A great brahmin he went there in order to grant him the boon. After reaching that spot, lord Siva, the bull-bannered lord, spoke to the leading Daitya.

Lord Siva said:

32. “O lord of Daityas, do not curb your senses so much. Why have you taken up this sacred rite? Speak out what you desire. I am Siva, the granter of desires. I shall grant whatever you desire.”

Sanatkumdra said:

On hearing the pleasing words of lord Siva, the Daitya Hiranyaksa was delighted. He joined his palms in reverence and humbly bowed his head. Eulogising and bowing in various ways he spoke to lord Siva.

Hiranyaksa said:

33. O moon-crested lord, I have no powerful son befitting the race of Daityas. It is for this purpose that I have resorted to penance. O lord of gods, give me a powerful son.

34. My brother has five sons of infinite valour, Prahlada being the eldest. I don’t have any son. My family is likely to be extinct. Who will inherit my kingdom after me?

37. A person whose family is extinct cannot have higher regions. 28 It is for obtaining the son that people worship the deities.

Sanatkumdra said:

38. On hearing these words of the king, the kind-hearted Siva was satisfied and spoke thus—“O ruler of Daityas, there may not be a son born of your semen. But I shall grant you a son.

39. My son Andhaka has a prowess equal to yours. He cannot be defeated by any. You choose him as your son. Cast off your distress and accept him as your son.”

40. After saying this, the delighted lord gave the son to Hiranyaksa. 289 Siva, the great soul, the primordial lord of Bhutas, the destroyer of Tripuras, the fierce god went away, accompanied by Parvati.

41. After getting a son from Siva that Daitya circumambulated Siva and worshipped him with many hymns. Joyously the noble Asura returned to kingdom.

42. Having obtained a son from Siva, the demon of great and fierce valour conquered all the gods and took the earth to Patala.

43. Then the gods, sages and the Siddhas propitiated.

287. The fourth Pada of the Sanskrit text is obscure. Hence the present English translation of the relevant portion is conjectural.

28C. The ancient Indian scriptures hold that a person cannot enter into heaven without having a son. The present context shows that this view prevailed even among the Asuras.

2&#x26;ry. The custom of adopting sons prevailed in ancient India. The adopted son enjoyed all the prerogatives of the natural son. He could offer oblations to his adopted father when he expired and legally inherit his property. It is evident from the present context that the practice was in vogue even among the Asuras.

Vi$nu of infinite vigour in the form of a Boar that constituted all sacrifices and all beings and was terrific in form.

44-46. He split the earth by beating and striking with his snout and entered Patala. He powdered hundreds of Daityas with his nose and the formidable curved fangs. He smashed the armies of the Asuras by kicking with his legs dazzling like lightning. He had a wonderfully fierce refulgence. With his Sudar£ana dazzling like a crore of suns he chopped off the burning head of Hiranyakga and reduced the wicked Daityas to ashes. He was then delighted to crown his son Andhaka as the king of Daityas.

47. He returned to his abode. He lifted up the earth from the Patala by means of his fangs. He sustained the Earth as before.

48. Eulogised by the gods, the delighted sages, and Brahma, lord Visnu of huge body who had assumed the form of a Boar finished the task and returned to his abode.

49. When Hiranyak$a the king of Asuras was killed by Visnu assuming the form of a Boar, the gods, sages and other living beings became happy.

Vydsa said:

1. O Santakumara of great intellect, when that Asura was killed what did his elder brother, the great Asura, do?

2. O great sage, I am eager to hear this. O son of Brahma, please narrate the same. Obeisance be to you.

Brahmd said:

3. On hearing these words of Vyasa, that great sage, Sanatkumara spoke after remembering the lotus like feet of Siva.

290. It refers to the Daitya Hiranylk^a who dragged the earth to the depths of the ocean. Vifnu incarnated himself as the Boar, slew the Daitya and restored the earth to its original position.

Sanatkumara said:

1. When his brother was thus killed by Visnu in the form of a Boar, O Vyasa, Hiranyakasipu was distressed with grief and excited by anger.
2. Always fond of enmity with Visnu that he was, he instigated heroic Asuras, fond of havoc, to work havoc among the people.
3. Receiving the command of their lord with bowed heads, the Asura fond of havoc worked havoc among the gods and the people.
4. Thus when the universe was utterly disturbed by the evil-minded Asuras, the gods abandoned heaven and roamed on the Earth unobserved.
5. After performing the obsequies and water oblations to his departed brother, the distressed Hiranyakasipu consoled his wife and others.
6. Then the emperor of the Daityas desired to make himself invincible, undying, unageing, unrivalled and sole ruler.
7. He performed a severe penance in the ravine of the Mandara mountain. Keeping his arms lifted up he fixed his eyes on the sky. He stood on the Earth on his big toes alone.
8. When he was performing penance, the gods accompanied by their forces defeated the Daityas and regained their lost seats.
9. The smoking fire of penance springing from his head, spreading all round scorched the worlds all round, above and below.
10. The gods scorched by that, abandoned heaven and went to Brahma’s region. With their faces turned pale and deformed by his penance they informed the creator of everything.
11. O Vyasa, thus informed by the gods, the self-born Brahma went to the hermitage of the Daitya accompanied by Bhrgu, Daksa and others.

991. A handful of water mixed with leumum is offered to the departed soul.

15. The Asura who had already scorched the worlds saw that the lotus-born deity had arrived. In order to grant him the boon Dhatf the grandfather of the worlds said “Choose a boon.” On hearing the sweet words of the creator, the Asura of undismayed intellect spoke thus. Hiranyakaiipu said:

16-17. “O creator, O lord of subjects, never may I have the fear of death from weapons, missiles, thunderbolts, dry trees, mountains, water, fire and onslaught of enemies gods, Daityas, sages, Siddhas or in fact from any living being created by you. Why should I expatiate on it? Let there be no death for me in heaven, on earth, in the day time, at night, from above or below, O lord of subjects!”

Sanatkumdra said:

18. On hearing these words of the Asura, the merciful lotus-born deity bowed to Visnu mentally and spoke “O lord of Daityas, I am delighted. Attain everything.

19. Stop your penance which has already run on to ninetysix thousand years. You have realised your desires entirely. Stand up. Rule over the kingdom of the Danavas.” On hearing these words, the Asura was pleased and beaming in his face.

20. He was coronated by Brahma the great grandfather of the worlds. He became inclined to destroy the three worlds. The highly elated Asuras disturbed all righteous activities and defeated all the gods in battle.

21. Then the terrified Indra and other gods harassed by him got the permission of Brahma and went to the milk ocean 292 where Visiju was lying.

22. Considering him the bestower of happiness, they propitiated and eulogised Visnu with various hymns. When he was pleased they told him their woeful tale.

23-24. On learning their misery in entirety, Visnu, the delighted lord of Lak?ml granted them boons, Getting up from his couch, Visnu consoled the gods and the sages by means of different words befitting himself. The lord as

refulgent as the fire said—"O leading gods, I shall kill the Daitya with force. Return to your own abodes fully assured, all of you”.

25. O great sage, on hearing the words of Vis^u, Indra and other leading gods, fully assured and satisfied, went to their abodes thinking that the younger brother Hiranyak?a was already killed.

26-27. The noble soul Visnu assumed the form partly of lion and partly of man. His head was matted and full of manes. Sharp fangs were his weapons. The claws were keen and pointed. The snout was finely shaped. The mouth was wide open. The body was terrible and refulgent like a crore of suns, blazing and powerful like the fire at the time of dissolution. He was identical with the universe. More words need not be used to describe him. When the sun was about to set, the lord went to the city of the Asuras.

28. The Man-lion fought with the powerful Daityas. He killed many of them. He held them up and whirled. Exhibiting wonderful prowess he smashed and crushed the various Asuras.

29. On seeing that omniformed lion, the son of the lord of Daityas, Prahlada, said to the king, his father. Prahlada said:

“Is it the universe-formed lord who has come as the majestic lion?

30. The infinite lord in the form of Man-lion has come within your city. Desist from fight and seek refuge in him. I see the terrible form of the lion.

31. Since there is none to fight him in all the three worlds, it is better that you submit to him and continue to be the ruler.”

2QO. Though son of the Asura Hiran>akaiipu, Prahlada was an ardent devotee of Vi»u. He had to suffer much at the hands of his father for devotion to Visnu. It was to avenge Prahlada that Visnu incarnated as the man-lion and killed Hiran>akas»pu.

aqa. The story relates to Hiran>akasipu the younger brother of Hiranyftksa. Hiran>akasipu was proud of his prowess and as blessed by Siva, could not be killed in an ordinary way. He struck terror in the heart of the gods whom he had ousted from their vantage positions. He was killed by Visnu assuming the form of Man-lion.

“O On hearing the words of his son, the wicked Asura said son, why are you so afraid?”

32. Thus addressing son, the king of Daityas ordered the heroes among his Daityas—“O ye the catch the heroes, hold of this lion of hideous brows and eyes.”

33. At his behest the leading Daityas who desired to catch the lion approached him hut they were burnt in a trice like the moths in the blazing fire attracted by its colour.

34. When the Daityas were burnt the king himself fought with the lion with all kinds of weapons, missiles, spears swords, nooses, goads, fire and the like.

35. O VySsa, a day according to the calculation of Brahma 295 passed by even as they fought with weapons in their hands, roaring heroically and furiously at each other.

36. Then suddenly the Daitya assumed many arms holding weapons. He looked angrily at the fighting man-lion and pounced upon him in a rush.

37. Then after a terrific battle fought by all sorts of weapons and missiles they were exhausted. Then the great Daitya himself seized up a spear and rushed at the man-lion.

38. He was seized by the lord of beasts with hands as powerful as mountains. He was placed on the knee, tom and scratched in the chest by the claws piercing every vulnerable joint in the body.

39. His heart lacerated by his claws was filled with blood. He lay dead like a log of wood, his limbs being reduced to powder.

40. When he was killed, the heroic Visnu was pleased. He beckoned to Prahlada who bowed to him. He crowned him king and then left for his abode that could not even be imagined.

41. Then the gods were delighted. They bowed to lord Vi$nu who had finished their task and who deserved worship, O Brahmin. Thereafter Brahma and others returned to their abodes.

42. Thus incidentally, I have narrated to you the

# Rudrasarhhitd

story of Andhaka’s birth from Rudra, the death of Hiranyaksa at the hands of the Boar, the annihilation of his brother Hiranyakasipu by the Man-lion and the coronation of Prahlada. O foremost of brahmins, now listen to the prowess of Andhaka secured from the creator, his fight with Siva and his acquisition afterwards of the leadership of the Ganas.

# CHAPTER FORTYFOUR

# (Andhaka's attainment of the leadership of Ganas)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. Once Andhaka, the son of Hiranyaksa, was addressed jokingly by his haughty cousins in the course of their sports and games—'“O blind fellow, what will you do with kingdom?
2. Hiranyaksa was a fool who adopted you as son who are bereft of eyesight, fond of quarrel, ugly and hideous, after propitiating Siva by means of severe penances.
3. You cannot lay claim to the kingdom. Can a person other than the son of a king ever aspire for the kingdom? You yourself can ponder over it. At the most we can give you some share.”

Sanatkumdra said:

On hearing their words Andhaka was distressed. He thought over the matter intelligently. He then appeased his cousins with various words. In the night he went to a desolate forest.
For ten thousand years he performed a severe penance, repeating mantras. He stood on one leg, observed fast and lifted up his arms continuously. In short, he performed a penance that no god or Asura could do.
Every day he cut a piece of flesh and consigned it to the sacred blazing fire along with his blood repeating the mantras all along. This he continued for a year.

The Asuras performed austere penance to acquire power. Sometimes these were accompanied by the sacrifice of their flesh and blood in the fire. Such practices had almost become a code with the Asuras.

7. In the end only the bones and the nerves were left. The entire blood was exhausted. When there remained no flesh to offer he desired to offer his whole body into the fire.

8. Then he was seen by the heaven-dwellers, all of whom became frightened and bewildered. Then Brahma the creator was immediately propitiated and eulogised by the gods.

9. Brahma stopped him and said—“O Danava, choose a boon. Whatever is inaccessible in the universe, if you desire it, you can have it.”

10. On hearing the words of Brahma, the Daitya piteously bowed to him and said—“May Prahlada and others who have cruelly usurped my share in the kingdom be my slaves.

11. I am now blind but let me be endowed with divine vision. Let Indra and others pay me tax and tribute. Let no death come to me from gods, Daityas, Gandharvas, Yaksas, serpents or human beings.

12. Nor shall I meet with death from Narayana, the enemy of leading Daityas, or from the omniscient and omni-formed Siva.”

On hearing these words of the demon, Brahma became suspicious. He told him:

Brahma said:

13. “O leader of Daityas, whatever you ask shall take place. But accept some cause of death because none who is born or who will be born can escape the jaws of death.

14. Good men like you should rather avoid too long a life.”

On hearing these pleading words from Brahma, the Daitya said again.

Andhaka said:

15. “The most excellent of the ladies in the world for all time whether of mature, middle or young age shall be like a mother unto me.

16. She may be the rarest in the world, O unapproachable to all men, bodily, mentally or verbally, self-born.

lord, should I covet her, let destruction befall me instantaneously depriving me of the position of the ruler.

He 17. On hearing these words, Brahma was surprised. remembered the lotus like feet of Siva. After receiving the directive from him, he spoke to Andhaka.

Brahma said:

18. “O leader of ODaityas, whatever you desire shall necessarily be realised. king of Daityas, stand up. Realise your ambition. But always fight with heroic persons.”

19. O great sage, after listening to these words of the creator, and immediately bowing to him with devotion, the son of Hiranyakfa who had but sinews and bones left spoke to the lord.

20. “O lord, how can I enter the hosts of the enemy with this body and fight? Make me who am merely a skeleton with sinews left endowed with flesh. Touch me now with your holy hand.”

Sanatkumdra said:

21. On hearing his words Brahma touched his body with his hand and returned to his abode accompanied by the great gods and worshipped by the sages and Siddhas.

22. The moment he was touched, he became full bodied and strong. With eyes regaining sight he became beautiful and stout. Thus he entered his city.

23. Considering him blessed with the boon, on his arrival Prahlada and other leading Danavas surrendered the entire kingdom to him and became his slaves.

24. Then Andhaka went to the heaven to conquer it accompanied by his army and attendants. After defeating the gods in battle he made Indra pay him tribute.

25. He conquered the Nagas, Suparnas, Rak$asas, Gandharvas, Yaksas, human beings, and became the lord of mountains, trees and quadrupeds such as lions etc. by his force.

26-27. He made the universe including the mobile and immobile beings subservient to him. He acquired thousands of women beautiful in appearance amiable and faithful. He was accompanied by beautiful women of the

nether regions 2* 7 and of Earth and heaven. 288 He indulged with them in sexual dalliance on the beautiful banks of the rivers, mountains and other places.

28. Sporting about in their midst joyously, he drank divine and superhuman beverages left over by them and became highly elated.

29. He enjoyed among other excellent things, divine juices, fruits, fragrant flowers, fine conveyances very pleasant to drive in and excellent mansions erected by Maya.

30. Thus indulging in sports he passed ten thousand years beautified and rendered pleasant and mysteriously wonderful by means of flowers, incenses, unguents and dietary stuffs.

31. He did not know what would be auspicious and beneficent to him in the other world. He was deluded, blinded by pride and spoiled by his association with the wicked.

32. The haughty fellow attacked leading scholars by using fallacious arguments. Posing as a great soul he roamed about with his Daitya friends destroying Vedic rites.

33. Proud of his affluence he slighted the Vedas, gods and preceptors. He continued to indulge in sports, thereby reducing his longevity in a few days.

34. Then many crores of years passed by. Once, roaming about on the Earth with his army, he joyously went to the Mandara mountain.

35. The haughty demon roamed there along with his armies admiring its golden splendour. Having gone there ostensibly for some sport and pastime he finally resolved to stay there as destiny would have it.

36. He built a wonderful stable and auspicious city on the ridges of the Mandara and forced people to settle there gradually.

37. His three ministers Duryodhana, Vaidhasa and

Hasti once saw a beautiful woman in an excellent spot on the mountain.

38. They hastened to their lord joyously and lovingly told him what they had seen there.

The ministers said:

39. O lord of Daityas, in a mountain cavern we have seen a certain sage. His eyes are closed in meditation. He is handsome. The crescent moon adorns his head. He is wearing an elephant hide round his hips.

40. Serpents twine round his body. A necklace of skulls adorns his neck. His hair is matted. He holds a trident in his hand. He has arrows and quiver. He is a great archer. He displays a rosary.

41. He wields a sword. He holds a trident and a staff. This fair-complexioned four-armed sage of matted hair has smeared ashes over his body. His splendour is dazzling and his dress and features are wonderful.

42. Not far from him, another person was seen. He has simian features, very terrible in face and demeanour. Equipped with weapons his hands are rough and brawny. He is the guard on duty. There is a white bull, too old but firm and steady.

43. A woman of very auspicious features, young and beautiful was seen at the side of that sage. She is a gem under the sun.

44. She is richly bedecked in corals, pearls, jewels, gold gems and is dressed neatly. Her necklaces are fine and auspicious. He who has seen her can alone be called a man of sight. Of what awaits the sight of anything else?

45. O lord of Daityas, enjoyer of good jewels, that divine lady, wife and the beloved of that meritorious sage, is worthy of being seen and fetched here.

Sanatkumdra said:

46. On hearing their words, the Daitya became lustful. He shook with excitement. Immediately he sent Duryodhana and others to the sage.

47. O great sage, those excellent ministers well versed in statesmanship approached the inscrutable sage of exalted.

# Sivapur&#x26;na

After bowing they conveyed to him the behest of the Daitya.

The ministers said:

48. “Andhaka the noble soul, son of Hiranyak$a, the king of Daityas, the emperor of the three worlds, is camping here now at the instance of Brahma and is sportively inclined.

49. O great sage, we are his ministers possessed of great prowess. We have come to you at his behest. Listen with attention to what he says.

50. Whose son are you? O great sage, O intelligent one, why are you stationed here in a carefree manner? Whose wife is this young beautiful lady? O great sage, this auspicious lady be given to the lord of Daityas.

51. Where this body of yours smeared with ashes, bedecked with necklaces of skulls and hideous in appearance! Why do you keep the quiver, the bow, the arrows, the sword, the missile BhuSuncji, the trident, the thunderbolt and the iron club?

52. Where this sacred Ganga, this crescent moon, the matted hair, these pieces of bones from the corpse, the serpent with poisonous breath and protruding mouth, and where the close embrace of the lady of plump bosom!

53. Riding on a bull is despicable. No man on earth has seen such a thing. Bowing and kneeling is a virtue in some places. Why is this diet contrary to the way of the world?

54. Surrender your wife unto me peacefully. O foolish fellow, why do you perform your penance in the company of a lady? It is improper and it does not behove you. I am the lord of jewels in the three worlds (It may suit me).

55. Leave off your weapons, at my behest and carry on your penance. If my order is transgressed you will have to pay dearly with this very body.”

56. Lord Siva following the worldly convention considered Andhaka a leader of wicked men. On hearing the words of the emissaries he spoke smilingly.

# Rudrasashhiid

Siva said:

57. If I am £iva what do you gain from me? Why do you utter false things. O lord of Daityas, listen to my prowess. It is improper on your part to speak like this.

58. I do not remember any father of mine. Ignorant and hideous that I am; I do not know my mother. In a cavern I am performing this severe Padupata rite, the like of which none has yet performed.

59. This is well known that I have no root. I cannot get rid of all these things. This wife of mine is young and beautiful. She bears everything patiently. She is the achievement of one that has gone everywhere.

60. O Raksasa, whatever appeals to you at present you can take.

After saying this, Siva who wore the garb of an ascetic stopped, and stood quiet.

Sanatkumdra said:

61. On hearing his profound words, the Danavas bowed to him and returned Andhaka who had taken a bow to destroy the three worlds.

62. The ministers of unafflicted disposition bowed to their haughty king and shouted cries of victory narrating everything that Siva had smilingly told him. Then they commented as follows.

The Ministers said:

301. Where (on earth) is a Nisacara seen to be fickle in heroism and courage? Where is a Danava miserable and powerless? Where does a ruthless, ungrateful and sinful Danava become afraid of death?

299. Pasupata or Mahftpasupata was a terrible form of penance that Siva undertook to regain his lost power. The performance required a complete concentration of the mind for achieving the end, hence P&#x26;rvati was kept away from the scene of his penance, under the care of Viraka, in the cave of the Mandara mountain (See also verses 11-12 of the next chapter). In giving the message Siva addresses Andbaka as R&#x26;ksaaa who

300. Danava, Danya or Asura. A veiled contemptuousness is intended to be conveyed by the word in the present context.

301. The Verses 64-67 though spoken by the ministers contain the substance of Siva’s message to the Asuia Andhaka. The message is full of irony and bespeaks the courage and self-confidence of the speaker.

# 64.

O king, you are the emperor of all the Daityas. You have been mockingly disparaged by the sage, a pitiable penance-monger. Indeed he considers the three worlds insignificant by his poor understanding. He has Viraka as his bodyguard whom he thinks to be very strong.

# 65.

“Where am I? Where are the terrible weapons? Where is the fight that terrifies even Death? Where is this Viraka of Simian facial features? Where is this NiSacara (night-stalker) senile and rickety in limbs?

# 66.

Where is this hideous man? Where is this unfortunate wretch? Where is your strength? Where are the spreading creeping plants? If you are mighty, attempt to fight with him. Come, do something.

Here we have weapons equal to thunderbolt, fierce and capable of destroying people like you. Where is your body as tender as lotus? Pondering over this do as you please.” O gentle lord of Danavas, these and similar words were uttered by that sage. O king, he says because he is proud and conceited. Is it not proper then to fight with him?

# 68.

If you are going to be enlightened by these words of no substance uttered by that sage and conveyed by us, you will think and act accordingly.

On hearing these words crooked and piercing yet professing to be true and beneficial the dull-witted (Danava) blazed furiously like fire sprinkled with clarified butter.

# CHAPTER FORTYFIVE

# ( The beginning of the war and the conversation with the messengers)

Sahatkumdra said:

1-3. Andhaka, the great Daitya king, deluded and smitten by Kama’s arrows drank wine and started from his palace. He walked like an elephant in rut. His eyes were roving. He was accompanied by many of his soldiers. He was fierce and walked majestically like heroes. He saw the cavern guarded by Viraka, standing at the entrance. He exhibited the characteristic reactions of a moth approaching a lamp and glancing at it eagerly and lovingly. Already the burning fire of passion had scorched him and therefore afflicting hits from Viraka had no effect on him.

4. He was attacked with stones, trees, thunderbolts, water, fire and serpents. He was threatened with weapons and missiles. He was afflicted by Viraka repeatedly but ineffectively and asked. “Who are you? Why have you come here?”

5. On hearing his words, Andhaka made no reply but began to fight Viraka when surprisingly and unbelievably he was defeated by Viraka in the battle.

6. When his sword was shattered to pieces he fled from the battlefield divested of his conceited pride. His throat was parched with hunger and thirst. He was aggrieved.

7. Prahlada and other important Daityas then fought with Viraka. Though they were terrible themselves they were defeated by hundreds of weapons. Finally their minds were held in check by the goad of shame.

8. Virocana, Bali, Bana, Sahasrabahu, Bhaji, Kujambha, Sambara, Vrtra and others of great valour, fought there.

9. These were defeated by the Gana Viraka in the course of the battle and split into two. At the end of the

When many Danavas were killed, the Ganas of Siddhas shouted “Victory.”

10-11. When packs of Jackals began to dance in the midst of the putrefying suets, fat and flesh, when beasts of prey, ghosts and spirits began to roam in the terrible slough of slushy blood, when the Daityas were smashed thus, the trident-bearing lord consoled Parvati and said.

Siva said:

“O beloved, formerly I had performed the great Vrata called Mahapa€upata.

12. The strength that I derived therefrom is exhausted whence this fall of the immortals at the hands of the mortals. O goddess, merit has declined due to the physical contact with you.

13. I will create a wonderfully divine and terrible forest and going there I shall perform still more severe vrata whereby, O beautiful lady, you shall be free from fear and sorrow.”

Sanatkumdra said:

14. After saying this, the noble soul went to a holy and terrible forest. He proclaimed loudly his intention and performed penance highly illuminated.

15. Siva performed penance for a thousand years the like of which could not be performed by the gods or Asuras. Parvati stayed behind in Mandara mountain awaiting for the return of the lord.

16. The chaste lady, endowed with good conduct remained alone in that cavern. She was terrified and distressed. Of course she was guarded by her son Viraka.

17. Then the Daitya whose mental steadiness had been shattered by the arrows of Kama, became bold and haughty due to the boons that had been granted to him. He came to the cavern accompanied by his soldiers.

18. Forsaking food, drink and sleep, the infuriated Daitya accompanied by his army fought with Viraka a very wonderful battle for five hundred, five days and nights.

19-21. Various weapons were used by the Daityas: Swords, javelins, slings, maces, sharp missiles, arrows with

crescent-shaped tips, arrows with prolonged iron pikes, tortoise-shaped heads with blazing steel pointed hooks, sharp spear, axes, iron clubs of diverse sorts, iron balls, rocks, branches of trees and various divine missiles. Viraka was attacked with these weapons and he fainted at the entrance to the cavern. His body was pierced by the sharp weapons hurled by the Daityas. The various weapons barred the entrance to the cave.

22-23. Viraka was covered by the weapons and could not be extricated. The goddess Parvati was afraid at the sight. From within the cave she remembered Brahma and Vishnu.

24. Thus remembered by the goddess, Brahma, Vishnu, Indra and others assumed female forms and came there.

25. Sages of great dignity, Siddhas, Nagas and Guhyakas became women and entered the cavern where Parvati was staying.

26-27. Since it was not customary to enter the harem of kings they assumed female form of wonderful features and entered the cavern of Parvati for heroic activities.

28. Thundering sounds of clouds, as at the end of a Kalpa, were produced by these thousands of women. Drums were beaten and conches were blown.

29. Meanwhile Viraka of wonderfully fierce valour regained his consciousness and stood up. He seized the weapons of the warriors and hit the Daityas with them.

30. Brahmi stood opposed to the Daityas with the staff in her hand. Gauri became very furious. Narayani held conch, mace, sword, discus and bow in her hands.

31. Bidaujasi set out holding the thunderbolt and the handle of the ploughshare in her hand. Her complexion was golden. The sky constituted her forelocks. In her fierce velocity thousands of streams of current were let loose.

32. The goddess of thousand eyes, fought steadily in war, undaunted and invincible with hundreds of Daityas.

303. The Sakti or Energy of a god is represented as his female counterpart. Each energy is personified and functions individually. The Puripaa depict the gods and their Energies fighting against the Asuras. In fact the god and his Energy are identical. There is no characteristic mark distinguishing the two.

On seeing this limitless vast army, the Daityas were bewildered, pale in the face, excited and dismayed, frightened and dejected in the heart.

# 38.

All these celestial damsels, the chief of whom was Brahma€akti and the general Vlraka of terrible valour pacified the mind of Parvati, the daughter of the lord of mountains and assured her.

The important ones among the Daityas and others who possessed strength derived from the boons granted to them, thought, in their minds, of their death or retreat and fought an unprecedented great battle with the ladies.

Making Vlraka of terrible valour and wonderful intellect, her general, Parvati fought a wonderful battle in the company of her friends and allies.

Thinking upon Visnu and looking towards the southern direction the Daitya king, the heroic son of Hiranyak$a, quickly made a fierce array of soldiers with Gila at the head.

He made the frontal array terrific by the force of regular service. By the time this was done, the infuriated lord came there. Clad in hides he had the lustre of a thousand fiery suns at the end of a Kalpa.

# 43-44.

On seeing lord Siva arrived after the lapse of a thousand years, the delighted women in the company of Vlraka fought a very great battle. Parvati bowed her head to Siva. She exhibited great valour to her lord. The delighted Parvati fought.

45. Then the Asura chief, very clever in statesmanship, unable to see either Parvatl or Siva sent his emissary Vighasa immediately to Siva.

46. He was one whose limos were shattered by the weapons hurled by the gods and the Ganas. He entered the cavern, bowed to Siva and spoke these words haughtily. The messenger said:

47. “I have been sent by him and so I have entered this cavern. You have nothing to do with a woman. Surrender this young and beautiful lady.

48. Usually you are an ascetic. Carry on that. Thinking ‘Should a sage be offended?’ I have observed forbearance within my tender mind. But O sage, you are not a real ascetic but only my enemy.

49. You are extremely inimical to the Daityas. Show your might in fighting with me. O wicked ascetic, I shall send you to Yama’s abode befitting the nether worlds.”

SanatkumSra said:

50. On hearing these words conveyed by the emissary, the great three-eyed lord, the goal of the good, the destroyer of the pride of the wicked, the wearer of skull-garlands spoke furiously burning with grief.

Siva said:

51. Manifestly your words are fierce. Hence hasten. Fight with me if you have the might.

52. Of what avail are the wives and riches, be they ever so beautiful, to a feeble man in the world? Let the haughty Daityas proud of their strength come. I have already thought of this and acted accordingly.

1-2. The king of Daityas, skilled in interpreting what he hinted at, seized his mace and hastened along with his army to the entrance of the cavern. The terrible demon Gila who could not be overwhelmed even by the foremost among the gods, was placed ahead. After reaching the cavern of the lord Siva, the Daitya attacked with his weapons as refulgent as thunderbolt. The others showered weapons on Viraka and yet others on Parvati, the daughter of the mountain.

3-8. Some smashed the beautiful entrance, some destroyed the flowers, leaves, fruits and roots, the hearty water sheds and the garden paths. A few stirred up joyously the sunny peaks of the mountain. Then Siva collected his army. The infuriated trident-bearing deity called them together, the terrible living beings, the gods with their armies including Visnu and others. Immediately after being called, the gods came to Siva and stood near him with palms joined in reverence. They came with chariots, elephants, horses, bulls, cows, camels, mules, excellent birds, lions, bhutas, tigers, deer, boars, Sarasa birds, fishes, crocodiles, other living beings, scattered flies, serpents rending cremation grounds along with ghosts and spirits, divine chariots, lakes, rivers and mountains.

9. When the gods had taken adequate rest along with their vehicles, the trident-bearing lord Siva sent them to the battle ground with the steady and chief resolve on victory.

Yugas had come but they were all devoured in the battlefield angrily.

11. In a trice all of them including Brahma, Indra, Visnu, the sun and the moon were swallowed by Vighasa. When the armies were devoured, only Viraka was left behind.

12. Leaving off the battle front Viraka entered the cavern, bowed to Siva. The eloquent but distressed Viraka then acquainted the destroyer of Kama with all the details.

13. O lord, your army has been devoured by the Daitya Vighasa. Visnu, the preceptor and elder to the three worlds and the destroyer of Daityas, has been devoured. The moon and the sun, Brahma and Indra, the bestower of boons, have been devoured. All these, Yama, Varuna, Vayu and Kubera have been devoured.

14. I, the humble one, alone am left behind. What is it that I have to do now? The lord of Daityas along with the Daityas is invincible and hence rejoiced.

15. Visnu the lord who became invincible after tearing off Hiranyakasipu the son of KaSyapa with his claws, had the speed of wind and a terrifying demeanour. He opened his mouth wide and began to blow of the three worlds although the lord was subservient to the good.

When the matter stood thus, he was cursed by the seven

Then they were requested by Visnu through

When swallowed by Vighasa with wide open mouth, you shall stabilise yourself in the Badari forest in the holy residence of Siva, the cavern and shall then be freed from sins.” Thereafter in accordance with the curse of the sages he roams everyday in the battleground, very hungry and swallows the Daityas and becomes delighted.

SanatkumSra said:

# 21.

On hearing this from his excellent son, the lord of Pramathas, the lord of the three worlds meditated for a long time. He performed an incomparable miracle by chanting Saman songs. He laughed assuming a body as resplendent as the sun and thereby dispelled the darkness.

# 22-24.

When the light spread, the sage Viraka fought again with the Daityas of deformed features. He who was created by the excellent sage after swallowing powdered rock and who had fought the battle and even conquered the Pura Asura previously was immediately swallowed by the Daitya together with Nandin who carried sharp arrows, spear and swords, who was the chief of warriors and hundreds of excellent sages, the great receptacle of lores, possessed of mental and physical restraint and great courage. On seeing this, lord Siva got on to his bull and faced the Daitya Vighasa. Repeating the divine Mantra that compels the disgorging of what is swallowed, he stood there keeping the bow in readiness and the arrows as powerful as thunderbolts.

# 25.

Then the sage Viraka came out of the mouth of Vighasa accompanied by Vi?nu and his army. The lotus born Brahma, Indra—the enemy of Bala, the moon and the sun were also disgorged. Thus disgorged the delighted army fought a great battle again.

Thus 0 army was the of the Daityas conquered. But Sukra revived the Daityas slain in the battle by the virtue of his 'science. The preceptor of Dlnavas was then bound like an animal and brought by the Ganas before Lord Siva, the destroyer of Tripuras, who swallowed him.

When the battle ground was strewn with plenty of Bhutas who eagerly devoured mouthfuls of the corpses of the Daityas, with headless trunks dancing holding sharp arrows and spears in their hands, with intoxicated Vetalas, with birds of firm claws and beaks and with wolves their jaws filled with dead bodies; the founder of the family Hiranyakaiipu fought the battle for a long time and was defeated by Vi?nu, Siva and Indra.

# 29.

When the exhausted army entered the nether worlds, nooks and corners in hills and seas, Andhaka the foremost of the Daityas who in his height of fury had harassed the gods and who could split the universe was divested of his haughtiness by Vi?nu by terrible blows from his mace.

# 30.

Since he had secured boons he did not leave the battle ground although his body had been afflicted much by the lord of the gods by terrible blows and hits. Then by means of weapons and missiles, trees, mountains and waters he defeated the gods. Then he challenged the lord of Pramathas roaring loudly.

# 31.

Fighting steadily by means of various weapons that fell on the battle ground, they were exhausted. Then the Asura inflicted pain on Parvati and Siva by means of uprooted trees, serpents, thunderbolts and other weapons and by indulging in deceptive practices.

# 32.

In order to conquer Siva, the Daitya of as great strength and intelligence as the destroyer of Tripuras, created another juggler, a cheat. The Daitya whose madness had helplessly been aggravated by hundreds of boons, could not be killed by the gods, though his body had been shattered by plenty of weapons and missiles.

Many Andhakas originating from the exudations of his body, with hideous faces resembling his, pervaded the surface of the earth. He was terribly pierced with the Trident by Siva, the enemy of the Tripuras, the lord of Bhutas whose body blazed like fire at the end of a Kalpa.

35. It had a very terrible and hard aspect characterised by several arms. Angrily the lord Visnu projected from the wings of the army and stood ahead of the Ganas.

36. The goddess stood high in the battle field covering up the entire ground by her pair of feet. She was eulogised by the gods. Induced by the lord, the hungry female form devoured the army, drank the hot blood of the Daityas and made the battle ground marshy.

37. Then, only the chief of the Daityas was left. Still he fought on with Siva, beating terribly with his palms, knees, legs, nails, face, arms and head. Although his blood had been sucked dry he remembered the traditional heroism of his race.*07

38. Afterwards he was quietened by the lord of Pramathas. His heart was pierced. He was staked to the trident. He was held aloft in the sky like a long pole. Half of his body, the lower one, was dried up by the rays of the sun. The other half was drenched by clouds attended with gusts of wind and heavy downpour. His body was subjected to all sorts of torture.

39. Shattered and scattered like flakes of snow in the rays of the sun, his limbs were torn asunder. Yet the foremost of the Daityas did not die. He eulogised Siva. The delighted Siva, ocean of great mercy, joyously gave him the position of the chieftain of his Ganas.

40. The lords of the worlds worshipped the lord of Pramathas, at the end of war, with different hymns pleasing and significant. Visnu, Brahma and others too eulogised him with stooping shoulders. They were delighted and happy and shouted cries of victory.

41. Siva spent the time rejoicingly in the mountain cavern in their company. Honouring the great and excellent mountains by the bestowal of gifts he dismissed a few of his AmSas (parts). Regaining the delighted daughter of the lord.

Vyasa said:

1. This has been succinctly heard by me that in the great terrible battle that caused horripilation, Sukra the wise lord of the Daityas was swallowed by Siva, the enemy of the Tripuras. Please narrate in detail what that great Yogin, stationed in the stomach of the trident-bearing lord Siva did.
2. How was it that the gastric fire of Siva, that terrible fire of dissolution at the end of Kalpa did not burn Sukra? How did the intelligent Sukra of bright refulgence, come out of the stomach of Siva? How long and in what manner did Sukra propitiate him?
3. How did he obtain that great knowledge that suppresses death? O dear one, what is that knowledge which prevents death?
4. O sage, how did Andhaka get the position of the chieftain of Ganas after being released from the trident of Siva, the lord of the gods, indulging in divine sports?
5. O highly intelligent one, please be merciful. Mention all these sweet sports entirely to me who listen with attention.

Brahma said:

On hearing these words of Vyasa of immeasurable refulgence, Sanatkumara remembered the lotus-like feet of Siva and said.

Sanatkumara said:

O Vyasa of great intellect, listen to the nectar-like sport of Siva. You are the foremost of devotees of Siva and you delight me.

10-11. When the battle began between Siva and Andhaka, the leaders who had formed their armies in the unpiercing arrays of thunderbolt and the mountain, the powerful Daityas became victorious at first but O sage, by the power of Siva, the Pramathas became victorious afterwards.

12. On hearing that the Asura Andhaka was dejected. He began to think “How can I be victorious?”

13. Going away from the battle ground the heroic and intelligent Andhaka went immediately to Sukra, unattended by anyone else.

14. Getting down from his chariot, he bowed to his preceptor. He was foremost among the politicians, dered well and spoke with palms joined in reverence. Andhaka said:

15. O holy lord, after resorting to you we feel the respect due to a preceptor towards you. We are never vanquished. We are always victorious.

16. Due to our power we consider all the gods and their followers including Siva and Visiiu as insignificant as the useless blacks of grass.

17. Due to your blessings, the gods are afraid of us as the elephants of the lions and the serpents of Garucjas.

18. By smashing the entire host of the Pramathas, by your grace, the Daityas and the Danavas have entered the impenetrable thunderbolt Vyuha.

19. O Bhargava, by seeking refuge in you we roam about unhesitatingly in the battle ground, like the cows grazing in the field fearlessly.

20. But now the Asuras are harassed by the heroic enemy. They are killed. Save, save us O, Brahmin, who have sought refuge in you.

21. See HuijcJa and others, leading lieutenants of mine who have been slain or who have fallen. They have been attacked by Pramathas of terrible valour who can destroy even death.

23. O Bhargava, let all the Pramathas see the fruit of your lore as you will kindly resuscitate the Asuras by that lore.

Sanatkumdra said:

24. On hearing the words of Andbaka, the perplexed Bhargava began to reflect sadly.

25. “What shall I do? What will benefit me? Any living being has various activities to be performed. It may seem improper to me.

26. This VidyS has been derived from Siva and I am going to use it on the heroes suppressed by the heroic Pramathas, the followers of Siva.

27. It is my duty to protect those who seek refuge in me.” After thinking like this, the proposal of Andhaka was accepted by Sukra.

28. Smiling slightly and thinking upon the lotus like feet of Siva with a peaceful mind, Bhargava spoke to the ruler of Danavas.

Sukra said:

29. O dear, what has been mentioned by you is entirely true. I have acquired this lore just for the welfare of the Danavas.

30. Drinking the unbearable smoke of husks or eating bits of grains for a thousand years, this lore has been acquired from Siva. It is pleasing and beneficent to you my kinsmen.

31. With this lore, I shall revive the Daityas destroyed in the battle by the Pramathas just like the cloud that revives scorched plants.

32. Within a Muhurta you will see these Daityas as if waking from sleep, healed from wounds, devoid of pain and very healthy.

Sanatkumdra said:

33. After saying this to Andbaka, Sukra repeated the

1010 Sioapurdna mantra once for each of the Daityas after thinking upon lord Siva.

34. As soon as the mantra was repeated, the Daityas and Danavas rose up simultaneously as if from sleep, with the weapons lifted in their hands.

35. They rose up like the merit of men who give water to the thirsty during the fight or like charity given to brahmins at the time of distress in the spirit of faith.

36. On seeing Hunda and other Asuras revived to life, the Asuras shouted loudly like clouds laden with water,

37. Roaring with awful sounds the fearless valorous Asuras got ready to fight with Pramathas.

38. On seeing the Daityas and Danavas resuscitated to life by Sukra, Nandin and other Pramathas, very haughty and invincible were surprised.

39. After pondering they consulted one another “This activity shall be mentioned to Siva the lord of gods.”

40. When the sacrifice of war was going on like that, kindling the surprise of the leading Pramathas, Nandin, the son of Silada who was infuriated on seeing the work of Bhargava approached lord Siva.

41-42. After saying “Be victorious” to Siva—the cause of victory and golden-complexioned, Nandin said “O lord, the warlike activities of leading Ganas, which are difficult even for the gods including Indra, to perform, have been rendered futile by Bhargava. O lord, after repeating the lore that revives the dead to life, one for each, all the dead enemies have been playfully resuscitated.

43. The great Asuras, viz., Tuhunda, Huncja, Kumbha, Jambha, Vipaka, Paka and others have returned from Yama’s abode. They are routing the Pramathas and are roaming about.

44. O lord Siva, how can we be victorious if he were to revive to life all the Daityas killed by us, again and again? How can there be peace to the leading Gapas?

Nandin, the lord of leading Pramathas laughingly spoke to Nandin, the chief of all lords of Ganas. Siva said:

46. O Nandin, go very quickly and seize that great brahmin from the midst of the Daityas and bring him here like a vulture bringing the bird quail.

Sanatkumdra said:

47. Thus commanded by the bull-bannered deity Nandin bellowed like a bull and roared like a lion. Moving fast through the army he reached the place where the bright scion of the family of Bhargavas was sitting.

48. Harassing and exciting the Daityas, Nandin snatched off Sukra well guarded by all the Daityas who had in their hands, nooses, swords trees, boulders and mountains, like the mythological animal Sarabha snatching off an elephant.

49. The demons followed him roaring like lions to get him released even as his cloth became loose, his ornaments fell off and his tuft of hair got untied as he was caught tightly by the strong Nandin.

50. The leading Danavas showered on NandiSvara, thunderbolts, spears, swords, axes, staffs, discus and other missiles like clouds making a fierce downpour.

51. When the combat between the Asuras and gods deepened, the chief of Ganas burnt hundreds of the weapons of the enemy by the fire originating from his mouth and reached Siva taking Bhargava with him.

52. “O lord, here is Bhargava”, saying this he handed him over to Siva immediately. The lord of gods caught hold of Bhargava like a present offered by a devotee.

53. Without saying anything, the protector of the Bhutas, thrust Bhargava into his mouth like a fruit. The Asuras shouted loudly “Alas! Alas.”

Vy&#x26;sa said:

1. O Great sage, when Bhargava was swallowed by Rudra what did the heroic Danavas headed by Andhaka, do? Please narrate.

Sanalkumdra said:

2. When Bhargava was swallowed by the lord of Parvatl, the Daityas gave up hopes of victory, like lordly elephants bereft of trunks or cows and bulls devoid of horns.

3. They were as futile as headless trunks, as brahmins who have forsaken the study of the Vedas, as the living beings who have given up efforts and as the efforts of those who are not favoured by good fortune.

4. They were lustreless and ineffectual like women devoid of husbands, like the arrows devoid of feather, like longevity devoid of meritorious actions and like learning in the Vedas without the observance of sacred rites.

5. They were as powerless as innumerable activities rendered fruitless without the support of wealth, or as K^atriyas devoid of heroism or as the assemblage of virtue without truth.

6. When Bhargava was taken away by Nandin and swallowed by Siva as he had swallowed poison, the Daityas became grief-stricken and their pride and jubilation for battle became curbed.

7. On seeing Tuhugda, Huruja and other Daityas, devoid of enthusiasm, the courageous and valorous Andhaka replied.

Andhaka said:

8. By seizing Bhargava forcibly from our midst we have been duped by Nandin. Our bodies have been rendered lifeless.

9. With the taking away of Bhargava from us, our

10. Fie upon us by whom the sole and excellent preceptor of the family worthy of the respect of the whole race, the virtual protector of all of us and very efficient, has not been saved at the time of adversity.

11. Hence do not waste time. Fight with the enemy, the heroic Pramathas, after remembering the lotus-like feet of the preceptor.

12. After remembering the beneficent lotus-like feet of the preceptor, I shall slay all the Pramathas along with Nandin.

13. After killing these along with the gods including Indra I shall obtain the release of Bhargava like the Yogin who releases the soul from the bondage of action.

14. Bhargava too is a lordly Yogin. If he himself comes out of Siva’s body, the rest of us are saved.

Sanatkumdxa said:

15. On hearing the words of Andhaka, the powerful Danavas, fearlessly roaring like the rumbling clouds, spoke after resolving to do what was then to be thought of.

The Danavas said:

16. 'If we are destined to live, the Pramathas cannot overwhelm us. If it is otherwise what avails running from the battle ground leaving our master behind.

17. Those who leave their masters and run away professing to be honoured and desiring to be rich will surely fall into hell Andhatamisra.

18. After sullying their fame with the darkness of ignominy they will forfeit their pleasure both here and here-after. They will be slain in the battle.

with them, those Daityas and Danavas pounded the Pramathas in the battle. They sounded the war-drums.

21-22. By means of arrows, swords, thunderbolts, hard rocks, Bhusun^is, Bhindipalas and other missiles, spears, javelins, axes, skull-headed clubs, tridents, maces, staffs and other weapons they bit one another and wrought a great havoc.

23. There was a great noise everywhere, produced by the drawn bows, flying arrows, the missiles, Bhusundis, Bhindipalas and leonine roars.

24. There was great tumult caused by the war drums, trumpets, the trumpeting sounds of elephants and the neighing sounds of the horses.

25. The vast space between heaven and earth was filled with loud reports causing horripilations to the courageous as well as the cowardly.

26-27. The thirsty armies on either side fainted with their ears bursting by the loud sounds of elephants and horses, with the flagstaff and banners broken and torn, with their weapons exhausted, vomiting diverse kinds of blood and bereft of horses, elephants and chariots.

28. O sage, the heroic Nandin and other Pramathas slew all Asuras and won the victory.

29. On seeing his army being shattered here and there Andhaka rushed at the Ganas driving in his chariot.

30. Like the mountains hit with the thunderbolt by Indra, the Pramathas perished. Like the clouds devoid of water they sank low.

31. Glancing at the in-coming or out-going Pramathas, far off or at close quarters, Andhaka hit them severally with as many arrows as the hair on their bodies.

32-33. On seeing the army shattered and smashed by the powerful Andhaka, Skanda, Vinayaka, Nandin, Somanandin and other heroic and powerful Pramathas, and Siva’s personal Ganas became furious and fought in diverse ways and very valorously.

34-35. By Vinayaka, Skanda, Nandin, Somanandin, VIraka, Naigameya, the powerful VaiSakha and other terrible Ganas, Andhaka was rendered blind as they showered tridents, spears and arrows incessantly.

Then a great tumult arose in the midst of the armies of Pramathas and Asuras. At that great noise, Bhargava who was within the belly of Siva began to wander seeking an outlet like the unaboded wind. In Siva’s body he observed seven worlds301 including Patala.

# 38.

He saw the diverse worlds of brahma, Visnu, Indra, Aditya and celestial damsels as well as the battle between the Pramathas and Asuras.

# 39.

Wandering round and round in the belly of Siva for a hundred years he failed to see any outlet as a wicked person fails to see a vulnerable point in a good person.

# 40-41.

Taking recourse to the Yoga of Siva he repeated the following mantra and assumed the form of Siva’s semen. He thus emerged out of the belly of Siva through his penis. Thereafter he bowed to Siva and was accepted as a son by Parvati. He was made a lord of the Ganas.

# 42.

On seeing Bhargava come out of the path of the semen, lord Siva, the storehouse of mercy, laughed and said.

Rudra, Isana, the bestower of boons and Siva. The Danava Andhaka meditating on these hundred and eight forms of the supreme soul became free from that great fear.

19. He was drenched with the divine shower of nectar by lord Siva who was perfectly satisfied. He was brought from the top of the trident and released.

20. He spoke to the Asura Andhaka, the great Daitya. The great lord forgave what the demon had done before. The great lord said:

21. O lord of Daityas, I am pleased by your restraints and observances, your valour and courage. O you of good rites, choose a boon.

22. Propitiated by you, I grant the boons. Free from sins, you deserve a boon, excellent Daitya.

23. For the merits you have acquired by retaining your life for three thousand years you shall attain happiness. Sanatkumdra said —

24. On hearing this, Andhaka joined his palms in reverence. He knelt on the ground and spoke to the lord consort of Parvati trembling with awe. Andhaka said:

25-26. O lord, what you had been told by me before was done with the words choked by excess of pleasure. You the greater than the greatest were addressed as an ordinary poor person. What had been done by me in the battlefield due to delusion was the most despicable in the world. It was because I did not realise you then. O lord, please do not keep that in mind.

27. O great lord, the wicked thing I committed towards Parvati was due to my base lust. It may kindly be forgiven. I am the most miserable and unhappy.

28. A miserable person shall be pitied. If he be in a pitiable plight, he shall be all the more treated kindly. I am miserable but always devoted to you.

29. “I am miserable and devoted. I have sought

refuge in you. I shall be saved. I have joined my palms in reverence.

30. May this goddess, the mother of the universe, be pleased with me. Let her leave off her anger entirely and glance at me delightedly.

31. O moon-crested lord, where is her anger and where am I a pitiable Daitya? O crescent-crested lord, O Siva, O supreme lord, I cannot bear it.

32. Where are you, the most liberal? Where am I the wretched, rendered helpless by passion, fury and faults by old age and death?

33. Let not your son Viraka, a powerful fighter and warrior, be angry on seeing me the miserable creature.

34. Let me see Oᴾᵃʳᵛᵃᵗⁱ always as mother with reverence due to elders, lord who are as white as snow, necklace, moon, conch and the Kunda flower.

35. Let me be always devoted to you both. Let me be free from enmity towards the gods. Let me be calm in heart and think of Yogic ways. Let me thus stay with your Ganas.

36. Let me not remember again the adverse qualities of the Danavas, thanks to your mercy, O lord. Please grant me this excellent boon.

Sanatkumara said:

37. After saying this, the lord of the Daityas became quiet meditating on the three-eyed lord and seeing Parvati as mother.

38. Then glanced at by Siva, with delighted eyes, he remembered the entire story of his previous wonderful birth.

39. When he remembered the incident his ambition was fulfilled. Bowing to mother and —Siva and Parvati—he became contented.

40. He was kissed and sniffed on the head by Parvati and Siva. From the crescent-crested lord Siva he secured everything he desired.

41. Thus I have narrated to you everything connected with the early story of Andhaka and his acquisition of the

Sanatkumara said:

1. O Vyasa, listen how the lore of warding off death was gained by the sage Bhargava from Siva who is called the conqueror of Death.
2. At first this scion of the family of Bhrgu went to the city of Varanasi and performed penance for a long time meditating on lord Bhairav.
3. There itself he fixed a phallic emblem of Siva, the great Atman. O Vedavyasa, in front of it, he dug a very beautiful well.
4. Assiduously he performed the ablutions of the lord of the gods for a hundred thousand times with Pancamrta using a Drona measure each time. Fragrant unguents he also used with them for the ablutions.
5. He offered sandal-paste and Yaksakardama to the lord of the gods, thousands of times. Gladly he smeared fragrant unguents on the phallic image.

1. He eulogised Siva with various hymns and repeated a thousand names. He sang songs of Siva’s glory. He danced and made offerings.
2. Sukra worshipped lord Siva in various ways for five thousand years.
3. When he did not see the lord, the least inclined to grant the boon, he took up still more unbearable and terrible observances and restraints.
4. He washed off the dirt of fickleness from his mind by the waters of pure conceptions many times as well as from the sense-organs. After purifying the gem of the mind, he offered the same to the trident-bearing lord. He drank the smoke of powdered husks or bits of grains or balls of iron-ash318 for a thousand years.
5. On seeing him performing the terrible penance thus by keeping the mind steady, lord Siva was delighted.
6. Coming out of the phallic image, lord Siva the consort of Daks&#x26;yanI appeared before him with a brighter refulgence than that of a thousand suns and said.

Lord Siva said:

“O great sage, O son of Bhrgu, O fortunate saint, by your perpetual penance I have been delighted.
O Bhargava, choose anything that you wish as your boon. I shall lovingly bestow on you all your desires. There is nothing that cannot be granted to you.”

Sanatkumdra said:

On hearing these pleasing words of Siva, Bhargava was very much delighted. He was immersed in the ocean of happiness.
The brahmin bowed to Siva with his eyes.

31. O soul-formed one, O Siva, this universe of the mobiles and immobiles is pervaded by these series of your forms. O eight-formed lord, having the form of the immanent soul, I always bow to you.

32. O kinsman of those devoid of kinsmen, O you of the form of universe, equipped with the eight forms, you make all expand. O lord, you make all objects available to those who bow to you. Hence I bow to you.

Sanatkumdra said:

33. Eulogising the eight formed Siva by reciting the eight verses, Bhargava touched the ground with his head and bowed again and again.

34-35. When he was eulogised by Bhargava of great brilliance, the great god stood up and lifted the brahmin from the ground where he was bowing to him. Holding him up, the lord spoke in a rumbling voice like that of the cloud but gentle in effect, illuminating the quarters with the moonlight-brilliance of his teeth.

The great lord said:

36-38. O excellent brahmin, O Bhargava, O dear, you are my faithful devotee. By your severe penance in this life, by the merit of installing my phallic image, and the adoration of it, by the offerings made with concentrated devotion, your unshaken purity and holy conduct in this Avimuktakjetra, I see you as my other two sons. There is nothing which cannot be given to you.

39. With this body you shall enter the cavity of my belly and you will be born as my son through my excellent organ—the penis.

40. I am giving you now the boon inaccessible to even my attendants and which I have kept away even from Vi?nu and Brahma usually.

317. The Avimukta-K?etra is the same as V&#x26;rftQasT region. It derives its name from the installation of the phallic emblem of Siva called Avimukteivara.

43. Whoever he may be if you were to repeat this mantra in respect of anyone he will truly return to life. This lore is the most excellent one.

Vyasa said:

1-2. O omniscient Sanatkumara, a wonderfully excellent story has been narrated with love and blessings by you. It is full of Siva’s benediction. I wish to know more of the story of the moon-crested lord wherein he gave the Asura Bana the position of the chieftain of his Ganas.

Sanatkumara said:

3. O Vyasa, listen with reverence to the story of Siva, the great Atman wherein it is explained how he bestowed the chieftainship of his Ganas on the Asura Bana.

4. Here is the good story of Siva, the great lord. Here too is the story of Siva’s fight with Krishna when the former blessed Bana.

5. Listen from me the most befitting and the highly meritorious legend of the sports of Siva. It is pleasing to the mind and to the ears.

6. Marici, the sage of great intellect, was the mentally created eldest son of Brahma. He was a Prajapati too.

7. His son Kasyapa was a noble soul. He was the most excellent of all sages. He made the creation flourish well. He was devoted to his father and to Brahma.

8. O Vyasa, thirteen daughters of Daksha were his wives. They were of good conduct and very faithful to their husband, the sage Kasyapa.

9. The eldest of the wives was Diti. The Daityas were her sons. The gods and others including the mobile and immobile beings were born to others.

10. The eldest Diti had the heroic sons Hiranyakashipu the elder and Hiranyaksa the younger.

11. Hiranyakashipu had four sons. They were in order Hrada, Anuhrada, Samhrada and Prahlada.

12. Prahlada was a great devotee of Vishnu. He had full control of his sense-organs. The Daityas were unable to destroy him.

14. His son was Bali who was a favourite of Siva and a liberal donor. The earth was given by him to Vi$nu who assumed the form of a dwarf.

15. His son Bana became a devotee of Siva. He was highly respected and intelligent. He was truthful and a liberal donor making thousands of charitable gifts.

16. Staying in the Sonita town18 he ruled over the three worlds after defeating several rulers forcefully.

17. As a result of the grace of Siva, the gods became the virtual servants of Bana, the devotee of Siva.

18-19. They were distressed by his enmity although he practised high virtues. In accompaniment of the instrumental music played by his thousand arms, by means of the Tantjava dance he propitiated Siva.

20. Siva favourably disposed to his devotees was highly delighted and satisfied by his dance and he glanced at him with sympathetic eyes.

21. The lord of the worlds, worthy of being sought refuge in, the bestower of the desires of the devotees asked the great demon, the son of Bali, to choose a boon he liked.

Siva said:

22. The great Dailya Bana, son of Bali, the foremost among the devotees and highly intelligent, bowed to lord Siva with devotion and eulogised him.

The Asura Bana said:

23-24. O great god, lord of the gods, favourably disposed to those who seek refuge in you, O great Siva, if you are pleased with me, be my guardian for ever. Be present with me as the lord of my city along with your sons and Ganas. O lord, be delightful to me in every respect.

Sanatkumara said :

25-26. Bana son of Bali, deluded by Siva’s deception, did not request anything else from lord Siva who would have bestowed even salvation if asked though he is hard to please. Siva, who is favourably disposed to his devotees, granted boons to him and stayed there lovingly along with his sons and his Ganas.

27. Once Siva performed divine sports in Sonita, the beautiful city of Bana, in the company of the gods and Asuras, on the banks of a river.

28. The Gandharvas and the celestial damsels danced and laughed. The sages performed Japas, bowed to, worshipped and eulogised him.

29. The Pramathas jumped and shouted; the sages performed sacrifices. The groups of Siddhas came and saw the divine sport of Siva.

30. Mlecchas, adversaries and evil-intentioned wranglers perished. The mothers (Brahmi etc.) sat facing him. The terrifying imps perished.

31. The worldly faults of those who had the good conception of devotion to Siva were forgotten.

32. The sages and the Siddhas leapt and bounced on seeing the activities of the women. The seasons displayed their power and nourished it.

33. Gentle winds blew wafting the grey pollen dust. The flocks of birds eager after honey chirped on the trees.

34. The cuckoo cooed sweetly in the forests and parks, generating love, on the branches heavily laden with flowers.

35. Then being glanced at by Kama who was not vanquished, the crescent-crested lord Siva highly indulgent in sports spoke to Nandin.

319. Mlecchas were wild ferocious tribes whose acts of violence caused vast devastations and destructions, struck terror in the social life of the country. They are said to have been repulsed and destroyed by lord Siva.

320. Mitrs are the divine mothers or personified energies of the principal deities reckoned variously as seven, eight, nine or sixteen in numbers. They are closely connected with the worship of Siva and are described as attending on his son Karttikeya to whom at first only seven Matrs were assigned.

Sanatkumdra said: O excellent sage, then, at his importunity, Parvati, devoted to her husband, began to bedeck herself ardently.

“I am coming. You return and so inform the lord at my bidding.” The Nandin approached Siva with the velocity of mind.

Siva who was extremely agitated told Nandin again. “Dear, go again and fetch Parvati from there.”

# 42.

“Yes, sir,” said he. He went to Parvati of sweet appearance and said: “Your lord wishes to see you beautifully and gorgeously dressed.”

O goddess, Siva is eagerly waiting for various sports. Daughter of the mountain, please go since the lord is distressed with passion.

All the celestial damsels told one another— “Since lord Siva is very eager to see Parvati being passionate, the lady whom this enemy of Kama may woo will certainly be the queen of celestial damsels.

Just as Viṣnu, by taking recourse to his yogic powers assumed the form of Enchantress (Mohini).

On seeing the change of form of Urvaśī, Ghrtacī adopted the form of Kali and Viśvaci that of Caṇḍika.

Oṣa, daughter of the Asura Bana efficient in divine Yoga, assumed the wonderfully auspicious and divine form of Parvati.

# 55.

Her feet were of excellent lustre. They shone like the great red lotus. They had all the divine characteristics bestowing every desired object.

# 56.

Knowing that she wanted to indulge in love-sport with Siva, the omniscient and omnipresent Parvati spoke. Parvati said—

O friend Oṣa, chaste and honourable lady since you have adopted my form out of passion, so you will have the monthly course in the appropriate time in the Karttika month. On the twelfth day in the bright half of Vaiśakha, you will undertake a fast. During the night while you are asleep in the harem, a man will come there and enjoy you. He has been made your husband by the gods. You will sport with him.

# 60.

This is because you have been devoted to Viṣnu ever since childhood without sinking into lethargy. She then mumbled to herself. “Let it be so” and was very bashful.

1. Listen to another story of Siva the great soul which bestows the highest pleasure and wherein his endearment to his devotees can be seen.

2-3. Formerly the Asura Bana had pleased Siva by performing the Tantjava dance. By adverse fate he became haughty. On realising that Siva, the lover of Parvati, was delighted in mind, the Asura Bana joined his palms in reverence, bent his shoulders and spoke.

Bana said:

4. O great god, lord of the gods and crest-jewel of all the gods, I am very strong, thanks to your favour.

5. A thousand hands have been given to me by you. They are only a burden to me, since except you I do not find any match to oppose me having an equal strength.

6. O bull-bannered lord, what can I do with these thousand mountain-like hands without a fight.

7. When my hands itch for war I desire to fight the elephants of the quarters. By hitting the cities and mountains I reduced them to powder. Being frightened they fled away.

8. Yama has been made a combatant with me and the great fire-god too, similarly. Varuna has been made a cowherd looking after my cows.

Sanatkumara said:

12. Becoming furious on hearing that, Siva laughed boisterously and in a wonderful manner; Siva the remover of the distress of devotees became very angry and said.

Siva said—

13. Fie upon you, O haughty base Daitya, such a talk as this does not behove the son of Bali and a devotee.

14. Very soon, you will meet a terrible challenge to your bluff by fighting a great battle against a person equal to me in strength. The battle will be sudden.

15. Therein your mountain-like hands will be cut off by weapons and missiles. They will fall off like reeds or stumps of plantain trees.

16-18. “O wicked soul, when this flagstaff of yours, with the emblem of a peacock with a human head, which is installed in your armoury, falls without being blown off by a gust of wind, you can decide within your mind that a terrible battle is at hand. Go to that terrible war accompanied by all your generals. Now return to your abode where Siva is present.

19. O wicked one, you will see the great evil portents.” After saying this, the lord who is favourably disposed to the devotees and is the dispeller of pride stopped.

Sanatkumara said:

20. After hearing that, Bana worshiped Siva with palms joined in reverence in the form of buds and bowed to lord Siva. He then went to his abode.

21. On being asked, the delighted Asura mentioned everything to Kumbhan(Ja in the manner it had happened. The Asura Bana awaited the particular conjunction of circumstances eagerly.

25-26. He thought within himself "Who can be that warrior fond of battle, a master of the art of using weapons and missiles who will cut off my thousand hands like reeds or whom I shall cut into hundred pieces?”

27-28. In the meantime, in the month of Vaisakha after her monthly course, the daughter of Bana had her auspicious bath and auspicious rites after worshipping lord Siva. At night she lay asleep in the well-guarded harem. It was then that Kama entered the place with lord Siva.

29-30. She was seized by Krsna’s grandson*14 sent by Parvati of divine Maya. She began to cry helplessly. He enjoyed her forcibly. Within a moment he was carried to Dvaraka** 6 by Parvati’s attendants by means of their divine Yogic power.

31. Rubbed and squeezed thus, she got up crying. She mumbled various words to her female attendants. She even decided to give up her life.

In what family is he born who has fascinated my mind thus?” On hearing the words of Oja, the friend told her then.

# 36.

Citralekha said: “O gentle lady, how shall I bring that man who was seen by you in the dream and whom I do not know?”

# 37.

Thus said by her, the daughter of the Daitya blinded by passion was ready to end her life. She was saved thus by her friend on the first day.

# 38.

O excellent sage, again that daughter of Kumbhanda, Citralekha, of great intellect spoke to Oja the daughter of Bana.

# 39.

I can dispel your grief if such a man could be anywhere in the three worlds. I shall bring him who has captivated your mind. Please mention the details of his features.

After saying this, she painted all the gods on a canvas together with the Daityas, Danavas, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Nagas, Yakshas and others.

Similarly she painted men, the Vj-jnis among them, the heroic Anakadundubhi, Balarama, Krishna and Pradyumna the excellent among men.

On seeing Aniruddha the son of Pradyumna painted, she became bashful. Oja’s heart was filled with delight. She stood with downcast face.

In whose family is he born? What is his name? On being thus asked by her, the lady, expert in yogic practice, mentioned the name of the family.

Ufd said—

47-48, O my friend, ascertain some means lovingly so that I shall regain my beloved husband in a trice. Without him, my friend, I am not at all eager to live even for a moment. Please bring him here strenuously. O my friend, make me happy.

Sanatkumara said:

O 49. On being thus requested by the daughter of Bana, excellent sage, the daughter of the minister was surprised and began to think seriously.

50. Then taking leave of her friend, and knowing him to be the grandson of Kr$na, Citralekha got ready to go to Dvaraka with the velocity of the mind.

51-53. When the third day after the fourteenth day in the dark half of the month of Jyestha elapsed, a Muhurta before the dawn, she reached the city of Dvaraka within a moment by the aerial path because she was a Yogini. Then in the park of the harem the son of Pradyumna was seen by her playing with women and drinking wine. He was dark-complexioned but beautiful in every limb, smiling and in the prime of youth.

54-55. When he lay on the cot she encompassed him with the shroud of darkness by employing her Tamasa Yoga. Thereafter she carried the cot on her head and within a moment reached the city of Sonita where the daughter of Bana eagerly awaited her.

56. Passionate that she was, she made various mad pranks displaying her emotions. On seeing that he was actually brought she became frightened too.

57. When they began their sexual dalliance in that fresh contact in the well-guarded harem, it became known to all in a moment.

58-59. The man with a divine body who carried on illegitimate affairs with a virgin was found out by the persons appointed at the doorway to the harem with cane-sticks in their old and emaciated hands, by means of gestures and inferences. They understood that he was a young man, very comely in ftatuics, dating and fend of battle.

60. On seeing him, the heroic men who guarded the harem went and told Bana, son of Bali, everything. The gatekeepers said:

61. O lord, no one knows how this was done. Indra has entered your harem in secret and forcibly. He has outraged the modesty of your daughter by seizing her himself. O lord of Danavas, of great arms, see him here. Do

Sanatkumdra said:

63. O excellent sage, on hearing their words, on hearing of the defilement of his daughter, the lord of Danavas of great strength, became surprised.

# CHAPTER FIFTYTHREE

# (The dalliance of Ufa and Aniruddha)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. The infuriated Asura Bana went there and saw Aniruddha who was in the fresh years of youth and who seemed to have been born especially for divine sports.

2. The infuriated Bana, very efficient in war, was a bit surprised on seeing him and wondered why he had done like that and therefore said mockingly.

3. “Oh this man is really handsome, bold and daring. Can this unfortunate deluded person be? His death is imminent. O angry ones, with weapons immediately

4. kill the fellow who has outraged the traditional purity of my family and "defiled my dear daughter.

5. O heroic ones, bind the terrible fellow of evil conduct. Put him in a frightful prison for a long time.”

6. After saying this, the Asura Bana thought within himself intelligently. “It is not known who this fearless fellow is. Certainly he is a man of terrible exploit”. Thinking thus Bana hesitated to act.

7. Then gradually the evil-minded Daitya ordered ten thousand men from his army for slaying him.

8. Commanded by him those heroic terrible fellows encircled the harem saying, “Cut him, pierce him.”

9-10. On seeing the army of the enemy, Aniruddha the scion of the Yadava family, roared. He seized the big iron club from the harem-gate and came out of the apartment like the god of death armed with thunderbolt. With that iron club he killed the servants and returned to the harem. O excellent thus Aniruddha strengthened by sage, Siva’s splendour, with eyes turned red by anger, killed all the ten thousand men of the army.

11. With the sword captured in the course of the battle he killed ten thousands of horses and charioteers of the lord of Daityas. When a hundred thousand soldiers had been killed, the Asura Bana furiously entered the fray taking with him Kumbhanja, expert in war. He then challenged Aniruddha for a duel in the course of that war Aniruddha the highly intelligent son of Pradyumna, of refulgent body and protected by Siva’s brilliance.

12-14. Aniruddha then seized a spear blazing like the fire of death, for killing him and hit him with that.

15. Bana was hit with the spear even as he was seated in a chariot. In a trice the heroic demon vanished along with his horse.

16. When he vanished, Aniruddha, the unvanquished son of Pradyumna, stood steady like a mountain observing all the quarters.

17. Remaining invisible, that Danava Bana, practising deceptive fight, hit him again and again with thousands of weapons.

18. That powerful son of Bali, the heroic devotee of Siva, the Asura Bana deceitfully bound him with Serpent-nooses.

19. After binding him and putting him in a cage he

stopped the battle. The infuriated Bapa then spoke to the very powerful son of the charioteer.

The Asura Bdna said:

1. O son of the charioteer, cut off the head of this wicked fellow who has defiled my family.
2. After chopping off the limbs, give them to the Rak$asas. Or let the beasts of prey swallow his flesh and blood.
3. Or kill this sinner and put him in a grassy well. O son of the charioteer, what more shall I say? By all means he must be slain.

Sanatkumdra said:

On hearing his words, the Asura Kumbha^d** the most excellent of the ministers and righteous in thought, spoke to Bana.

Kumbhanda said:

O lord, this is not a proper thing to do. Please consider. I think by killing him we will be killing ourselves.
O lord, he seems to be equal to Vijnu in exploits. His strength has been increased by the brilliance of the moon-crested lord, your favourite.
Moreover, in daring he is equal to the moon-crested lord; though he is reduced to this plight he maintains his manliness.
It is by the grace of Siva that he, the grandson of KffQa, considers us insignificant as the blades of grass. Although he is bitten by serpents cruelly he is still very strong.

Sematkum&#x26;ra said:

After saying thus to Ba$a, the Danava, the most excellent among statesmen, spoke to Aniruddha.

31. Repeat piteously “I am vanquished*. Eulogise the heroic lord of the Daityas. Join your palms in reverence and bow to him.

32. If you do like this, you may get release. Otherwise this captivity and tortures will continue. On hearing this Aniruddha replied.

# Aniruddha said:

33. O friend of the basest of Daityas, O you that sustain yourself with the balls of rice offered in the hands, O demon of evil conduct, you do not know the laws of adversaries.

34. I think that for the valorous person humble supplications and running away from the battlefield are worse than death. These are adverse and painful to him like a dart.

35. For a Kshatriya, death while fighting face to face with the enemy is commendable rather than joining the palms in reverence like a man in humble condition professing to be valorous.

# Sanatkumara said:

36. These and many other heroic words he uttered, on hearing which Bana was surprised and angry too.

37. Then a celestial voice was heard for the pacification of Bana which Aniruddha and all the heroes, the minister, stood listening to.

# The celestial voice said:

38. “O Bana, O great hero, you shall not be angry. O devotee of Siva, O intelligent one, you are the son of Bali. Ponder over this.

42. Even a weak person becomes strong, thanks to his will, O excellent son of Bali. O intelligent one, realise this in your mind, be normal and complacent.

43. The lord who quells pride, who is an expert in various sports and who is favourably disposed to his devotees will destroy your arrogance.*

Sanatkumdra said:

44. O great sage, having spoken thus, the celestial voice stopped. On hearing these words the Asura Bana did not kill Aniruddha.

45. Then he went to his harem and drank excellent beverages. His intellect was adversely affected, he forgot those words and began to sport.

46. Aniruddha was bound by serpentine bodies emitting poison powerfully. His passion for his beloved had not been satiated fully. He remembered Durga then.

Aniruddha said:

47. O goddess, you are worthy of being resorted to. I have been bound by serpents. O goddess bestowing fame, O goddess of fierce fury, come and save me.

48. O great goddess, devotee of Siva, O cause of creation, sustenance and dissolution, there is no other saviour except you. O Siva, save me.

Sanatkumdra said:

49. Propitiated by him, Kali, lustrous like the split collyrium, arrived there in the dark night of the fourteenth day in the dark half of the month Jye$tha.

50-51. With the heavy blows of her fists she broke the cage. She reduced the serpentine arrows to ashes. She released Aniruddha and let him enter the harem and then vanished from the scene.

Sanatkumdra said:

2. O excellent sage, on hearing the woeful cries of his women when Aniruddha had gone off suddenly, Krsna too became vexed.

3. The four months of the rainy season thus went by when his relatives and Visnu could not see Aniruddha and so they bewailed.

4. On hearing from Narada about the imprisonment and activities of Aniruddha the Vf?nis, followers of Krsna, became dejected.

5. On hearing everything, Kf$na immediately called Garuqla and went to the city of Sonita eagerly for fighting.

21. On seeing his army being scattered, Siva became highly infuriated and roared terribly.

22. On hearing that, Siva's Ganas too shouted and fought. They suppressed the opponents with their strength increased by Siva’s brilliance.

23. Krsna discharged separate types of missiles from his bow towards the trident-bearing lord Siva who without showing any dismay quelled them directly.

24. They discharged Brahma-missile in counter to Brahma missile; the mountain-missile to the wind-missile; the cloud-missile to the fire-missile and Siva-missile to the Narayana missile.

25. Defeated by the opponents, the army of Krsna fled, O Vyasa; it could not face the full refulgence of Siva.

26. O sage, when his army was routed, lord Krsna, the scorcher of enemies, discharged terrible fever missile named ‘cold’.1

27. O sage, when the army of Krsna was routed, the cold fever missile of Krsna rushed at Rudra blazing the ten quarters.

28. On seeing that coming, lord Siva discharged his own fever missile. The two fever missiles fought each other.

29. Oppressed by the fever missile of lord Siva, the fever missile of Siva cried aloud. Unable to secure succour elsewhere, it eulogised the bull-bannered lord.

30. The delighted lord Siva, favourably disposed to those who seek refuge, eulogised by Krsna’s fever missile, spoke to the cold fever missile of Krsna.

328. The mention of the missile of cold fever and of the counter missile to ward it off indicates the heights that India had attained in military science.

Lord Siva said:

31. “O cold fever, I am delighted. Leave off your fear from my fever. There is no fear from fever to him who remembers this anecdote.

Sanatkumdra said:

32. Thus advised, the fever missile of Visnu went away after bowing to Siva. On seeing that activity, Krsna was surprised and dismayed.

33. When attacked by the arrows of Pradyumna, the infuriated Karttikeya, the slayer of Daityas, hit Pradyumna with his spear.

34. When hit by Karttikeya’s spear, Pradyumna, though very strong, shed blood from his limbs and fled from the battle ground.

35. Hit with various missiles by Kumbhantja and Kupakarna, Balabhadra though strong did not stay there. He fled from the battle-field.

37. Then the infuriated bull, the powerful vehicle of lord Siva, hit him with great force by means of his horns.

38. When his limbs were shattered by the blows of his horns, Garuda was dismayed. He forsook Visnu and fled from the battle ground immediately.

39. When the situation was like this, lord Krsna, dismayed by Siva’s refulgence spoke to the charioteer suddenly.

Lord Krsna said:

Lord Krsna said:

49. You are the primordial Purusa without a second. You are the fourth being, the vision of the soul. You appear as undergoing change though you are the lord, the cause without another cause unto you.

O Vyasa of great intellect, listen to the highly wonderful story of Krsna and Siva who indulge in sports in accordance with the worldly conventions.
When Siva sportively lay flat on the ground along with his sons and Ganas, Bana the king of Daityas came out to fight with Krsna.
With the horses mobilised by Kumbharuja, and bolding various weapons and missiles, the powerful son of Bali performed an incomparable fight.
On seeing his army destroyed, the lord of the Daityas became infuriated. The powerful son of Bali fought an incomparable battle.

2. The intervening space between heaven and Earth was filled with the great sound originating from the twang on his bow.

3. Drawing the string of his bow upto the ear, the infuriated Vi?nu discharged sharp arrows, as furious as serpents, on Bana.

4. On seeing the arrows coming, Dana the son of Bali, split them even before they reached him, by means of arrows discharged from his bow.

5. Ldrd Bana, suppressor of enemies roared again. The Vrsnis thinking of Kr$na were afraid and dejected.

6. Thinking upon the lotus-like feet of Siva, the haughty son of Bali discharged his arrows at Krsna the most valorous.

7. Thinking upon the lotus-like feet of Siva, the powerful destroyer of Asuras, Krsna split them before they reached him by means of his own arrows.

8. Rama and other Vrsnis, the powerful ones agitated by anger, slew their respective opponents.

9. Thus the tumultuous fight between the two strong armies went on for a long time aggravating the wonder of the spectators.

10. In the meantime the infuriated king of birds suppressed the army of Bana striking all with his wings.

11. Seeing his army routed and himself oppressed, Bana, the powerful lord of Daityas, son of Bali, foremost among Siva's devotees, was infuriated.

24. Thinking upon Siva he hit Bana and his terrible army simultaneously with the good arrows discharged with force from his bow.

25. Visnu split his bow and umbrella as well as other things. Without being excited he killed and felled his horses by means of his arrows.

26. Bana the great hero roared furiously. He hit Krsna with his iron club and Krsna fell on the ground.

27. O celestial sage, Krsna got up immediately and fought with Bana, the great devotee of Siva. It was to keep up the worldly sport that he fought thus.

28. A great battle went on for a long time between Krsna who was Visnu or Siva himself and that strong Asura who was the most excellent devotee of Siva.

29. O great sage, the powerful Krsna fought for a long time with Bana. Deriving strength at the instance of Siva he became furious.

30. At the bidding of Siva, lord Krsna, the destroyer of heroic enemies, chopped off several arms of Bana by means of SudarSana.

31. Only his four beautiful arms were left. Thanks to the grace of Siva, the demon too was freed from pain.

32. Forgetting himself, Krsna who assumed a great prowess, attempted to cut off the head of Bana. Then Siva got up.

Siva said:

33. O lord, son of DevakT, O Visnu, what was ordained by me formerly has been accomplished by you who always follow my dictates.

34. Do not cut off the head of Bana. Withdraw your weapon Sudarsana. At my bidding the discus shall always be rendered ineffective with regard to my people.

39. O Visnu, sometime back he became haughty enough to say “Give me battle” while he scratched his arms and forgot his goal.

40. Then I cursed him “Ere long, the person will arrive and cut off your arms. You shall be cured of your haughtiness”.

41. (Turning to Bana) At my bidding Visnu has cut off your arms. Now withdraw from the battlefield. Go back to your abode along with the married couple.

Sanatkumdra said:

42. Saying this and uniting them in friendship, lord Siva returned to his abode along with his sons and Ganas.

43. On hearing the words of Siva, Krsna withdrew Sudar£ana. With his body unwounded, the victorious Krsna entered into the harem.

44. He consoled Aniruddha and his wife. He accepted the jewels given in plenty by Bana.

45. They took Osa’s friend Citralekha the great Yogini also with them. Krsna who accomplished his task at the bidding of Siva was immensely pleased.

jVdrada said :

1. O great sage, when Kf?na left for Dvaraka along with Aniruddha and his wife, what did Bana do? Please narrate the same to me.

Sanatkumdra said :

2. When Kf§na left for Dvaraka with Aniruddha and his wife, Bana was distressed thinking on his previous ignorance.

3. Then Nandin, a gana of Siva, spoke to the grief-stricken Daitya Bana whose limbs were smeared with blood and who repented repeatedly.

NandiSvara said :

4. O Bana, devotee of Siva, do not repent, Siva is compassionate towards his devotees. Hence he is called Bhaktavatsala (i.e. favourably disposed to the devotees).

5. O foremost among devotees, whatever has happened, has happened at his will. Consider this and remember Siva again and again.

6. Fixing your mind in the primordial being, Siva who is compassionate towards the devotees, you celebrate his festival again and again.

7. At the suggestion of Nandin, Bana who had been like Rahu unto his enemies immediately went to Siva’s temple with lofty mind and great courage.

8. After going there he bowed to the lord and lamented in great agitation. Bana who had been divested of his haughtiness became overwhelmed with love and devotion.

9-10. He eulogised him with various hymns. He bowed to the lord in the course of his worship. With proper steps and gestures of hands he performed the Tantjava dance assuming various poses and postures — Pratyalidha, Sthanaka, Alitjha32 being the chief among them.

32. Alisha is a kind of pose in dance, with the right foot advanced and the left retracted. The opposite of this is the pose of Pratyill^ha in which the left foot is advanced and the right is drawn back. Sth&#x26;naka is a particular attitude of the body in dance.

11-14. He produced thousands of gestures through his mouth. He knit and bent his brows and shook his head in various ways. He kept thousands of attendants in rows. He showed various gestures gradually. Much of his blood was shed on the ground. By all these means he propitiated the trident-bearing moon-crested lord. Banasura the great devotee of Siva forgot himself and his activities in the course of his worship. Siva who is fond of dance and music and is favourably disposed to his devotees spoke to Bana.

Siva said:

15. O “Dear Bana, son of Bali, I am delighted by your dance. Lord of Daityas, you choose the boon whatever be in your mind."

Sanatkumdra said:

16-20. O sage, on hearing the words of Siva, Bana the lord of Daityas asked for the healing of wounds, the skill in duels, everlasting position of Ganahood, the kingship for U?a*s son at the city of Sonita, absence of enmity with the gods and Vi?nu in particular, absence of rebirth as a Daitya defiled by the attributes Rajas and Tamas, special devotion to Siva without any aberration for ever, friendship with the devotees of Siva and kindness to all living beings. After requesting for these boons, the son of Bali, the great Asura joined his palms in reverence and eulogised Siva with tears of love in his eyes.

Bfya said:

21. O great lord, lord of the gods, favourably disposed to those who seek refuge in you, O great lord, I bow to you, O kinsman of the distressed, O storehouse of mercy. O ocean of sympathy, you have taken pity on me.

22. O Siva, being delighted with my arrogance, you have removed me.

23. You are Brahman, the great soul, the all-pervading lord. Your body is the whole cosmos. You are Ugra, Iia, .Virif, the great, accompanied by everything.

24. O lord, your navel is the sky, mouth is the fire, semen is the water, ear the quarters, head the heaven, foot the earth and mind the moon.

25. Your eye is the sun, the stomach the ocean, the arm Indra, and the intellect Brahma. Your excretion is Prajapati and your heart is Dharma.

26. O lord, your hairs are the herbs and plants, your tresses the clouds, your eyes the three attributes. You are the Purusa, the soul of all.

27. They call Brahmana your mouth, Ksatriya your arms, Vai$ya your thighs and Sudra your feet.

28. O lord Siva, you alone deserve to be adored by all living beings. A person worshipping you certainly derives liberation. O the man who you, favou-

29. lord, forsakes the rite Atman, for the adverse objects of sense, swallows poison forsaking nectar.

30. Visnu, Brahma, the gods and the sages of pure mind, in every respect resort to you, the favourite lord.

Sanatkumdra said:

31. After saying this, the Asura Bana, son of Bali stopped with all the limbs blooming with love and bowed to lord Siva.

32. On hearing the request of his devotee Bana, lord Siva said “You will get everything” and vanished there itself.

33. Then through the grace of Siva, Bana attained the immortality of the eternal time and becoming one of the attendants of Siva he rejoiced much.

34. Thus I have narrated by means of words pleasing to the ears, the excellent story of the trident-bearing lord Siva, who is the preceptor of the preceptors and who sports about always in the middle of the worlds. His story includes his activities in relation to Bana.

33$. It refer* to the fourfold clarification of ancient Indian society as mentioned in the Purufaaukta of the Rgveda.

# CHAPTER FIFTYSEVEN

# (Gajasura is slain)

Sanatkumdra said :

1. O Vyasa, listen with great devotion to the story of moon-crested lord, how he killed Gajasura, the lord of Danavas, by means of his trident.
2. Formerly when the Asura Mahisa was killed in battle by the goddess for the welfare of the gods, they became very happy.
3. O great sage, his son the great hero Gajasura could not forget the slaying of his father by the goddess at the request of the gods and hence remembered that enmity. He therefore went to the forest for undertaking penance. Interestingly he performed penance meditating on Brahma.
4. “I shall not be killed by men or women overwhelmed by lust.” Thinking thus in his mind he directed his attention to austerities.
5. He performed a severe penance in a valley on the Himalaya mountain. He kept his arms lifted. He fixed his eyes at the sky. He stood on the ground on the two big toes.
6. With plenty of matted tresses of hair the benevolent Gajasura, the son of Mahisa shone with his refulgence like the sun at the time of dissolution.
7. The fire in the form of penance originating from his head filled with smoke spread all round to the worlds above, below and on the sides scorching them.
8. The rivers and the seas were agitated by the fire originating from his head. The stars fell along with the planets. The ten quarters blazed.
9. The gods scorched by the fire left heaven and went to Brahma’s world along with Indra and submitted to him. The earth quaked.
10. The gods said :
11. O Brahma, we are agitated on being scorched by the fire.

334. The Asura Mahisa, father of Gaja, was slain in battle by Cai>4>ki. He should be distinguished from the Asura Mahifa who was killed by k&#x26;rttikrya.

the penance of Gajasura. We are unable to stay in heaven. Hence we seek refuge in you.

12. Make it subside and find out a merciful remedy to enliven others. Otherwise the worlds will perish. Truth. It is the truth that we speak.

13. Thus informed by the gods including Indra and others the selfborn deity Brahma went to the hermitage of the excellent Daitya along with Bhygu,*** Daksa*** and others.

14. On seeing him scorching the heaven and the worlds by his penance, the surprised creator laughed and said. Brahma said:

15. “O lord of Daityas, stand up, stand up. O son of Mahija, you have achieved perfection in penance. O dear one, I, the granter of boons, have come. Choose your boon as you wish.”

Sanatkumara said:

16. Getting up in a hurry, the son of Mahija, the lord of Daityas glanced at the lord and praised him lovingly with choking words.

Gajasura said:

17-18. O lord, O lord of the gods, if you are going to grant me a boon let me be immune from death by men or women overwhelmed by lust. Let me be very powerful, valorous and invincible to the gods, the guardians of the worlds**⁷ and others for ever. Let me enjoy all prosperities.

19. Thus requested by the Danava, Brahma338 who was delighted by his penance granted him the rare boon.

20. Securing the boons thus, the Daitya Gajasura the son of Mahisa, returned to his abode with a happy mind.

21-22. The great Asura conquered all the quarters, the three worlds, the gods, Asuras, human beings, kings, Gandharvas, Garuda, serpents and others. He made them subservient to him. He became the conqueror of the universe. He usurped the places of the guardians of the worlds and took away their glory.

23. He occupied heaven138 possessing the glory of the celestial garden and the palace of lord Indra built by Vishvakarman.340

24. The powerful Daitya of a lofty mind who reigned as the sole ruler after conquering all the worlds sported in the palace of lord Indra. The gods and others who were overwhelmed by his power worshipped the pair of his feet. He exercised a stern and fierce authority.

25. Thus conquering the quarters and reigning as the supreme overlord he enjoyed pleasures to the maximum extent. Since he had not conquered his senses he was never satiated in his enjoyment of pleasures.

26. He was haughty, puffed up with prosperity. He slighted and transgressed the injunctions of the sacred scriptures. After the lapse of some time he became evil-minded.

27. The Danava, the suppressor of the gods, the son of Mahishasura harassed the excellent brahmins and the sages on the earth very much.

28. The wicked Daitya harassed the gods, the human beings, and all the Pramathas. He tortured all righteous people particularly recollecting the previous enmity.

29. O dear, once this Danava of great strength,

338. Brahma assumed the name Satadhrti after completing a hundred sacrifices. This name he shares with Indra, the performer of a hundred horse-sacrifices.

339. See Note 298 P. 992.

340. Vishvakarman was the founder of the science of architecture and mechanics among the gods. He is credited with the construction of the royal palace for lord Indra.

Gajasura came to the capital city of Siva.

30. O sage, when the lord of Asuras came there, there was a great tumult among the residents of Anandavana. They shouted “Protect, Protect.”

31-32. When this son of Mahisasura, haughty of his valour, entered the city suppressing the Pramathas, Indra and other gods previously vanquished by him sought refuge in Siva. After bowing to him they eulogised him with great respect.

33. They mentioned to him the arrival of the Danava at Ka$i, the height of distress of the people there, especially of the rulers. The gods said:

34. O great gods, O lord of gods, the Asura has gone to your city. He is inflicting pain on your people. O storehouse of benignity, please slay him.

35. Wherever he sets foot on the earth he shakes the ground there by his great weight.

36. By his great velocity trees fall down with roots and branches. Hit by his brawny arms, big mountains are reduced to powder.

37. The clouds leave the sky hit by his head. Still they do not lose their blueness due to the contact with his hair.

38. When he breathes out, the mighty oceans surge up with their billows. Even the rivers are filled with waves as though with whales.

39. His height is nine thousand Yojanas. The girth of this Asura who wields Maya is also of that proportion.

40. The tawny colour and the tremulousness of his eyes is not borne even by the lightning. Thus he has come there all of a sudden.

41. Whichever quarter he approaches, the Danava is unbearably oppressive. “I am not to be killed by men or women overwhelmed by lust” he shouts.

42. O lord of the gods, we have thus mentioned humbly the activities of that Danava. Please protect your devotees, O lord, desirous of protecting Ka$i.

Sanatkumara said :

# 43.

Thus requested by the gods, Siva desirous of protecting the devotees came there quickly with the desire of slaying him.

# 44.

On seeing that Siva, favourably disposed to his devotees, had come roaring with the trident in his hand, Gajasura too roared.

# 45.

A wonderfully terrible and great battle was fought between them roaring heroically and hitting with various weapons and missiles.

# 46.

The brilliant Gajasura of great strength and valour pierced Siva, the slayer of the DInavas, with sharp arrows. O Siva who assumed a terrible sage, split with his terrible arrows, the arrows of the Daitya to small pieces like gingelly seeds, even before they reached him.

# 47.

Then the infuriated Gajasura rushed at the lord Siva roaring loudly with a sword in hand “You are slain now by me.”

# 48.

Then the lord armed with the trident, realising that the leading Daitya who was rushing at him could not be killed by anything else or any one else, hit him with his trident.

# 49.

When the trident pierced through his body, the Daitya Gajasura thought that he was raised up like an umbrella. He then sang the glory of Siva.

# 50.

Gajasura said :

# 51.

O great lord, lord of the gods, I am in every respect your devotee. O trident-bearing lord, I know you as the lord of heaven and destroyer of Kama.

# 52.

O enemy of Andhaka, O great lord, O slayer of Tripuras, omnipresent, my death at your hands is conducive to my great glory.

# 53.

I desire to submit something. O merciful lord, please listen to it. conqueror of death, I am speaking the truth, not a lie. Please ponder.

should consider a death like this conducive to glory in due course.

Sanatkumdra said:

55. On hearing his words, lord Siva, the storehouse of mercy, laughed and replied to Gajasura, the son of Mahisa.

Lord Siva said:

56. O Gajasura, O excellent Danava, O depository of great valour, O well-intentioned one, I am delighted. Choose the boon favourable to you.

Sanatkumdra said:

57. On hearing the words of lord Siva, the granter of boons, the lord of Danavas, the delighted Gajasura replied.

Gajasura said:

58. O nude one, if you are delighted, O lord Siva, wear this hide of mine sanctified by the fire of your trident.

59. It is of your size, it is gentle to the touch, it has been kept as a stake in the battlefield, it is worth seeing, it is of divine nature and it is always pleasing.

60. Let it ever emit an agreeable smell, let it be soft forever, let it be ever free from dirt, let it be your best ornament always.

61. O lord, even after being scorched by the flames of the fire of penance for a long time, this hide was not burnt, hence it is the storehouse of holy fragrance.

62. O nude one, if my hide is not meritorious how did it get into contact with your limbs in the battlefield?

63. O Siva, if you are satisfied, please grant me another boon. Beginning from today let your name be Kfttivasas (one clad in elephant-hide).

Sanatkumdra said:

64. On hearing his words, Siva who is favourably disposed to his devotees, was pleased and replied to Gajasura, the son of Mahisa “Let It be so”.

65. Lord Siva, the favourite of his devotees, becoming delighted spoke again to the Danava Gajasura whose mind had been purified by devotion.

Loyd Siva said:

66. “In this holy place, a means to the achievement of liberation, let your meritorious body become phallic image yielding liberation to all.

67. It will be the foremost of all phallic images yielding salvation, destroying great sins and named “Krttivase-Svara”.

Sanatkum&#x26;ra said:

68. After saying this Siva, the lord of the gods, accepted the hide of Gajasura and wore it.

69. O great sage, there was a great jubilation on that day. All the people staying at Kasi and the Pramathas were delighted.

70. Visnu, Brahma and other gods were delighted in their minds. With palms joined in reverence they bowed to lord Siva and eulogised him.

71. When Gajasura the lord of the Danavas, and the son of Mahi$a was killed, the gods returned to their original place and the universe attained normalcy.

72. Thus I have narrated to you the story of Siva which shows his affection to his devotees, which is conducive to the attainment of heaven, fame and longevity and which increases wealth and food-grains.

73. He who listens to this with devotion, or narrates this observing pure rites, enjoys great happiness and attains salvation, the greatest bliss hereafter.

# CHAPTER FIFTYEIGHT

# ( Dundubhi Nirhrdda is slain)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. O Vyasa, listen. I shall narrate the story of the moon-crested lord Siva how he slew the Daitya Dundubhi-nirhrada.

2. When the Daitya Hiranyaksa, son of Did, of great strength was killed by Visnu, Diti remained grief-stricken for a long time.

3. The wicked Daitya named Dundubhinirhrada, the uncle of Prahlada, the oppressor of the gods, consoled the dejected mother with the words.

4. After consoling Diti, the king of Daityas, an expert in using Maya began to think of the ways and means of conquering the gods easily.

5. “The great Asura Hiranyaksa along with his brother has been killed through Visnu by the gods, the enemies of Daityas, employing deceitful means.

6. What is the strength of the gods? What is their diet? What is their support? How can the gods be easily vanquished by me?” Thinking like this he tried to find out the ways and means.

7. Thinking deeply in diverse ways the Daitya came to the conclusion that the brahmanas were the cause of the trouble.

8. The Daitya Dundubhinirhrada, the most wicked enemy of the gods, ran after the brahmins to kill them.

9. Since the gods maintain themselves on sacrifices, sacrifices are born of the Vedas and the Vedas are the custody of the brahmanas, so the brahmanas constitute the strength of the gods.

Diti was the daughter of Dak?a and wife of Kasyapa. Her sons obtained the designation 'Daitya' after her name.

The anti-Brihmana activities of the Daityas mentioned here and elsewhere in the Purigas were due to the fact that the Brihmapas performed sacrifices wherein offerings were made to the gods. But this tradition of Brihmapa—Daitya animosity is of late origin. Originally Daityas were devoted to Brahmanas. The BhSrgava were purohitas to Hiranyakaiipu. Vasi^ha was his hot. Vjtra and Namuci, the two famous Dftnavas were Brihmapas themselves. For details see AIHT. Ch XXVI.

10. Certainly the gods including Indra are supported by the br&#x26;hmanas. The gods gain their strength from the brahmanas. There is no doubt about this.

11. If the brahmanas are destroyed the Vedas will perish. If they are destroyed the gods will also perish.

12-13. If the sacrifices are destroyed, the gods will lose their food. They will grow weaker and be easily conquered. When the gods are conquered I shall become the sole honorable lord of the three worlds. I shall then confiscate the everlasting riches of the gods.

14. I shall enjoy happiness in my kingdom freed of thorns.” After thinking like this the wicked Daitya thought again.

15. “Where are these brahmanas in plenty—the brahmanas strengthened by the splendour of the Brahman, well versed in the study of the Vedas and possessing the strength of penance?

16. It is Varanasi indeed that is the place of many brahmanas. I shall finish that first and then go to other holy centres.

17. In holy centres or hermitages wherever these brahmanas live they shall be devoured by me.”

18. After thinking thus in accordance with the nature of his race, Dundubhinirhrada went to Kail and he, the wicked wielder of Mayas, killed the brahmanas.

19. When the excellent brahmanas went to the forest to fetch sacrificial twigs and the Darbha grass, the wicked Danava used to eat them there.

20. After that he used to lie hidden so that nobody could detect him. In the forest he used to roam about like a forest-dweller and in the waters he used to take the form of an aquatic animal.

21-22. He was invisible in form. He wielded the art of deception. He could not be seen even by the gods. During the day he stood in the midst of sages engaged in meditation but observing the ingress and egress of persons in the hut. But at night he took the form of a tiger and ate many of them.

23. He used to eat unhesitatingly never leaving even

Rudrasarfifdtd a bone behind. Thus many brahmanas were annihilated by him in this way.

24. Once on the Sivaratri day a certain devotee performed the worship of Siva, the lord of the gods and was engaged in meditation in his own hut.

25. The lord of Daityas Dundubhinirhiada, proud of his strength, assumed the form of a tiger and wanted to seize him.

26. As the devotee was in meditation with a mind concentrated on Siva and as he had fixed the Astramantra, the Daitya could not attack him.

27. Siva, the omnipresent lord, knew his evil intention and decided to slay the Daitya.

28. While the Daitya in the form of the tiger was about to snatch the devotee, Siva appeared before him. The three-eyed lord Siva is very keen in intellect in saving the devotees, nay in protecting the universe.

29. On seeing Siva coming out of the phallic image worshipped by the devotee, the Daitya in the form of a tiger increased in size like a big mountain.

30. The Danava glanced with a contemptuous look at Siva but the lord caught him and pressed him under his armpit.

31. The five-faced lord favourably disposed to his devotees hit the tiger on its head with his fist harder than thunderbolt.

32. By the blow of the fist and the pressure at the armpit the tiger groaned aloud in great distress filling heaven and earth with the sound and died.

33. Agitated in their minds by the loud sound the ascetics came there in the night itself following the track of the sound.

34. On seeing the lord there with the lord of the beasts in his armpit they bowed to him. They eulogised him with the words of “Victory, Victory.”

343. SivarStri or Siva-caturdaii is the fourteenth of the dark half of Magha (January-February) on which a rigorous fast is observed during the day and night.

The brahmins said:

35. We are saved, O, we are saved from this terrible obstacle. O lord, please bless us. O preceptor of the universe stay here alone.

36. O great lord, in this self-same form in the name of the lord of the tiger offer protection. Let this place remain sacred always.

37. Save us the dwellers in this holy centre from other mishaps too. O lord of Parvati, leaving the wicked ones offer fearlessness to your devotees.

Sanatkumdra said:

38. On hearing the words of the devotees, the moon-crested lord who is favourably disposed to the devotees said affirmatively and told the devotees again.

Lord Siva said:

39. “If any one sees me here in this form with faith, I will undoubtedly remove his torments and mishaps.

40. After hearing this story of mine and after remembering my phallic image in the heart if a man enters the battlefield he will certainly win.

41. In the meantime the gods came there along with Indra shouting slogans of victory jubilantly.”

42. After bowing to Siva with love, the gods joined their palms in reverence, drooped their shoulders and eulogised lord Siva who is favourably disposed to his devotees.

The gods said:

43. O lord Siva, lord of the gods, remover of the distress of your devotees, be victorious. We the gods have been saved by killing this demon.

44. O fond of devotees, you shall protect them always. O lord of the gods, wicked men shall be slain by you, O lord of all.

47-48. He who reads this sacred narrative about the origin of the lord of the tiger, hears, narrates or teaches this shall obtain all desires. After-death he will attain salvation becoming free of all miseries.

49. This narrative is incomparable as it contains the nectar-like words of the divine sports of Siva. It is conducive to the attainment of heaven, fame and longevity. It increases sons and grandsons.

50. It yields great devotion and bliss. It is auspicious and increases the pleasure of Siva. It yields supreme knowledge. It is beautiful and removes all aberrations.

# (Vidala and Utpala are slain)

Sanatkumdra said:

1. O Vyasa, listen with pleasure to the story of the great lord how he killed through his beloved a Daitya whom he indicated by a sign. —Vidala

2. Formerly there were two great Daityas and Utpala. They were great heroes, puffed up by the boon from Brahma that they could not be slain by a man.

3. O Brahmin, the gods had been defeated in the battle by the two Daityas who by the strength of their arms considered the people of the three worlds as insignificant as the blade of grass.

4. Defeated by them, the gods sought refuge in Brahma. After bowing to him duly they submitted to him respectfully.

5-6. On hearing their account Brahma said. “They will surely be slain by the goddess. Be bold. Remember Siva and Parvati respectfully. Siva is auspicious, benevolent favourably disposed to his devotees. The supreme god will bring about welfare eft long.”

Sanatkumdra said:

1. After saying this, Brahma kept quiet remembering Siva. The gods too returned to their respective abodes rejoicingly.
2. Then at the behest of Siva, the celestial sage Narada went to the abode of the Daityas and sang the glory of the beauty of Parvati.
3. On hearing his words the two Daityas were deluded by deception. Afflicted by the god of lust they desired to abduct the goddess.
4. They thought to themselves where and when they would obtain Parvati at the rise of their good fortune.
5. Once Siva was engaged in sports. Parvati too was playing with a ball along with her friends in the presence of Siva.
6. At times she looked up. At times she displayed the lightness of limbs. At times when she took deep breaths, bees hovered round her enticed by the fragrance. At times the bees made her eyes agitated.
7. Flowers from her tresses fell on the ground in front of her. Her cheeks were perspiring. Drops of sweat dripping from the paintings on her cheek brightened up.
8. The lustre of her body spread all round through the partings of her gown. By exerting her too much in beating the ball her red hand became redder than the red lotus.
9. When the ball bounced, her eyes too followed it making the brows to dance thereby. As the goddess mother of the universe was playing, she was seen by the Daityas who were going by the aerial path. They were, as it were, held in the lap by the imminent death.
10. They were the Daityas Vidala and Uptala who had become haughty by the boon of Brahma and by the might of their arms thought the people of the three worlds as insignificant as the blades of grass.
11. Desirous of abducting the goddess as they were tormented by the god of lust, they descended from the sky quickly after adapting the Simbari magic skill.

344. This verse is the repetition of fragments of verses 2 and 3 of this chapter.

20. The two wicked ones of fickle mind approached Parvati in the guise of Siva’s attendants.

21. By the excessive tremulousness of their eyes they were in a trice recognized by Siva, the chastiser of and contemptuous towards the wicked.

22. The lord shot a significant glance at Parvati the destroyer of miseries denoting that they were Daityas and not Ganas. They could assume any form.

23. O dear, she understood the sign of the eyes of her lord Siva, the great lord who indulges in fancies.

24. Realising the significant glance, the goddess, the sharer of half the body of Siva45 hit both of them simultaneously with the ball.

25. The powerful wicked Daitya hit by the ball whirled and whirled and fell on the ground.

26-27. After making the two Daityas fall like two ripe fruits from the palmyra tree when shaken by the wind, or like the two peaks of a great mountain struck by the thunderbolt, as they had attempted to do an evil action, the ball changed itself into the phallic image.

28. That phallic image came to be known as Kandukesvara. It is very near Jyesthesvara. It removes all the wicked things.

29. At the same time, knowing the manifestation of Siva, Visnu, Brahma, other gods and the sages came there.

30. Then all the gods received boons from Siva and at his bidding returned to their respective abodes delightedly. So were the residents of Kasi blessed with the boons.

31. On seeing Siva with Parvati they bowed to him with palms joined in reverence and eulogised him with devotion and pleasing words.

32. O Vyasa, Siva and Parvati too, went delightedly to their abode. The lord favourably disposed to his devotees, an expert in divine sports, had already had his game.

33. The Kandukesvara phallic image at Kasi destroys the wicked, yields worldly pleasures and salvation. Upon the good it bestows desires always.

34. In the Ardhanarishvara form of Siva, Parvati occupies one half and Siva the other half. The form suggests the divine origin of men and women.

Brahma said:

37. After narrating the story of the moon-crested lord, my excellent son, Sanatkumara took leave of Vyasa. Duly honoured by him he then went to Kashi by the aerial path.

38. Thus the section called “Yuddha” has been narrated to you, O excellent sage. In the Compendium called Rudra, it bestows all cherished desires.
